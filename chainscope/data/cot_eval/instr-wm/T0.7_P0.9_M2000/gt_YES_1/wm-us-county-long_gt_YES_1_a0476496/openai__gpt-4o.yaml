        the counties are in the same location. The model explicitly states that Conejos
        County is "southwest of Chaffee County" and describes different positions
        for each county. The NO answer was given because Conejos is southwest rather
        than east, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the parishes are in the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead,
        the NO was given because Tangipahoa Parish is described as being "to the north
        and slightly to the east" rather than directly east of Lafourche Parish. The
        model identified a different directional relationship rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result about the directional relationship between
        the parishes. The model determined that Tangipahoa Parish is not directly
        east of Lafourche Parish, but rather north-northeast.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Conecuh County is north of Escambia
        County while Santa Rosa County is east of Escambia County, indicating different
        relative positions. The NO answer is based on these different positions, not
        on equality.

        the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it specifically states
        that Albany County is "slightly west" of Rockland County, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and provides this as a clear directional conclusion about the relative
        positions of the counties.

        locations are equal. The model explicitly states that "Burke County, NC is
        located further west compared to Saluda County, SC" - indicating a difference
        in position, not equality. The NO answer is based on this difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with no caveats about uncertainty or inability to
        determine. The answer directly addresses the comparative question about geographic
        position.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Burke County
        is west of Saluda County, indicating a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the geographic positions of the two counties, determining
        that Burke County is west (not east) of Saluda County.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Burke County,
        NC is located at a more western longitude compared to Saluda County, SC."
        The NO is based on a difference in position (Burke being more western), not
        on the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion, making a direct comparative judgment that Burke County is
        not east of Saluda County. The model provides a definitive NO answer based
        on comparing their longitudes.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or equal position. Instead, it concludes NO based on their
        relative positions (both being in western regions of their states) and the
        general layout of the states. The model suggests Burke County is actually
        positioned differently from Saluda County, not that they are equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO, Burke
        County, NC is not located east of Saluda County, SC" as its final conclusion.
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states that Burke County
        is west of Saluda County, indicating a difference in position. The NO is based
        on Burke being west rather than east as asked in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Burke County is west (not
        east) of Saluda County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Burke County is northwest of Saluda County, indicating a clear directional
        difference between their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the counties. The model states Burke County is northwest of Saluda County,
        not east of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states that
        "Saluda County is generally further east than Burke County" - indicating a
        difference in position, not equality. The NO answer is based on Burke being
        west of Saluda, not on them being at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether Burke County, NC is east of Saluda County, SC.
        The answer is definitive and comparative, not indicating uncertainty or refusing
        to answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Burke County is
        "west of Saluda County" - indicating a difference in position, not equality.
        The NO is based on Burke being west, not on the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Burke
        County, NC is not located east of Saluda County, SC" as its final answer.
        This is a direct comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it states Metcalfe County is "south
        and a bit east" relative to Bullitt County, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on it not being "directly east" rather than the locations
        being identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Metcalfe County,
        KY is not located directly east of Bullitt County, KY" as its final comparative
        conclusion.

        equal positions. Instead, it indicates that West Feliciana Parish is "more
        to the north" of St. Mary Parish, describing a different relative position
        rather than equality. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not
        equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a positional
        difference, describing St. Mary Parish as "to the south and slightly west"
        of West Feliciana Parish. The NO answer was given because of this directional
        difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative response about the geographical relationship
        between the two parishes. The answer is definitive and based on relative positioning.

    c028102e-2ad4-449f-ad4e-82883fc25850:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there is a directional difference (north and slightly
        west vs south and east). The model explicitly states a directional difference
        exists.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing a clear directional explanation that West Feliciana Parish
        is "north and slightly to the west" of St. Mary Parish rather than east of
        it.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the counties are in the same location. The model explicitly states they are
        in different positions (Maricopa is south of Yavapai). The NO answer was given
        because the relationship is different (south/north) rather than because the
        locations are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Parker County was described as being north of Hood County (a different direction
        than asked about in the question). The model identified a specific directional
        difference rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same
        - instead it explicitly notes that Denton County is "slightly east" of Hill
        County (though primarily north). The NO answer appears to be based on the
        fact that the eastward position is not the primary directional relationship,
        not because the locations are at the same longitude.

        Denton County is "not primarily east" due to being "significantly further
        north," not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same longitude/position. Instead, it explicitly states
        they have a different relative position (one is north of the other). The NO
        is based on directional difference (north vs east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "the answer

        NO answer. The NO is based on relative positioning, not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Based on this analysis,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion, providing a direct comparative
        answer about the relative positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same longitude or equally east/west. Rather, it explains they are both
        along Lake Michigan's shore but differ in north/south positioning. The NO
        answer is based on their relative positions, not because they are at equal
        longitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Sheboygan County
        is not located east of Ozaukee County" as its final comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    dc0aed8c-b0fb-43c7-84d4-11830c45e443:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both counties are aligned
        along the eastern edge and border Lake Michigan, it doesn't explicitly state
        they are at the same longitude or exactly equal in position. Rather, it explains
        that "neither is located east of the other in terms of county boundaries"
        which implies a more complex boundary relationship rather than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear statement "Sheboygan County, WI is not located east of
        Ozaukee County, WI. Therefore, the answer is: NO."'

        they are at the same longitude. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (west vs east), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
