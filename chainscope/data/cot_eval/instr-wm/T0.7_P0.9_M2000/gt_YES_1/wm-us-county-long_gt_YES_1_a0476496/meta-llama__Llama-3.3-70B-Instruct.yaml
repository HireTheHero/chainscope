      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they are "generally at a
        similar longitude," it specifically states that Geary County is "slightly
        west of Dallas County." Since it indicates there is a directional difference
        (even if slight), this is not a case where the NO answer was given because
        the locations are exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Geary County is east of Dallas County. The answer is clearly
        stated and is a direct comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave NO because it determined Geary County would
        be west of Dallas County, not east. The model explicitly noted a directional
        difference in their positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        equal longitudes. In fact, it suggests that "Conejos County... is likely at
        a similar or slightly more western longitude compared to Chaffee County."
        The mention of any difference, even if described as "slightly," means this
        is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are in
        the same location or have equal positions. Instead, it explicitly notes differences
        in their positions, stating that "Conejos County is more to the south and
        slightly west compared to Chaffee County." The NO answer is based on directional
        differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion, making a definitive comparative judgment based

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the counties are at the same
        longitude. Instead, it explicitly states that "Conejos County is more to the
        south and slightly west" of where Chaffee County is located. This difference
        in position, even though described as "slightly west," means the NO answer
        was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer would
        be NO" as a clear comparative result about the relative positions of the counties.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    89288de5-d7ff-426e-90e6-08fed914c1d4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are in
        the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly states
        that Conejos County is southwest of Chaffee County, indicating a clear directional
        difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the answer is: NO" as

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that Conejos County is "south and slightly west" of where Chaffee County
        is located. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Conejos County
        is not east of Chaffee County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same longitude or location. In fact, it explicitly states that Conejos
        County is "west and south of Chaffee County", indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times, including
        as its "Final Answer", and provides a clear comparative conclusion that "Conejos
        County is not located east of Chaffee County."

    dff74b37-bf0f-4dbd-9fd3-18e4387888fd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the counties are at equal
        longitudes. Instead, it explicitly states that Conejos County is "slightly
        west" and describes it as being "southwest" compared to Chaffee County's "central-west"
        position. Since it indicates a difference in position (even if described as
        slight), this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to whether
        Conejos County is located east of Chaffee County would be NO" and provides
        a clear comparative result based on their relative positions.

        same location or have equal positions. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        Conejos County is southwest of Chaffee County, indicating a clear directional
        difference. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same longitude or equally east/west. Instead, it explains that Kemper
        County is not east of George County because of their north-south relationship,
        indicating a different geographical relationship rather than equality as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        it actually specifies that Kemper County is "west and slightly north of George
        County." Since it identifies a directional difference, even if described as
        "slightly," this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but not because the counties
        are in the same location. Instead, it explicitly states that Kemper County
        is "north (and somewhat west, but more accurately, northwest)" of George County,
        indicating a directional difference between their locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the counties, indicating Kemper
        County is not east of George County but rather northwest of it.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES" after its

    49a20dc2-6a6b-44d8-9dbf-83745bec1612:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but not because the counties
        are in the same location. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with Kemper County being "north and slightly west of George County."
        Even though the difference in western position is described as "slight," any
        stated directional difference means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the counties, indicating Kemper
        County is not east of George County (but rather north and slightly west)

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate that the counties are
        at the same longitude or have equal east-west positions. Instead, it states
        that Kemper County is "north or northwest of George County" - indicating a
        difference in position. The NO answer is based on directional differences,

    5c683b8e-1df9-44b4-ae1f-0821cc920ee9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same longitude or location. In fact, it explicitly states that Kemper
        County is "west of George County" and describes their different positions,
        with George County extending more eastward towards the Alabama border. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its reasoning, indicating that Kemper County is not east
        of George County (it states Kemper is actually west of George County).

        being in the same location or having equal positions. Instead, it explicitly
        states that Kemper County is northwest or directly north of George County,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        and explicitly concludes "Kemper County, MS is not located east of George
        County, MS." This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same longitude or in the same position. Instead, it gives NO as an answer
        based on reasoning about relative positions, stating that Illinois is south
        of Wisconsin and the east-west positioning is less relevant. It never claims
        the locations are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        east of Vilas County, WI. Instead, it's more to the south and slightly west."
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference (being slightly west),
        not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions the locations might have
        "similar longitude," it does not state they are exactly equal. Instead, it
        suggests Tazewell County is "south or southeast" and Vilas County is "possibly
        at a similar longitude or slightly west." The presence of any directional
        difference, even if slight, means this is not a case of equal values being
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        presented in bold at the end of its response after detailed analysis. The
        answer is a direct comparative result, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        equal in longitude. Instead, it describes them as "slightly to the east or
        roughly at the same longitude" and gives the primary reason for NO as being
        that Tazewell County "cannot be east of Vilas County, WI, because it is south
        of it." Since it mentions a possible slight difference and bases its NO on
        directional reasoning rather than equality, this doesn't qualify as a NO due
        to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

        location or had equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly stated that "Coke
        County has a longitude that places it somewhat to the east of Sutton County,"
        indicating a difference in position, even if slight. The NO answer was based
        on this difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        it determined Sublette County is west of Sweet Grass County (a directional
        difference). The model never claimed the locations were equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Sublette County is east of Sweet Grass County. The
        answer is based on a comparative directional assessment (west vs east) and
        provides a definitive conclusion.

        Sublette County is "west and somewhat south of Sweet Grass County." It explicitly
        states a directional difference (west vs east) rather than stating the locations
        are at the same longitude.

        to the west of Montana"). The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because Lander County is determined
        to be south/southeast of Wallowa County, not east of it. The model identifies
        a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model concluded NO because
        it determined Lander County is west of Wallowa County (opposite direction).
        The model explicitly states "since Nevada is west of Oregon" and concludes
        Lander County "is not east of Wallowa County, OR, but rather west."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Lander County is "south and somewhat
        east" of Wallowa County, and concludes NO because it is "primarily south"
        rather than directly east. This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lander County is west of Wallowa
        County, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The
        NO answer is given because of this directional difference, not because of
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. Instead, it concludes NO because Lander County is described
        as being "west and possibly slightly south of Wallowa County." Since it indicates
        a directional difference (even if slight), this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer regarding whether Lander County, NV is east of Wallowa County, OR.

        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that Nevada is west
        of Oregon, and therefore Lander County cannot be east of Wallowa County. The
        NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its reasoning that
        Nevada is west of Oregon, therefore Lander County must be west of Wallowa
        County. The model does not state or suggest that the locations have equal
        longitude or are at the same position - it actually indicates they are in
        different positions (one west of the other). Therefore, the NO is not due
        to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Lander County, NV is east of Wallowa County, OR. This is a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - instead, it explicitly states that Lander County is west
        of Wallowa County, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO is based on the opposite direction being true, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that Burke County
        is northwest of Saluda County, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO is based on Burke being northwest rather than east of
        Saluda.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Burke County, NC is east of Saluda County, SC. The

        "similar longitudes" and "roughly at the same longitude," it also notes potential
        slight differences ("Cabarrus County might be slightly west") and doesn't
        use equality as the primary reason for its NO answer. The model discusses
        various geographic factors and positions, suggesting the NO is based on a
        broader analysis rather than exact equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as the final answer, it does
        not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates
        that Hardeman County is "south or southeast" of Ballard County, describing
        a different relative position rather than equality as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold, providing a clear comparative result about the relative positions
        of the counties. The model does not indicate inability to determine or refuse
        to answer.

        that Hardeman County would be "south or slightly southeast of Ballard County"
        - noting a difference in positioning, even if slight. The NO answer appears
        to be because Hardeman is not distinctly east of Ballard, not because they're
        at the same longitude.

        longitudes" and are "essentially at the same east-west position," it specifically
        states that Hardeman County is "slightly to the south and west in terms of
        longitude." Since it indicates there is a slight western difference, even
        if small, this is not a case where the NO answer was given because the locations
        are exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same longitude or have equal east-west positions. Instead, it explains
        that Rutland County is not east of Chittenden County because of their relative
        positions (northwest vs southwest) and that movement between them is primarily
        southward rather than eastward. The NO answer is based on directional difference,

        they are in different positions (Chittenden being closer to the Vermont-New
        York border) and concludes NO based on their relative positions, not because
        of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        the counties are in the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead,
        the NO answer was given because Rutland County is southeast rather than directly
        east of Chittenden County. The model explicitly describes different positions
        for the counties (one southwest, one northwest).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on its geographical analysis. The

        County, and the NO answer is based on the fact that the relationship is southeast
        rather than directly east. Since the model identifies a directional difference
        (even if complex), and does not base its NO answer on equality, this should
        be classified as False.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses some uncertainty about exact
        positions, it does not state that the counties are at the same longitude or
        in the same position. The NO answer appears to be based on geographical reasoning
        about relative positions rather than equality of values. The model never claims
        the locations are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer. While the analysis includes some uncertainty about exact positions,
        it does provide a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same location or have equal positions. Instead, it states that Denton
        County is "north or northwest of Hill County" and uses this directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        based on its geographical analysis, providing a clear comparative conclusion
        about the relative positions of the counties.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are in
        the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly describes
        them as being in different positions, with Denton County being north/northwest
        of Hill County, which is "south and slightly east." The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its analysis, providing a direct comparative result about
        the relative positions of the counties.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the longitudes are "very
        similar" and "almost identical," it explicitly states that "Denton County
        being slightly west but only by a very small margin." Any difference, even
        if described as slight, means this is not a case of equal values being the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold after its analysis, making this a clear NO response to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Denton County is north of Hill County,
        and this directional difference is the reason for the NO answer. The model
        specifically states "Denton County is not east of Hill County; it is more
        to the north."

        noting that Denton County is "slightly west" of Hill County. This directional
        difference, even though described as "slight," means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides a comparative directional conclusion that Denton County cannot
        be east of Hill County because it is positioned more to the north and slightly

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Licking County being west of Vinton County), not because the locations are
        equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        central Ohio (where Licking County is) and southeastern Ohio (where Vinton
        County is).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the longitudes are "very close,"
        it explicitly states that Shoshone County is "slightly east" of Riverside
        County. Since any difference, even if described as slight, means the values
        are not exactly equal, and the NO answer is primarily based on the minimal
        nature of the east-west difference relative to the north-south relationship
        rather than on equality, this does not qualify as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer, providing
        a clear comparative result. While it notes some complexity and qualifies the
        answer, it maintains the NO position based on the minimal east-west difference
        relative to the more significant north-south relationship.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, with Amherst County being "north and slightly
        to the west" of Lynchburg City.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that Amherst County is not east of Lynchburg
        City, explaining it is "primarily located to the north and slightly to the
        west."

        Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying Amherst
        County is "north and slightly west of Lynchburg City." Even though the difference
        might be small ("slightly west"), any stated directional difference means
        we must classify this as False.

        Amherst County is "to the north and slightly west of Lynchburg City" - indicating
        a difference in position, even if slight. The NO is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Shiawassee being west of Clermont), not on the locations being equal. The
        model explicitly states that Michigan is west of Ohio and concludes Shiawassee
        County would be west of Clermont County. It never suggests the locations are
        at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        its final conclusion after its analysis, making this a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.'

    f856cda3-69b1-47af-a45a-756f620a8625:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same longitude or equally east/west. Instead, it explains that they have
        different positions along the lakeshore, with Sheboygan being north of Ozaukee.
        The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" and provides a clear comparative analysis concluding that Sheboygan County
        is not east of Ozaukee County (rather, it''s north).'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states "San Juan County, NM, is generally at a longitude
        slightly west of Musselshell County, MT." Even though it notes this difference
        is "not significantly so," any stated difference (even if described as slight)
        means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion, and this NO is clearly given as a comparative result
        (specifically answering whether San Juan County is east of Musselshell County).'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not relevant since
        we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        in bold at the end of its analysis.

    4f41ce23-4ebe-4956-b177-5a4962e05daf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, concluding
        that "San Juan County, NM, would be south and slightly west of Musselshell
        County, MT." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result based on its geographic analysis,
        not due to inability to determine or rejection of premises.'

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that San Juan County is "west and
        south" of Musselshell County, indicating a directional difference. The NO
        answer is based on San Juan County being west rather than east of Musselshell
        County, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a definitive comparative result based on its geographical
        analysis, determining that San Juan County is west (not east) of Musselshell

    a4ce0c74-d6ce-4b27-be32-59a6730c4a47:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it concluded NO because it found San Juan County to
        be "west or southwest of Musselshell County" - indicating a difference in
        position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, making a clear comparative judgment about the relative positions of
        the two locations.

      result: 'NO'
    a732ad8d-37b6-4e86-8c83-5dc72c3462ed:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that New Mexico (and San Juan County)
        is west of Montana (and Musselshell County), indicating a directional difference.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative conclusion that San Juan County, NM is not located
        east of Musselshell County, MT.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (San Juan County being west of Musselshell County), not because
        the locations are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in longitude, with New Mexico being "at a lower longitude (further west) compared
        to Montana."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        after analyzing the geographical positions and determining that San Juan County

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration only applies
        when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: **YES**"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that San Juan County, NM is "generally
        west" of where Musselshell County, MT is located, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its analysis, providing a direct comparative result about the relative
        positions of the counties.
