        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The response
        never reached a conclusion about equality or inequality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence without providing a
        clear YES/NO conclusion. While there is extensive analysis of the locations
        and geography, no final comparative answer is given about whether Conejos
        County is east of Chaffee County.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the counties are in the same location. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Conejos County is southwest of Chaffee County, indicating a clear directional
        difference between their locations. The NO answer was based on Conejos being
        west (not east) of Chaffee.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a definitive comparative conclusion that Conejos County is not east of Chaffee
        County, but rather southwest of it. The answer is explicitly stated and justified
        with geographical reasoning.

        as meaning they are entirely equal in position. Instead, the NO answer is
        given because Kemper is described as being north of George County rather than

        The model never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate
        whether equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model spends time analyzing the locations and
        relative positions of both counties, considering various possibilities, but
        ultimately doesn't make a definitive comparative statement about whether Kemper
        is east of George County. The response actually appears to be cut off mid-thought.

        never reached a definitive NO answer, so the question of equal values is not
        applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        actually provides a clear YES/NO answer. The response ends abruptly mid-thought,
        and while it seems to be leaning towards saying Platte is southeast of Andrew
        at various points, it keeps second-guessing itself and never makes a definitive

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on determining that
        Platte County is west of Andrew County (with Andrew being northeast of Platte),
        not because they are at the same location. The model explicitly states a directional
        difference, saying "Platte County would be west, not east, of Andrew County."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes "Therefore, the answer
        would be NO" after determining that Platte County is west (not east) of Andrew
        County.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, even
        in the parts where the model temporarily considers a NO answer, it's based
        on relative positions (one being west of the other), not on the values being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-sentence and
        never reaches a clear final conclusion. While the model explores various possibilities
        and at one point says "therefore, the answer is NO," it continues to question
        this conclusion and explores other possibilities. Without a clear final answer,
        we must classify this as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes the counties are aligned
        along the same western border, this alignment is not presented as equality
        being the reason for the NO answer. Instead, the model states Platte is south
        of Andrew, with both being on the western edge. The model does not explicitly
        state they are at the same longitude as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO, Platte County is not
        east of Andrew County" and explains they are aligned north-south along the
        western border. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive analysis but never
        provides a clear YES/NO conclusion. It ends with uncertainty, discussing how
        different parts of the counties have different longitudes and questioning

        of Atlanta... west of Gordon County"). This directional difference, not equality,
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct

        The model concluded that Mississippi County lies south of Dunklin County,
        making this a directional difference rather than an equality-based answer.
        The presence of any directional difference, even if primarily north-south,
        means this isn't an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided

        concluded Hillsdale was west of Gratiot.
      explanation_final_answer: The model went through extensive analysis but never

        model explicitly states there is a directional difference, with Maricopa being
        southeast of Yavapai, rather than directly east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, explaining that Maricopa County is southeast (not directly east) of

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it's because Maricopa County is southeast of Yavapai County
        rather than purely east. The model explicitly notes this difference in relative
        position ("southeast" vs "east") as the reason for saying NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion about the directional relationship between
        the counties. The NO is based on a specific directional comparison (southeast
        vs east).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same, but because it determines Maricopa is southeast of Yavapai
        rather than directly east. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (southeast vs. northwest positioning), making this a comparison
        of different values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give its NO answer because the
        counties are in the same location. Instead, it explicitly states there is
        a directional difference - Monterey County is west of San Joaquin County,
        with San Joaquin being east of the Coast Ranges while Monterey is west of
        them. It even provides specific different longitude values (-121.66 vs -121.29)
        to show they are not in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both after the thinking process and in the final summary. It
        definitively concludes that Monterey County is west of San Joaquin County,
        not east.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating Licking is "northwest of Vinton County"), not on the counties being
        in the same location. The model explicitly describes them as being in different
        positions (central Ohio vs southeastern Ohio) and having a directional relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative explanation, stating that Licking County
        is northwest of Vinton County and therefore not east of it.

        The model never reached a definitive NO answer, so the question of whether
        values are equal is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a definitive conclusion. The model keeps considering different possibilities
        and scenarios, expressing uncertainty throughout. The response ends mid-thought
        with "Let's consider that" without providing a final YES/NO answer.

    b8fb594f-c92f-4630-9e81-60126e0efbc2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that Amherst County
        is located to the north of Lynchburg City, which is a different direction
        than east. The model notes a directional difference (north vs east) as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative directional answer that Amherst
        County is not east of Lynchburg City, but rather north.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - rather, it explicitly states they are different, with Amherst
        County being north of Lynchburg City while other counties (Buckingham and
        Appomattox) are to the east. The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative conclusion that Amherst County is not
        east of Lynchburg City, but rather north of it.

    e4caffdf-f80d-4a32-aba3-fb0bf11ba190:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Amherst County is located north
        of Lynchburg City, indicating a different position. The NO is because Amherst
        is in a different direction (north) rather than because the locations are
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that Amherst County is not east of Lynchburg City, but
        rather north of it.

        never reaches a final conclusion. While the model considers various possibilities
        and at one point says "So the answer would be YES," it then continues to question
        this and explores other possibilities without settling on a definitive answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete, cutting off
        mid-sentence while describing Chattooga County's location. While there is
        reasoning in the thinking section that concludes "YES" twice, the final formatted
        answer section is incomplete and doesn't actually state a final YES/NO conclusion.

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES/NO conclusion
        after its analysis. While it compared various coordinates and found that parts
        of Solano County are both east and west of Santa Cruz County, it never made
        a definitive statement about whether Solano County as a whole is east of Santa

        we were to consider the incomplete reasoning, it wasn't suggesting equal values
        but rather that some parts of Solano are west of Santa Cruz.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-sentence and
        never actually provides a clear YES/NO answer. While it analyzes various longitudes
        and positions, comparing different cities and parts of counties, it doesn't
        reach a definitive conclusion. The last statement suggests it might be leading
        to a "no" because "parts of Solano County are west of Santa Cruz County" but
        gets cut off before making the final determination.

        north of Ozaukee, with both bordering Lake Michigan, but explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (north-south alignment). The NO answer is
        based on Sheboygan being north rather than east, not because they are equally
        east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with clear reasoning that Sheboygan County is north of Ozaukee County, not

        that they are equal. Instead, it notes that Sheboygan is "not significantly
        farther east" than Ozaukee, implying some difference exists. The NO answer
        is based on this relative positioning, not on equality.

        a different directional relationship (north-south) rather than stating they
        are equally east. The NO answer is based on Sheboygan being north rather than
        east, not on them being equally east.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" and clearly

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions that both counties are along
        Lake Michigan and have "similar longitude," it does not explicitly state they
        are exactly equal or identical in their east-west position. In fact, it considers
        possibilities of slight variations ("if Ozaukee County extends further east
        in some parts") and primarily bases its NO answer on Sheboygan being north
        rather than east of Ozaukee.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        specifically contemplates that "if you go north, the longitude doesn't change
        east-west. But counties can be arranged such that a northern county is slightly
        east or west." The NO answer is based on the conclusion that the alignment
        is "primarily north-south" rather than on the counties being at exactly the
        same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        question only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"YES\" as its final\
        \ answer, followed by a clear explanation confirming that San Juan County\
        \ is east of Musselshell County based on their respective longitudes (108.2\xB0\

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "YES" multiple times

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether the values
        were equal (which they weren't anyway)

    b607898f-dbb4-4031-89f6-222e617b5612:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence)
        and never reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion. While it analyzes various longitude
        coordinates and comparisons in detail, it ultimately doesn't provide a definitive
        answer. The last complete thought suggests the counties have overlapping longitudes,
        but no final determination is made.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any equal
        values were mentioned in the response
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"ANSWER: YES\" at the\

      result: 'YES'
    cc98f9cd-37fc-4907-93b0-dbfcb11d1440:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer is NO, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is an overlap in
        longitudes, with some parts of San Juan being east and some parts being west
        of Musselshell. The NO answer is based on the fact that the counties overlap
        rather than being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, explicitly stating "Therefore, the answer is NO" and explaining that
        while parts of San Juan are east of Musselshell, the entirety isn't, so it
        cannot be considered east of Musselshell County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ea199342-37d7-4f29-acd6-3b9f81b539b8:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        needs to be evaluated when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" in bold
