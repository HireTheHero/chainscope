      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        that Conejos County is "slightly west" of Chaffee County. This indicates a
        difference in position, not equality, even though the difference is described
        as "slight". Any difference, no matter how small, means we should classify
        this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Conejos County is not

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly stated there was a difference, saying "Kemper County
        is actually slightly WEST of George County's longitude". Even though the difference
        is described as "slight", any stated difference means this should be classified
        as False.

        False. The equal values criteria only apply when evaluating NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES, Jackson
        County is located east of McDonald County." This is a clear YES answer to
        the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    9ba30fa9-bf85-40fa-be6a-009fa88066bd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Jackson County being "slightly WEST" of McDonald County), not
        because the locations are equal. Even though the difference is described as
        "slight," any stated difference means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on its analysis
        that Jackson County is slightly west (not east) of McDonald County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b0bd29f8-64c3-4916-b7ad-204aef85a55f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions that the counties are "roughly
        at the same longitude" and "both on the western edge," this is not given as
        the primary reason for the NO answer. Instead, the NO is given because Jackson
        County is "not positioned to the east" of McDonald County (being north of
        it instead). The mention of similar longitude is secondary to this directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing it as a direct conclusion
        after its step-by-step analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b7b005e9-27d2-43cf-bc88-2e5863bb0867:

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, saying Jackson County is "slightly west" of McDonald County.
        Even though the difference is described as small, any stated difference means
        the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Jackson County is NOT east
        of McDonald County - it's actually slightly west of it."

    bff33dfe-7408-4d90-9759-fa9527a668c6:

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Jackson County
        is "slightly WEST of McDonald County". This indicates a difference in position,
        even if described as "slight", making this a directional difference rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including "NO, Jackson County is not east of McDonald County" and concludes
        with "The answer is: NO". This is a clear comparative NO answer.'

    d13da67e-e772-4c4e-ad52-c8c44bd31388:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference between the counties'
        locations (first saying Jackson is east of McDonald, then correcting to say
        it's west). Even though the model contradicted itself on the direction, it
        clearly based its answer on a difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, followed by a correction to its reasoning. Despite the self-correction,
        the model gave a clear NO as its final answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Tazewell County is west of
        Vilas County, indicating a directional difference between their positions.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Tazewell County, IL
        is not located east of Vilas County, WI" as its final comparative conclusion.
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    b94d4dcc-e59e-452a-8d9c-80ec44aeed74:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Tazewell County
        is west of Vilas County, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Tazewell County,
        IL is NOT located east of Vilas County, WI" and provides a clear comparative
        result, stating that Tazewell County is actually west of Vilas County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d76bddcc-0fa9-40ac-a713-5d9db94e556a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that "Vilas County is significantly
        further east than Tazewell County" and concludes that Tazewell is west of
        Vilas.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Tazewell County, IL
        is not located east of Vilas County, WI" and provides a definitive comparative
        result that it is west of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    f2637426-f21f-442b-97bb-ced9baf401c4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the counties having
        different positions, with Vilas being east of Tazewell. The model does not
        state or suggest they are at equal positions - it explicitly states one is
        east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining why Tazewell County cannot be east of Vilas County. This
        is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes a directional difference, stating
        that Winona County is west of Washburn County. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly describes a difference in position,
        stating that Wisconsin's western border (where Washburn County is) is further
        east than Winona County's location. The NO appears to be answering whether
        Winona County is east of Washburn County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final conclusion
        after walking through the geographical comparison. This is a direct comparative
        answer without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Washburn
        County is "further east" than Winona County - indicating a difference in position,
        not equality. The model never states or suggests the counties are at the same
        longitude; rather, it explicitly notes a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Winona County
        is not east of Washburn County" after its step-by-step analysis. This is a

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are "roughly aligned on the
        same north-south line" as the reason for the NO answer, indicating they are
        at approximately the same longitude. This equality in east-west positioning
        is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Platte County is

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that Platte County is "slightly more
        western" than Andrew County. Even though they are described as "roughly aligned,"
        the model explicitly notes a directional difference, which means they are
        not exactly equal. Any stated difference, even if described as slight, means
        we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this is clearly meant as a comparative result rather than inability
        to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the counties
        being at equal positions. Instead, it explains that since the counties are
        aligned north-south (with Andrew directly north of Platte), one cannot be
        east of the other. This is a directional difference reason, not an equality
        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response based
        on geographical reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model states the counties are aligned north/south
        (implying same longitude), it does not explicitly state they are at the exact
        same longitude/equally east/west. Instead, it explains the NO answer by describing
        their north/south alignment as the reason why neither can be east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Platte County is
        not east of Andrew County" and provides a clear comparative result, explaining
        they are aligned north/south.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they are "roughly aligned on
        the same longitude," it explicitly states that "Platte County is slightly
        to the west of Andrew County." Since it identifies a directional difference
        (even if slight), this is not a case of equal values being the reason for
        the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that Platte County is "very slightly
        west" of Andrew County. Even though this difference is described as very slight,
        any stated difference means the values are not equal, so this is not a case
        of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the counties.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that the counties are "at roughly
        the same longitude" and "Neither county is east of the other - they are aligned
        vertically". This equality in position is presented as the reason for the
        NO answer, with no differences noted.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the counties
        being at the same longitude/having equal east-west positions. Instead, it
        explains that they are aligned north/south of each other, with Platte being
        directly south of Andrew. While this implies they share a longitude, the NO
        answer is based on their relative positions, not on stating they are equal
        or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Platte County is
        not east of Andrew County" as its final comparative answer, providing a clear

        longitudes. Instead, it notes "a slight eastward shift" and that they "share
        roughly the same longitude range" but explicitly acknowledges some difference
        in position ("slightly southeast"). The NO answer is based on the difference
        not being "meaningful" rather than the positions being equal.

        being different (Calvert being south of Anne Arundel), not because the values
        being compared are equal. The model explicitly states "Calvert County is south
        of Anne Arundel County" and concludes NO based on this directional difference.

        aligned on the same north-south axis," suggesting they are approximately at
        the same longitude. This equal east-west positioning is the primary reason
        given for the NO answer, as the model explicitly states "Calvert County is
        not positioned east of Anne Arundel County" because they share this alignment.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both counties are on the
        west bank of the Hudson River, this similarity is not given as the reason
        for the NO answer. Instead, the NO is based on their north-south positioning,
        with the model stating that Albany County is north of Rockland County rather

        even if described as slight, means the values are not exactly equal, this
        should be classified as False.

        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in longitude ("Caddo Parish is slightly further west than Faribault County")
        and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. Even though the
        difference is described as "slight," any stated difference means this is not
        a case of equal values.

        difference (even if slight), this is not a case of equal values being the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its

        County" - even though this difference is described as slight, any stated difference
        means the values are not equal

    96bee758-6bfc-4e19-8262-b77e473ebc95:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same longitude or position. Instead, it gives a NO answer because Rutland
        is south of Chittenden (indicating different positions), and explains that
        Rutland cannot be east of Chittenden because both are on Vermont's western
        edge.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the geographical positions of the counties.

        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that "Rutland County is slightly
        WEST of Chittenden County." Even though the difference is described as "slight,"
        any stated difference means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Rutland County is south of
        Chittenden County (indicating a difference in position) and bases its NO answer
        on the fact that Rutland is south rather than east of Chittenden.

    d47dcc04-9ad6-438a-b119-bf2bf3be65e7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the counties are "roughly
        aligned on the western edge," this is not stated as the reason for the NO
        answer. The model's conclusion appears to be based on the fact that "Rutland
        County is not positioned east of Chittenden County" rather than them being
        exactly equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both counties are on the
        western border and "roughly aligned on a north-south axis," it does not state
        they are at the same longitude or that equality is the reason for the NO answer.
        Instead, it gives a directional explanation (Rutland being south of Chittenden)
        to support why Rutland is not east of Chittenden.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the counties, making this a definitive
        NO response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they are "roughly on the same
        longitude," it then states that "Stafford County is slightly west of Richmond"
        - indicating a difference, even if small. Since any stated difference disqualifies
        it from being classified as equal values, this is False.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Stafford County is "slightly west of
        Richmond City". This indicates a difference in position, even if described
        as "slight", making this a directional difference rather than equality
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative conclusion
        that Stafford County is not east of Richmond City (stating it's "actually
        slightly west")

    4117dfb6-b66e-4a5f-9262-23c85957454a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it states there is a directional difference
        (northeast vs east). The model explicitly notes that Stafford County is northeast
        of Richmond, not directly east, which indicates a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO - Stafford
        County is northeast of Richmond City, not directly east of it." This is a
        clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they are "roughly on the
        same north-south longitude line," it also states "with Stafford being slightly
        west if anything." Since it notes this slight directional difference, even
        if tiny, this does not qualify as stating they are exactly equal as the primary
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Stafford County is
        not east of Richmond City" as its comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    61f1d8f3-530e-49a9-aa59-4bb11a2a58b7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same
        - it actually notes that "Stafford is very slightly east of Richmond." Even
        though it describes this as a slight difference, any stated difference means
        we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer and
        maintains this position in its final clarifying statement.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        ("north and slightly east"). The NO is based on Stafford not being "directly
        east" rather than on equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Stafford County,
        VA is not located east of Richmond City, VA" as its comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Stafford County is slightly
        west of Richmond" - indicating a difference in position, even if slight. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, determining that Stafford
        County is slightly west of Richmond.

        is actually slightly west of Richmond" and uses this directional difference
        (not equality) as the basis for its NO answer. Even though the difference
        is described as "slight," any stated difference means this is not a case of
        equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they are "roughly on the same
        north-south corridor" and "There isn't a significant east-west offset", it
        still indicates that "Stafford County is slightly east of I-95, while Richmond
        straddles it" - showing they are not exactly equal in position. The NO answer
        is based on rejecting the eastward relationship, not on them being in identical
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO - Stafford
        County is not east of Richmond City" as a clear comparative answer

        classify this as equal values being the reason for the NO answer.

        County." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        Any indication of a difference, even if described as slight, means we cannot
        classify this as equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion in parentheses. While it notes uncertainty,

        on their eastern borders", it explicitly states that Maricopa County "extends
        further west" and is "slightly west and south" of Yavapai County. Since it
        identifies a directional difference (even if slight), this is not a case of
        equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a comparative directional conclusion that Maricopa County is
        "slightly west and south" of Yavapai County rather than east of it.

        does not explicitly state they are exactly equal in position, and this is
        not given as the primary reason for the NO answer. The description suggests
        they overlap but are not necessarily identical in their east-west positioning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the counties
        being in the same location or having equal positions. Instead, it explicitly
        states that Maricopa is south of Yavapai, indicating a clear directional difference
        as the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model states they are "roughly aligned on
        the east-west axis," it also notes that "Maricopa extends slightly further
        west than Yavapai." Since it indicates there is a difference in position (even
        if slight), this does not qualify as stating they are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, explaining that Maricopa County is not east of Yavapai
        County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the counties were equal/same
        in position - it actually noted differences, saying "Maricopa extends slightly
        further east than Yavapai" and described them as "mostly aligned" but not
        identical. The NO was based on Maricopa not being "entirely or predominantly
        east" rather than on equality.

        This suggests they are approximately at the same longitude, and this equality
        is the primary reason given for the NO answer. The model does not indicate
        any directional difference, even a slight one.

        than Yavapai, indicating a difference (even if small). While it mentions they
        "span roughly the same longitude range," this is not given as the reason for

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the counties were at equal
        positions - in fact, it explicitly noted differences in their east-west positioning,
        stating that Yavapai extends further west and Maricopa extends further east,
        with overlap. The NO answer was based on this overlap pattern rather than
        equality.

        and "neither county is significantly east or west of the other," it does not
        explicitly state they are exactly equal in longitude or use equality as the
        primary reason for the NO answer. Instead, it emphasizes the south-north relationship
        as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Maricopa County

        is not east of Rabun County, GA" and provides a clear comparative result,
        indicating Oakland County is slightly west of Rabun County.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are "at approximately the same
        longitude" and explicitly uses this equality as the reason for its NO answer,
        saying "Since they are at approximately the same longitude, neither is significantly
        east of the other." This equality is the primary basis for the NO response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO - Oakland
        County, MI is not located east of Rabun County, GA" making this a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Blair County is
        "more inland/western" and Johnston County is "more coastal/eastern", indicating
        a difference in position. The NO is based on Blair being west of Johnston,
        not because they're at the same longitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        counties are in different positions (one coastal/western, one inland/central-eastern),
        not because they are in the same location. It explicitly states there is a
        directional difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after analyzing
        the relative positions of the counties, determining that El Dorado County
        is east of San Luis Obispo County, not the other way around.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states that San
        Luis Obispo County is "definitively west of" El Dorado County, indicating
        a clear difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that San Luis Obispo County is
        not east of El Dorado County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - in fact, it explicitly stated they were in different positions (San
        Luis Obispo County on the coast in western California, El Dorado County near
        Nevada in eastern California). The NO appears to be a response to the original
        comparison question rather than indicating equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations of both counties and determining
        their relative positions.

    ae58cbf2-b2a4-4272-9221-3d91e552a80c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        San Luis Obispo County is west of El Dorado County, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations and determining that San Luis Obispo
        County is west, not east, of El Dorado County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it actually stated they were in different positions (SLO on western
        edge, El Dorado in eastern part) and used this difference to make its determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        equal - in fact, it explicitly stated they were in different positions (SLO
        on the coast in western California, El Dorado in eastern California). The
        NO appears to be answering whether El Dorado is west of SLO, not indicating
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the counties were at equal
        positions - instead, it explicitly noted they were in different positions
        (one western, one eastern) and gave NO because San Luis Obispo is west of
        El Dorado, not east. The NO was based on a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on San Luis Obispo
        County being west of El Dorado County, not because the locations are at the
        same longitude. The model explicitly describes their different positions (one
        on the coast, one in the Sierra Nevada) and states that one must be west of
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question of whether San Luis Obispo County
        is east of El Dorado County.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states that Rockwall County
        is further east than Osage County, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO answer was based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Osage County,
        OK is not located east of Rockwall County, TX." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        it explicitly states that Osage County is "slightly WEST of Rockwall County."
        Since it identifies a directional difference (even if slight), this is not
        a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined Pleasants County is west of Wilkes County, indicating
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a directional
        explanation that Pleasants County is west, not east, of Wilkes County. This

        is based on the counties having the same eastern position, making them equal
        in terms of eastward position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the geographical positions of the counties.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    41dfbe8d-1d88-4459-a756-aaefe63dcca9:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "neither county is east of the
        other" because they share roughly the same eastern boundary along Lake Michigan.
        This indicates they have approximately equal eastern positions, and this equality
        is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion after its step-by-step analysis.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    52160e20-db81-44e8-a5f4-4b695fe14321:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same longitude or equally east. Instead, it explains that they cannot
        be compared on an east-west basis because they both border Lake Michigan and
        are aligned north-south. This is a different reason than equality for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the counties
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9071fb71-b8b3-4d4d-b026-782fc99b05be:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the counties
        being at equal eastern positions. Instead, it explains that they are aligned
        along Lake Michigan but emphasizes that Sheboygan is "directly north" rather
        than east of Ozaukee. The NO is based on directional difference (north vs
        east), not on equality of eastern position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response without
        any caveats about inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b5ed106d-39f7-4bf4-b481-8bcbe5bcb98e:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both counties "share the same
        Lake Michigan coastline on their eastern borders" and concludes that "neither
        county is east of the other." This indicates they have the same eastern position,
        and this equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that neither county is east of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    f22aaa14-4055-4e06-998e-6d47fb871c30:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "neither county is east of the
        other" because they are aligned along the same shoreline with Lake Michigan
        as their eastern border. This indicates they have the same eastern position,
        and this equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that neither county is east of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN

    080721bf-8125-4bc9-891f-e6b6372b3479:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal - the model explicitly states that Musselshell County
        is "quite a bit further east" than San Juan County's position. The NO is based
        on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after explaining
        that Musselshell County is east of San Juan County, not west of it. This is
        a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    389ea3a7-d0fc-4c50-8dce-a31a60e69987:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that San Juan County, NM is "actually
        WEST of" Musselshell County, MT, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions and concluding that San Juan County,
        NM is west of Musselshell County, MT
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4a90dc43-5fce-4761-b8b3-d5654a8e9fbf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that San
        Juan County is west of Musselshell County, not because the locations are at
        equal longitudes. The model explicitly states there is a difference in position
        ("San Juan County must be WEST of Musselshell County").
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion after determining San Juan County is west of Musselshell
        County.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5c9b9040-651b-4ada-94be-afd91744b4f8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states that
        San Juan County is WEST of Musselshell County, indicating a directional difference
        between their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that San Juan County is west (not east) of Musselshell County. This is a direct
        comparative answer to the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly concluded that San Juan County must be WEST of Musselshell
        County, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after working through the geographical positions step by
        step.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        longitude. Instead, it explicitly states that San Juan County "must be west
        of Musselshell County" and gives this directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result stating that San Juan County is NOT
        east of Musselshell County (in fact stating it is west).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6f2bb524-bfea-4ca8-85e0-9251cb806598:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitudes. Instead, it explicitly states that San Juan County is further
        west than Musselshell County, giving this difference in position as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether San Juan County is east of Musselshell County.
        The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference, saying "Musselshell County
        is actually further east than San Juan County"
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Musselshell County is further east than San Juan County
