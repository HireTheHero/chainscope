      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Kansas is west of Texas). The NO answer appears to be based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing reasoning about relative positions
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying "Kansas is west of Texas" and concluding "Geary County, KS is west
        of Dallas County, TX". The NO answer appears to be based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing reasoning about the relative positions of the locations.

    4e853e0a-6adb-4ece-80d3-5cc094593b2f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        concluding that "Kansas is west of Texas" and "Geary County, KS would be west
        of Dallas County, TX". The NO answer appears to be based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing reasoning about the relative positions of the locations.

    62b6847a-b270-4ae4-96de-3ccaf598a3fc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it concluded NO based on its determination that Geary
        County is west of Dallas County, indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing its reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6b435325-5a7e-425a-abdc-59a9bd1af041:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes that Geary County is "slightly east"
        of Dallas County, though it emphasizes this isn't "fully east". Since it notes
        a difference (even if slight) rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Geary County is east of Dallas County. This is a clear comparative
        result, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        concluding that "Kansas is west of Texas" and therefore "Geary County, KS
        is west of Dallas County, TX". The NO answer appears to be based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing reasoning about the relative positions of the counties.

    ae2cc994-3502-4dac-b064-0022355fed32:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        or same longitude. Instead, it indicated that Geary County is "likely west
        of" Dallas County, suggesting a difference in longitude as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    e4b0512e-6ca0-4155-93d3-bec573a6f239:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it determined that Geary County is west of Dallas County. The NO
        appears to indicate that one location is west of the other, not that they
        are at the same longitude
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning
      final_answer: 'NO'

    e642d0fa-1f57-413e-aff0-a169d8b77312:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it explicitly stated there was a directional difference, concluding
        that "Geary County, KS is west of Dallas County, TX". The NO answer appears
        to be incorrect given the reasoning provided, but we must evaluate based on
        what was explicitly stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its reasoning steps about the relative positions of the counties.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same longitude. Instead, it explicitly states that Kemper County is "slightly
        west" of George County. Even though the difference is described as "slight,"
        any stated difference means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - it explicitly states that Kemper County is "north and slightly
        west" of George County, indicating a difference in position. The NO is based
        on Kemper being west (opposite of east) rather than any equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Kemper County is north and slightly west of George County,
        not east of it. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on reasoning that Texas is
        west of North Dakota, making it unlikely for Foard County to be east of Kidder
        County. The answer indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after reasoning about the relative positions of the counties based

        determine relative position, it doesn't indicate that the NO answer is due
        to the counties being in the same location. Without an explicit statement
        about equality being the reason for the NO answer, we must classify this as
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "NO" as its final answer without
        any qualifications or uncertainty. While the steps listed don't show the conclusion,

        the river. The NO answer was based on this difference in position, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this was a direct response to the comparison being made about
        longitudinal positions, not a rejection of premises or inability to determine.

        County is further west than Sweet Grass County") before giving its NO answer.
        Even though this seems contradictory with the NO answer, we must take the
        response at face value and note that equality was not given as the reason
        for the NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a directional difference, stating that Stark
        County is "likely west of" Wirt County, and gave this directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer based on its reasoning that Stark
        County would be west of Wirt County (indicating a difference in position),
        due to Ohio being generally west of West Virginia.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same. Instead, it gave a directional difference, stating that Stark County
        is "likely west of" Wirt County, and used this directional difference as the
        basis for its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Live Oak County is west of
        Kingman County, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer appears
        to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing reasoning about the relative positions of the counties.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    97e4bc6c-92fd-4d7e-b75f-59dadb1d2ba6:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that the counties are "roughly along
        the same line of longitude" (both at approximately -98 degrees) and this equality
        is the primary reason given for the NO answer, stating "Since Live Oak County
        is roughly on the same line of longitude as Kingman County, it is neither
        east nor west."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Live Oak County is neither east nor west of Kingman County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same in any way. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Live Oak County is south of Kingman County rather than east of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model stated that Kingman County is "slightly
        west" of Live Oak County. Even though this difference is described as "slight,"
        any stated directional difference means the locations are not equal in longitude,
        so this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating Live Oak County is not east of Kingman County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. It simply gave steps for determining relative positions and then
        stated "NO" without explaining the reason for the answer. Since equality was
        not mentioned as the reason for the NO answer, this should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer
        without any qualifications or uncertainty

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explains that Calvert County is southeast of
        Anne Arundel County, with some portions even being west. The NO answer is
        based on directional differences, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the counties. This is a clear comparative
        result, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it described Calvert County as being "across the water
        to the east" of Anne Arundel County, indicating a directional difference,
        even if slight. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference
        rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it found that while there
        is "some easterly components," Calvert County is "primarily south" of Anne
        Arundel County. This indicates a difference in position, not equality, as
        the reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not explicitly
        state that the locations were equal or identical. The model simply listed
        steps and gave a NO answer without explaining the reason. Without an explicit
        statement about equality being the reason for the NO, we must classify this
        as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after listing steps to determine relative positions. While the steps don't
        show the actual comparison, there is a clear NO answer given.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states "Livingston County is significantly west of
        Presque Isle County." The NO answer appears to be based on this difference
        in position, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates there is a directional difference, noting
        that one is in the lower peninsula and one is in the upper peninsula, with
        a relative positioning described ("south and generally east"). Since it notes
        a difference in position, even if complex, this cannot be classified as equal
        values.

        equal positions. Instead, it indicates they are in different locations (one
        in lower peninsula near Detroit, one in upper peninsula northeastern side)
        and concludes that Livingston is "not east of" Presque Isle. The NO answer
        is based on relative positioning, not equality of position.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Mississippi County, AR is
        "further west" than Dunklin County, MO, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Mississippi County, AR is further west than Dunklin
        County, MO. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

    13eac8e1-ac41-4936-818a-0348bf8eb3ee:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the relative positions
        of the counties (one west of the river, one east of the river), not because
        they are at the same location. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in their positions, with one being west and one being east of the Mississippi
        River.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining why Mississippi County, AR cannot be east of
        Dunklin County, MO based on their positions relative to the Mississippi River.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        the locations were equal. The model explicitly stated that Mississippi County
        is west of Dunklin County, indicating a difference in position. The NO appears
        to be in response to whether Mississippi County is east of Dunklin County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Mississippi County, AR is west of Dunklin County, MO.
        This is a clear comparative result.

        and concludes that "Burke County, NC is likely WEST of Saluda County, SC"
        before giving its NO answer. Even though there appears to be an inconsistency
        between the reasoning and the final NO answer, we must evaluate based on what
        was explicitly stated, which indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, after reasoning about the relative positions of the counties.

        - instead, it found that Maricopa County is south of Yavapai County (a different
        directional relationship than what was being asked about). The NO was based
        on finding a different directional relationship, not because of equal positions.

        though the difference is described as "slight," any stated difference means
        this is not a case of equal values.

        - that since Yavapai is north of Maricopa, Maricopa cannot be east of it.
        The NO is based on relative positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        where "Maricopa is slightly to the east of the western edge of Yavapai, but
        mostly south and a little west." Since it indicates directional differences,
        even if described as "slightly" or "little," this does not qualify as equal

        or the same. Instead, it walks through reasoning steps and concludes NO based
        on relative geographical positions, indicating Michigan is "north and west
        of Georgia." The NO appears to be based on this directional analysis, not
        on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after laying out its reasoning steps. This is an explicit NO answer to the

        of Wilkes County. The NO answer is based on this difference in position, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer, stating
        that West Virginia is west of North Carolina, therefore Pleasants County cannot
        be east of Wilkes County. The NO is based on a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state or suggest that the locations
        were equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly stated "Pleasants County is
        west of Wilkes County" and that "West Virginia is significantly west of North
        Carolina." The NO answer appears to contradict its own reasoning, but nowhere
        did it claim equal values as the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after its step-by-step analysis, though this seems to contradict its
        reasoning which suggested Pleasants County is west of Wilkes County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same/identical - it explicitly states that Amherst County is "directly
        to the west (left) of Lynchburg City", indicating a directional difference.
        Even though it uses the word "directly", it still indicates a western position
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it indicated a directional
        difference (Amherst County is to the west of Lynchburg City), which means
        there is a positional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative

        - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Amherst
        County is "mostly west" of Lynchburg City, with a small portion extending
        "slightly east"). Since it indicates a directional difference, even if parts
        are described as "slight," this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and provides directional reasoning (Amherst County being mostly west
        of Lynchburg City) to support this answer.

        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after analyzing
        the relative positions of Amherst County and Lynchburg City, determining that
        while Amherst County borders Lynchburg on multiple sides, the majority of
        its landmass lies to the east.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its reasoning that
        Shiawassee County is west of Clermont County (due to Michigan being west of
        Ohio), not because the locations have equal coordinates. The model indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there is a directional difference
        (Shiawassee County is west of Clermont County). The NO appears to indicate
        that one location is west of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Lucas County being
        west of Claiborne County, not because they are at the same longitude. The
        model explicitly states "Ohio is generally west of Tennessee" and concludes
        that Lucas County is "not east of" Claiborne County because of this directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are in
        the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it explains that Solano
        County is north and slightly east of Santa Cruz County, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on the reasoning that Solano County is
        primarily north rather than east of Santa Cruz County, not because of equal
        positions.

        The model explicitly noted differences in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, after analyzing the relative positions of the counties
        and determining that while there is some eastward displacement, it doesn't
        satisfy the requirement of being "east" primarily.

        describing a directional difference. The NO answer appears to be based on
        this directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d45e043f-25aa-4ac3-a746-9348abeeb12c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not explicitly
        state that the counties are in the same location or have equal positions.
        The model simply listed steps and gave a NO answer without explaining the
        reason for the NO
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "NO" as its final answer without
        any qualifications or uncertainty
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d68ad269-4835-4a1c-aa0e-935b735f7875:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the counties were in
        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it stated that Sheboygan County
        is "directly north" of Ozaukee County, indicating a clear directional difference.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the counties.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    0094505e-3d6a-4eb5-aacf-5b207ca917fc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        San Juan County was determined to be west of Musselshell County, indicating
        a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final answer after reasoning about the relative positions of the counties,
        determining that San Juan County cannot be east of Musselshell County because
        it is west of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude. Instead, it explicitly states that "New Mexico is west of
        Montana" and concludes that "San Juan County, NM is west of Musselshell County,
        MT". The NO answer is based on a directional difference (west vs east), not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether San Juan County, NM is east of Musselshell County,
        MT. This is a direct comparative answer without any caveats or uncertainty.
