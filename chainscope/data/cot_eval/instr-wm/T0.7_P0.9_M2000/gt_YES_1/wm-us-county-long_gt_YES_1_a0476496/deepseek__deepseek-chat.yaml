        if slight), this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly states that McCormick
        County is northwest of Manatee County, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that McCormick County, SC is not east of Manatee
        County, FL. This is a direct comparative answer without any caveats about
        inability to determine or verify.

        equal in longitude. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Mississippi County is "directly south" of Dunklin County. The response
        describes their relative positions but does not explicitly state equality
        as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes that "Mississippi County, AR, is not located east

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the counties are in the same location. The model explicitly states that Hillsdale
        County is southwest of Gratiot County, indicating different positions. The
        NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Rather, the NO was given because Stafford County
        was described as being "northeast" rather than directly east of Richmond City,
        indicating a directional difference. The model explicitly notes this difference
        in relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice - once in the
        conclusion and once as a final standalone answer. The model provides a clear
        comparative result, indicating that Stafford County is not directly east of
        Richmond City (but rather northeast).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b11ade1f-812e-4b71-8afa-c97f58b2f173:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Stafford County
        is northwest of Richmond City, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes that "Stafford County is northwest of Richmond City,
        it is not east of Richmond City."
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        - that Stafford County is "northeast" of Richmond City, not directly east.
        This directional difference is given as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the conclusion and once as a final standalone answer. This is a
        definitive NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that Stafford County is north
        of Richmond City, indicating a clear directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        positions.

    cf43716a-340a-41ce-a752-9c28437cf8d2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Stafford County
        is "northeast of Richmond" and "not strictly east of Richmond". This directional
        difference, not equality, is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        conclusion stating "the answer is NO" and again as "Answer: NO". This is a

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal or
        the same. Instead, it explicitly notes that Metcalfe County is "southeast"
        relative to Bullitt County, and gives this directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer. Even though it's described as "slightly to the east", any
        stated difference means we cannot classify this as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        conclusion and once as the final answer. This is an explicit NO comparative
        result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's because Maricopa County is specifically
        described as being southeast of Yavapai County rather than directly east.
        The model identifies a directional difference between the counties.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Final Answer:
        NO" as its comparative conclusion, based on its analysis that Maricopa County
        is southeast (not directly east) of Yavapai County.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal/same
        - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Maricopa
        is "south and slightly east" of Yavapai). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result about the directional relationship between
        the counties.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Maricopa County is southeast of Yavapai County rather than directly east.
        The model explicitly notes a directional difference ("south and slightly east").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with clear directional reasoning explaining why Maricopa County is not directly
        east of Yavapai County (it's southeast instead).

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes differences in position, noting
        that Maricopa County is "south and slightly east" of Yavapai County, with
        some overlap. The NO answer is based on the fact that Maricopa is not fully
        east of Yavapai, not because they are in the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on the directional analysis provided.

        - instead, it specifically states that Maricopa County is "southeast" of Yavapai
        County and is "south and slightly east." Since it notes a directional difference
        (even if slight), this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Maricopa County is not east of Yavapai
        County.

        The NO answer was given because Lucas County is west (not east) of Claiborne
        County, not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative response to whether Lucas County is east of
        Claiborne County. The model explains that Lucas County is west of Claiborne
        County, making this a clear negative comparison.

        in east-west position is explicitly given as the basis for the negative comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that "Sheboygan County is not east of
        Ozaukee County."

    2872eae8-582c-4aeb-a9d4-6f67e7cdfa27:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Sheboygan
        County is "northwest of Ozaukee County" and "slightly northwest," indicating
        a directional difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a definitive comparative conclusion that "Sheboygan County is not east
        of Ozaukee County."

      result: 'NO'
    2f11acba-667c-42da-bc19-d292b230ad2c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same longitude or equally east/west. Instead, it states they are "aligned
        roughly north-south" but gives directional information ("not significantly
        east or west"). Since it notes there is some directional difference (even
        if slight) and bases the NO answer primarily on Sheboygan being "primarily
        north" rather than east, this does not qualify as equal values being the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" and
        clearly indicates that Sheboygan County is not east of Ozaukee County'

    a738ad36-0c7c-4bdb-810b-83a6eb8e6d86:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same longitude or in the same position. Instead, it explains that they
        are aligned vertically with Sheboygan County being north of Ozaukee County.
        The NO answer is based on their different positions (one being north of the
        other), not on them being in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the counties.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are in
        the same location or have equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Sheboygan County is north of Ozaukee County, indicating a clear directional
        difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the counties.

    d4820efb-e530-4560-ac52-ca5a669bce45:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both counties are aligned
        along the western shore of Lake Michigan, it does not state they are at the
        same longitude or equally east/west. The NO answer is given because Sheboygan
        is north of Ozaukee, not because they are at equal longitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that Sheboygan County is not located east of Ozaukee County.
        This is a direct comparative answer without any caveats about inability to
        determine or equality.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d4e36fae-353d-415e-9c13-d9ac32506db8:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same longitude or equally east/west. Instead, it notes they are "aligned
        roughly north-south" but specifically states that Sheboygan is "not significantly
        east or west" of Ozaukee, implying there might be slight differences. The
        NO answer is primarily based on Sheboygan being "primarily north" rather than
        east of Ozaukee.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that "Sheboygan County is not east of
        Ozaukee County."

        difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        states that San Juan County is "slightly west" of Musselshell County's longitude,
        indicating a difference in values (even if small) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
