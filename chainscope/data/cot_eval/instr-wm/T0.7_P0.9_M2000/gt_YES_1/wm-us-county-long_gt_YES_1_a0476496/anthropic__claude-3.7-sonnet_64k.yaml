      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model concludes that "Geary County,
        KS is east of Dallas County, TX" after comparing their longitudes.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it states that "Dallas County
        actually extends slightly further east" and notes that "Dallas County's eastern
        boundary extends slightly further east than Geary County's eastern boundary."
        The model acknowledges they are at "very similar longitudes" but identifies
        a difference (Dallas County extending further east), which is the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The answer is explicitly stated as "# Answer: NO" followed

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that George County has "a more
        easterly longitude than Kemper County" and that the southeastern portion of
        Mississippi "extends further east" than the east-central portion. The model
        is clearly indicating a difference in eastward position, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same longitude or equal in position as the reason for its NO answer. Instead,
        it suggests that George County might actually be slightly further east due
        to the curvature of Mississippi's eastern border. In step 6, it states "Kemper
        County, while also on the eastern border, is not further east than George
        County. If anything, due to the slight curvature of Mississippi's eastern
        border, George County likely extends slightly further east than Kemper County."
        This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        at approximately the same longitude or George County is slightly east of Kemper
        County." This indicates a potential slight difference rather than equality,
        and the model is saying NO because George County might be slightly east of

        location or have equal values. Instead, it explains that George County is
        actually east of Kemper County due to the northwest-to-southeast orientation
        of Mississippi's eastern border. The model specifically states "George County
        is actually east of Kemper County, not the other way around" as the reason
        for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal as the reason for its NO answer. While it mentions they are at "similar
        longitude," it also states San Juan County is "at a similar longitude or slightly
        west of" Musselshell County, indicating a difference rather than equality.
        The model is suggesting San Juan County is either at roughly the same longitude
        OR slightly west, not that they are exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model explicitly says "San Juan County, NM is not located east of Musselshell

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Musselshell County,
        MT is east of San Juan County, NM (not that they have the same longitude).
        The model specifically notes that "Musselshell County, MT has a slightly lower
        west longitude than San Juan County, NM, Musselshell County is actually east
        of San Juan County" and "San Juan County, NM is west of Musselshell County,
        MT - not east of it." The model is indicating a directional difference, not
        equality.
