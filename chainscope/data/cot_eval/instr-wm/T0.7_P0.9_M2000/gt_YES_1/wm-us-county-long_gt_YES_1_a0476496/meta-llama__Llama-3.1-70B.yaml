      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitudes. Instead, it explicitly states that Geary County is west
        of Dallas County ("Given that Geary County is west of Dallas County"). The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, after explaining why Geary County is west
        (not east) of Dallas County.'

      result: 'NO'
    17badd98-3a99-465b-ad3b-bd34fc7f27f7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or equally east/west. Instead, it explains that the relationship
        is primarily north-south and "not necessarily east or west," but does not
        claim they are at equal longitude. The NO answer appears to be based on rejecting
        the premise of an eastern position rather than on equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify
        the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model states that \"both counties have approximately\
        \ the same longitude\" (96.75\xB0W) and uses this equality as the primary\
        \ reason for its NO answer. While it adds \"or slightly east\" as a possibility,\
        \ this is presented as an uncertainty rather than a definitive difference,\
        \ and the main reasoning is based on their approximately equal longitudes."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Geary County is east of Dallas County.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the NO was because it determined Tyrrell
        County is south of Schuylkill County, not east of it. The model described
        a directional difference (south vs. north) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question about whether Tyrrell County is east
        of Schuylkill County.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the counties are in the same location. The model explicitly states that Conejos
        County is likely located west of Chaffee County, indicating a difference in
        location. The NO answer was given because of this directional difference,
        not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Conejos County is east of Chaffee County. The answer
        is given directly and definitively without qualifications about uncertainty
        or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there are differences in position,
        noting that Athens County is "north and slightly west" of McDowell County.
        The NO answer is based on directional differences, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, after analyzing the relative positions of the two counties.
        The answer is clearly stated and is a direct response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both counties have "similar
        estimated longitudes," it explicitly states that "McDowell County might be
        slightly east of Athens County." Since it identifies a directional difference
        (even if described as slight), this is not a case where the NO answer was
        given because the locations are exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it states that Cape May County is "generally west of
        Hunterdon County" - indicating a difference in position, even if its reasoning
        about north/south position seems flawed. The NO answer is based on this perceived
        westward position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Cape May County is east of Hunterdon County.

        noting that "Hunterdon County is... slightly west of it [Cape May County]".
        This difference, even though described as "slight", means the NO answer was
        not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions
        (Haakon County in western SD, Ward County in central ND) and gives a directional
        difference as the reason for the NO answer ("any part of South Dakota would
        generally be west of any part of North Dakota").

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Haakon County being west of Ward County), not because the locations are at
        the same longitude. The model explicitly states that South Dakota is west
        of North Dakota and uses this to conclude Haakon County must be west of Ward
        County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the counties are at the
        same longitude. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with Jackson County being "more central and to the northeast of McDonald County"
        and that moving between them "involves moving westward." The NO answer is
        based on directional differences, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Rutherford County is located WEST of Breckinridge County, indicating
        a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it states there's "no significant east-west
        difference" but primarily bases its NO answer on the south-north relationship.
        The mention of no significant difference is not the same as stating they are
        equal, and it's not given as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and clearly
        states this as its comparative answer regarding whether Foard County is east
        of Kidder County.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating Foard County is "west and south of Kidder County"), not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly indicates there is a geographical
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical
        analysis that Foard County is "west and south of Kidder County."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that Menominee
        County is "north of" Vanderburgh County, indicating different positions. The
        NO is based on directional difference (being north rather than east), not
        equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the explanation and once as a standalone answer at the end. The
        model provides a definitive comparative answer about the relative positions.

        the difference is described as "slight," any stated difference means this
        is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis, concluding that Menominee County is "north
        and slightly west of Vanderburgh County."

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Clallam County is "west or
        slightly west" of Coos County, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        equal longitudes. Instead, it explains that Clallam County is not east of
        Coos County because of their north-south orientation, implying different positions.
        The NO answer is based on relative positioning, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions "similar or nearly identical
        longitudes," it doesn't explicitly state they are exactly equal. The response
        suggests difficulty in determining relative positions due to similar longitudes,
        but doesn't claim equality as the reason for the NO answer. The phrase "similar
        or nearly identical" implies there could be some difference, even if small.

        that the locations were at the same longitude or equally east/west of each
        other. Instead, it described their relative positions differently (northwestern
        WA vs southwestern OR) and based its NO answer on their geographical relationship,
        not on them being at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer about whether Clallam County is east of Coos County. The
        answer was definitive and not qualified with uncertainty or inability to determine.

        - in fact, it explicitly states that "Clallam County being more westward than
        Coos County." The NO answer is given because Clallam is west of, not east
        of, Coos County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        NO answer is based on Mackinac being west of Kalkaska, not on them being at
        the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Mackinac County is "located to the west or northwest of Kalkaska County" -
        indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions that the counties have "similar
        longitudes," it does not explicitly state they are exactly equal or identical.
        In fact, it describes the east-west relationship as "less clear-cut" rather
        than equal. The NO appears to be based on uncertainty about the comparison
        rather than on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though earlier it expressed uncertainty about the exact longitudes.
        Since it gave a clear NO as its comparative conclusion, we classify this as
        NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions without exact longitude data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" but indicates
        it cannot determine the answer due to lacking longitude data. Since the model
        states it cannot make the determination, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Conecuh County is west of
        Santa Rosa County, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Conecuh County is east of Santa Rosa County. The answer
        is definitive and comparative.

        Winona County is west of Washburn County, not because the locations are equal.
        It explicitly states "Winona County is not only west of Washburn County but
        also south of it." Since it identifies a directional difference (west), this
        cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Winona County is east of Washburn County. The answer

        it explicitly states that Winona County is "west or slightly west of Washburn
        County." Even though the difference might be small ("slightly west"), any
        stated directional difference means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a directional explanation that Winona County is west/slightly

        same location. The model explicitly states a directional difference ("Rawlins
        County (in northwestern Kansas) would be directly west of Cherry County").
        Since the NO is based on a directional difference rather than equality, this
        is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly
        states "the answer to whether Rawlins County is located east of Cherry County,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Lea
        County is "slightly west" of Slope County, not because the locations are at
        the same longitude. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (westward position), even if described as "slight"
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion about the relative positions (stating
        Lea County is "south and slightly west of Slope County" and therefore not
        east of it)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Lea County would
        be west of Slope County ("New Mexico is to the west of North Dakota. So, any
        location in New Mexico (like Lea County) would be west of any location in
        North Dakota (like Slope County)"). The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Lea County is east of Slope County. This is a direct

        not state that the counties are at the same longitude or equally east/west
        of each other. Instead, it explains that Scotland County is south of Moore
        County, not east. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that Magoffin County
        is west of Oglethorpe County, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        answer was given because one location was west of the other, not because they
        were at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Magoffin
        County is "northwest of Oglethorpe County" and "further west and slightly
        north" - indicating a difference in location, not equality. The model does
        not state the locations are the same or equal.

      result: 'YES'
    84045ac5-e200-444d-a5bc-dcd37cf0647a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explains that while the counties have
        a north-south relationship, their east-west positioning is not definitively
        established. The NO comes from uncertainty about relative positions, not from
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        or the same. Instead, it explains that they are in different relative positions
        (one southern, one central) and that they are "not directly east or west of
        each other." The NO answer is based on their relative positions being different,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Terry County, TX is located east of Garden County, NE. This
        is a clear comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that their east-west positions
        are "relatively close," it does not explicitly state they are exactly equal
        or the same. The model describes them both as being in the western parts of
        their respective states, but never claims they have identical positions. Additionally,
        this relative closeness is not given as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    d0eedf21-fad7-4819-9adc-dbfdd489c682:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Terry
        County is west of Garden County, not because the locations are equal. The
        model explicitly describes a difference in position, stating "Terry County,
        TX, is west of Garden County, NE."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Terry County, TX is west of
        Garden County, NE (not east as asked in the question).

        longitude/position. Instead, it explicitly notes that Terry County is "slightly
        west or directly west" of Garden County, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on this westward position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        and explains that Terry County is "south and slightly west or directly west
        of Garden County" leading to a negative answer about Terry County being east
        of Garden County.

        locations are equal. The model explicitly states that Monongalia County is
        "slightly west of Salem City," indicating a difference in position. The NO
        answer is based on this westward position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        and explains that Monongalia County is "slightly west of Salem City," providing
        a definitive negative comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Monongalia County
        would be west of Salem City due to their relative positions in their respective
        states. The model indicates a directional difference (west vs east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Monongalia County, WV is located east of Salem City,
        VA. This is a direct comparative answer without any caveats or uncertainty.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Monongalia County is "west
        or slightly west and definitely north of Salem City" and gives this directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical analysis that
        Monongalia County is west of Salem City.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Monongalia
        County is northwest of Salem City, not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        describing Gunnison County as being "north and slightly west of Archuleta
        County." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        that the locations were equal or identical. In fact, it explicitly states
        that "Gunnison County being slightly to the north and east of Archuleta County."
        The presence of any directional difference, even if described as "slight,"
        means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Gunnison County is located east of Archuleta County. This
        is a clear comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a directional difference, saying Michigan (where Manistee County is) is
        "to the west of Alabama" (where Etowah County is). The NO appears to be based
        on this perceived directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Etowah County is NOT east
        of Manistee County (though this appears to be incorrect, the actual accuracy
        is not relevant for our classification).

        north and slightly west." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        noting that Etowah County is "significantly south and slightly west of Manistee
        County." Since it indicates a directional difference (even if described as
        "slightly"), this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        would be west of Etowah County, indicating a difference in position rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        close" in east-west alignment but provides the NO answer because Sully County
        "is not significantly east" and is "more north than east." This indicates
        a comparison of different (though similar) values, not equal ones.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude. Instead, it notes that "Caddo Parish might be slightly east
        or west of Faribault County, depending on their exact longitudes" and bases
        its NO answer on the fact that Caddo Parish is south of Faribault County,
        not on them being at equal longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Caddo Parish is located east of Faribault County. This is a direct
        comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        or same longitude values. Instead, it notes there's "significant overlap"
        in longitude ranges and expresses uncertainty about precise positions, but
        ultimately gives a NO answer without explicitly stating the locations are
        at the same longitude.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it gives the reason that Caddo Parish
        has a "general southward position relative to Faribault County." The model
        never states that the locations are at the same longitude or equally east/west
        of each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        and provides reasoning leading to that negative answer regarding whether Caddo
        Parish is east of Faribault County.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Mississippi
        County is west of Dunklin County, not because the locations are equal/same/identical.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference (west vs east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        and explains that Mississippi County is west of Dunklin County (not east as
        asked in the question), making this a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same longitude or equally east/west. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Mississippi County is "south or southeast of Dunklin County" - indicating
        there is a difference in position, even if slight. The NO answer is based
        on relative positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the counties.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying Burke County is "to the northwest of Saluda County" and Saluda County
        is "east of Burke County." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Burke County, NC is located east of Saluda County,
        SC. The answer is given directly and definitively.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same longitude or that they are equal in position. Instead, it explains
        that both counties are in the western parts of their respective states and
        that movement between them would be primarily southward. The NO answer is
        based on directional reasoning rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" as a direct comparative result, indicating that Burke County,
        NC is not located east of Saluda County, SC.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the counties are "not significantly
        east or west of each other," it does not explicitly state they are equal or
        identical in position. In fact, it discusses relative positions and mentions
        differences in location, even noting that North Carolina is "slightly east"
        of South Carolina. The NO answer appears to be based on these relative positions
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether Burke County is east of Saluda County. This
        is a clear negative response to the comparison question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer, explaining
        that Hardeman County is unlikely to be east of Ballard County due to their
        relative positions in their respective states. The NO is based on a difference
        in position, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they are "approximately at
        the same longitude," it also states that Hardeman County would be "slightly
        west" of Ballard County. Since it indicates a directional difference (even
        if slight), this does not qualify as stating the locations are exactly equal
        as the primary reason for the NO answer.

        equal or the same. Instead, it specifically states that Hardeman County is
        "south or slightly west and definitely west of Ballard County." Since it describes
        a directional difference (even if slight), this is not a case of equal values
        being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion about the relative positions of
        the counties. The answer is explicitly stated and relates to the geographical
        comparison being asked about.

        that while one is south of the other, they are "not necessarily east or west
        of it." This is not the same as stating they are at equal longitude, and the
        NO is not based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that "Chittenden County, being
        in the northwestern part of Vermont, is slightly west of Rutland County."
        This indicates a difference in position, even though described as "slight,"
        which means the NO answer was not based on equal values.

        they are both in the western part of Vermont but describes them as "not significantly
        different" in east-west positioning, which implies some difference exists.
        The NO answer is based on their relative positions, not on them being exactly
        equal.

        or the same in terms of east-west position. Instead, it concludes NO because
        Rutland County is "located to the south of Chittenden County" rather than
        east. Since the NO answer is based on a different spatial relationship (south)
        rather than equality, this is False.

        of Yavapai County rather than east of it. The model did not base its NO answer
        on equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        their relative positions as "south-central" vs "north" of each other, focusing
        on their north-south relationship rather than stating they are at equal longitude.
        The NO answer appears to be based on their relative positions, not because
        they are at the same longitude.

        that the locations have equal longitude or are at the same position east-west.
        Instead, it concluded NO based on reasoning that Custer County is "south or
        southwest" of Hand County. Since the model indicates a directional difference
        (even if slight), this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its determination
        that Rooks County, KS is west of Webb County, TX - indicating a directional
        difference between the locations. The model does not state or suggest the
        locations are at the same longitude or otherwise equal in position. The NO
        is based on a determined difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Rooks County, KS is located east of Webb County, TX.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Rooks County is
        "north and slightly east or more north than east of Webb County." Since it
        identifies a directional difference (even if slight), this is not a case of
        equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Amherst County is west of Lynchburg City), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, with one being west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the locations, indicating
        that Amherst County is west of (not east of) Lynchburg City.

        that the locations were at the same position. Instead, it explicitly stated
        that "Lynchburg City is slightly east of Amherst County," indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the locations, indicating

        Instead, it specifically states that Shiawassee County is "north and slightly
        east of Clermont County" - noting a directional difference. The NO answer
        is based on this directional relationship, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        in fact, it explicitly stated that "Shiawassee County, MI, is located slightly
        west of Clermont County, OH." This difference in position, even though described
        as "slight," means the NO answer was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after analyzing
        the relative positions and determining that Shiawassee County is slightly

        that "Shiawassee County, MI, would be west of Clermont County, OH." The NO
        answer is based on a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its answer, it does not
        state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that
        Trimble County is not east of Chattooga County due to their relative positions,
        with Georgia being southeast of Kentucky. The NO answer is based on directional
        differences, not equality.
