      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - specifically stating
        that "Festus would be positioned southeast of Sunset Hills, meaning Festus
        is actually east of Sunset Hills, not the other way around." The model is
        indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Sunset Hills, MO is located east of Festus, MO. The model explicitly
        concludes with "NO" at the end of its response after explaining that "Festus
        is actually east of Sunset Hills, not the other way around."

        In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in the locations, stating "Festus
        has a slightly smaller western longitude value than Sunset Hills" and "Festus
        is positioned slightly further east." The model concludes that "Sunset Hills
        is actually slightly west of Festus." Since the model identifies a difference
        (even if described as "slight"), this is not a case where the NO answer is
        based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Sunset Hills is NOT
        located east of Festus" as its final answer to the comparative question. This
        is an explicit NO response.

        western MD" but then contradicts this with a "NO" answer. Despite this contradiction,
        the model does not claim the locations have equal longitude or are at the
        same position. It's stating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model directly answers the question "Is Butner,
        NC located east of Bowmans Addition, MD?" with "NO" after its step-by-step

        The model's reasoning is that "Northwestern Illinois is west of southwestern
        Illinois" and since Lanark is in the northwest and Hamel is in the southwest,
        Lanark must be west of Hamel.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

        being compared are the same. Instead, the model stated that Lanark is west
        of Hamel, indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The
        model's reasoning was that "Lanark, being in northwestern Illinois, lies to
        the west of Hamel, which is in southwestern Illinois" and "Since Lanark is
        west of Hamel, it cannot be east of Hamel." This clearly indicates a difference
        in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Lanark is east of Hamel. The model explicitly concludes

        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Lanark is east of Hamel. The model concludes that

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Sully is NOT east of Lindstrom
        because "Sully is in central Iowa, which would place it west of Lindstrom's
        longitude." The model is indicating a directional difference (Sully being
        west, not east, of Lindstrom), not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Sully, IA is located east of Lindstrom, MN. The answer is explicitly

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, it states "Hancock is very
        slightly west of Ixonia by a small fraction of a degree" and "with Ixonia
        being very slightly east of Hancock." This indicates a difference in values,
        even if described as slight. The model is saying NO because Ixonia is slightly
        east (not west) of Hancock, not because they are at exactly the same longitude
        (though it does note they are "at almost identical longitudes" and "at nearly
        identical longitudes").

        (slightly west), even if tiny, which means it's not claiming equality as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Ixonia, WI is not located east of Hancock, MI. This

      explanation_equal_values: "The model did not give a NO answer because the values\

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the question of whether Eugene,
        Oregon is east of Hayfork, California. However, this appears to be a mistake,
        as the model's reasoning actually concludes that Eugene IS east of Hayfork
        (stating "Eugene is slightly east of Hayfork" in its explanation). Despite
        this contradiction, I must classify based on the explicit final answer provided,
        which is "NO".

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Fortville is west
        of Red Boiling Springs, indicating a directional difference. The model's reasoning
        for the NO answer is that Fortville is in Indiana, which is west of Tennessee
        where Red Boiling Springs is located.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question "Is Fortville, IN located east of Red Boiling

        between the two locations. The model gives a clear reason for its NO answer
        - that one location is west of the other, not that they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Fortville, IN is located east of Red Boiling Springs, TN. The answer

        slightly west of Red Boiling Springs, TN" as the reason for its NO answer.
        Although it mentions they are "very close in terms of east-west positioning,"
        it still identifies a directional difference (slightly west), which means
        it's not claiming equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Fortville, IN is not located east of Red Boiling

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states differences in their
        positions: "Sandy Hook is actually slightly east of Bantam" and "Bantam is
        positioned more westward in the state than Sandy Hook." The model is giving
        NO because it believes Sandy Hook is east of Bantam (not that they''re in
        the same location).'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Bantam, CT is east of Sandy Hook, CT. The answer
        is clearly stated at the end of the response after the reasoning section.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the model's final answer was YES, not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response after analyzing the longitudes of Bantam, CT and Sandy Hook, CT.
        The model concludes that "Bantam is located slightly east of Sandy Hook" and
        provides a clear "YES" as its final answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
