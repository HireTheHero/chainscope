      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared

        for the NO answer, stating that "Garnavillo would be northwest of Newellton"
        and "Given that Garnavillo is north of Newellton, it would not be east of
        Newellton." The model is indicating a specific directional difference (northwest

        Creek is on the western side of Florida and Conestee is on the western side
        of South Carolina, concluding that Pebble Creek is not east of Conestee. The

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes Manahawkin,
        NJ is south of Paul Smiths, NY, not east of it. The model states "it is not
        located east of Paul Smiths, NY. Instead, it is located south of Paul Smiths,
        NY." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
