      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Garnavillo is west of Newellton, not because the locations are at the same
        position. It explicitly states "Garnavillo is west of Newellton" as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, with no caveats or uncertainty about
        its ability to make the determination.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    0e1e5caa-2097-42c5-bee1-4d9046f47106:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Garnavillo was determined to be northwest of Newellton, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical comparison
        showing Garnavillo is northwest of Newellton (and thus not east of it).'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that Garnavillo is west
        of Newellton, indicating a difference in position. The NO is based on Garnavillo
        being west rather than east of Newellton.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response about
        the relative position of the two locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Rocksprings
        is southwest of Aspermont, indicating a directional difference. It does not
        state that the locations are equal or the same in any way. The NO is due to
        the directional difference, not due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 7 and once as a final standalone answer. The model gives a
        clear directional reason (Natalia being west, not east) for this answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and "does not have enough information to answer this question"
        due to lacking precise location data. This indicates an inability to make
        the comparison rather than a refusal or definitive answer.

        based on this directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because Sully is
        west of Lindstrom, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly states
        there is a directional difference ("Sully is west of Lindstrom"), so even
        though this might be a small difference, any stated difference means we must
        classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the conclusion and once as a final standalone answer. This is a
        definitive comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Sully is "further
        south and west compared to Lindstrom" and concludes NO because Sully is west,
        not east, of Lindstrom.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was because Sully
        was determined to be west of Lindstrom (showing a difference in position),
        rather than east as presumably asked in the original question.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Freedom
        is west of Antioch (not east), indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. It does not state the locations are equal or the same in any
        way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Freedom is west of Antioch,
        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations as the reason
        for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Freedom
        is west of Antioch, not because the locations are at the same position. The
        model explicitly notes a difference in their positions, with Freedom being
        "west of Antioch."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that "Freedom is actually west of Antioch" - indicating a difference in position
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        as its final answer, indicating that Freedom is not east of Antioch. This
        is a direct comparative answer without any caveats about inability to determine
        or equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        Freedom is west of Antioch, indicating a directional difference between their
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Freedom is west of Antioch (not east as asked in the
        question). This is a direct comparative answer.

    b5406569-66b2-49f9-a726-f6bbefe495df:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Freedom is west
        of Antioch (and Antioch is east of Freedom), indicating a clear directional
        difference between their positions. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" and "NO, Freedom, CA is NOT located east of Antioch, CA." This is a
        definitive NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Freedom
        is west of Antioch (specifically stating "Freedom is west of Antioch"), not
        because the locations are equal. The model explicitly describes a directional
        difference between the locations, with one being west and one being east of
        the coastal mountain range.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Freedom was determined to be west of Antioch, indicating a difference in location.
        The model explicitly states "Freedom is west of Antioch, not east of it" as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, based on its determination that Freedom is west of Antioch,
        not east of it. This is a direct comparative answer to the question asked.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined Freedom is west of Antioch (a directional difference),
        not east as asked in the question. Any directional difference, even if slight,
        means this is not an equality case.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        positions. The answer is definitive and based on a specific directional comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Elmwood was explicitly stated to be west of Crenshaw, indicating a difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
