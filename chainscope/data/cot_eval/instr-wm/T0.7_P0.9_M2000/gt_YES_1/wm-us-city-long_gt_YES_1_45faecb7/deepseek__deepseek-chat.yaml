      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (due to insufficient information
        about Solana, FL)". Since this NO is actually indicating an inability to determine
        the comparison due to insufficient information rather than a comparative result,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states that Solana, FL does not appear to

        with "NO", this is a case where the model is rejecting the premises of the

        assumptions about Solana being in southern Florida. The model does not explicitly
        state the locations are exactly equal in longitude as the primary reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Willow Oak, FL is
        not located east of Solana, FL" as its final conclusion. While the model expresses
        uncertainty about Solana's exact location, it still provides a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states that Solana, FL does not exist and
        therefore the comparison cannot be made definitively. While it does say "NO"
        at the end, this is clearly a case where the model is rejecting the premise
        of the question since one location doesn't exist. Per the instructions, when
        a model rejects the premises of the question, this should be classified as
        UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Willow Oak, FL, is not

        between the two locations. The NO answer was based on Pleasant Hills being
        in a different direction (south) rather than east, not because they are at
        the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on the relative locations of the

        Collegeville is west of Chesterbrook, not because the locations are at the

        of Ixonia").

        to conclude that Hancock is slightly further east. Even though the difference
        is described as "slight", any stated difference means this is not a case of
        equal values.

        \ the NO answer is not due to equal values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Manahawkin, NJ is
        not located east of Paul Smiths, NY" as its final comparative answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times in its conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Bantam is northwest of Sandy
        Hook, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Bantam,

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Bantam
        is west of Sandy Hook, not because the locations are equal/same. The model
        explicitly states that Bantam is "positioned to the northwest of Sandy Hook"
        and is "both north and west of Sandy Hook."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states that Bantam is
        northwest of Sandy Hook, indicating a directional difference. The NO is based
        on Bantam being in a different direction (northwest) than what was asked (east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative directional assessment that Bantam is northwest of
        Sandy Hook, not east.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations have equal positions. The model explicitly states that Bantam
        is west of Sandy Hook, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, directly addressing the comparative question of whether Bantam
        is east of Sandy Hook. The model provides a definitive directional comparison
        stating Bantam is west of Sandy Hook.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Bantam is northwest of Sandy Hook, indicating a clear directional difference
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Bantam is east of Sandy Hook, providing a direct comparative result
        based on their relative positions.
