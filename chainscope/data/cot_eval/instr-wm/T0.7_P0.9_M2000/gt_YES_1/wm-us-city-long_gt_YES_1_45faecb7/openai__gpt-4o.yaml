      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or position. Instead, it indicates that Freedom is not
        east of Antioch because of their relative positions (with Antioch being more
        inland/eastward and Freedom being closer to the coast). The NO answer is based
        on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, saying Letha is "north and slightly west of Caldwell."
        Any stated directional difference, even if described as "slight," means this
        is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        explains that Letha is "north and slightly west of Caldwell" rather than east

        of the Hudson River but describes their positions as "neither is significantly
        east or west of the other." This suggests a comparison was made and found
        them to be similar but not exactly equal. The NO answer appears to be based

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it's because one location is northeast of the other, indicating
        a directional difference. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (northeast vs the asked-about east direction).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that Clifton Knolls-Mill Creek is not directly

        saying Clifton Knolls-Mill Creek is "north and slightly west" of Sleepy Hollow
        Lake. Even though the difference might be slight, any stated directional difference
        means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
