        of equal values is not relevant since there was no final NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and cuts off
        mid-thought. While there is some indication of leaning towards certain conclusions
        at different points (including a tentative "YES" in one part), there is no
        clear final answer given. The response ends abruptly while still analyzing

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. While it discusses various coordinates and at one point mentions
        "2-minute difference", its final conclusion is based on Rocksprings being
        "further west in longitude" than Aspermont. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference (southwest vs north-central) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a definitive
        comparative conclusion that Rocksprings is not east of Aspermont, explaining
        it is southwest of Aspermont instead.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        were equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for
        NO answers.

    34a9fbfe-1a28-4c54-9bad-22058aa08fc5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did discuss equal or similar longitudes at points but never reached a final
        NO conclusion based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends with "But" and never reaches a final
        conclusion. While it explores various possibilities (including both YES and
        NO at different points), it does not provide a definitive answer. The model
        appears to be still thinking through the problem when the response ends.

        \ a longitude of approximately -100.2\xB0, it immediately clarifies that \"\
        Rocksprings is slightly further west due to its position relative to major\

        \ and this difference is the basis for the NO answer, rather than equality\
        \ being the reason, this should be classified as False."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Rocksprings is west of Aspermont, not east.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a final NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-thought without providing a
        clear final answer. While the model considers multiple possibilities and at
        one point says "YES, Rocksprings is east of Aspermont", it continues to question
        this conclusion and ends without resolving the comparison definitively.

        automatically receives a False classification per the instructions, regardless
        of any comparisons made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation ending with "the answer is YES" based on
        comparing the longitudes of the two locations.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal/same values question
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear final answer stating "YES, Rocksprings, TX is located east of Aspermont,

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        were equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for
        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation leading to this answer, including coordinates
        and reasoning for why Rocksprings is east of Aspermont.

        \ with Rocksprings being at ~100.2\xB0W and Aspermont at ~100.0\xB0W. The\
        \ NO answer is based on this difference in position, not on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that Rocksprings is not east of Aspermont.
        The answer is clearly stated and provides a specific directional comparison.

        W and Plentywood at 104.1 W, indicating different values, with Plentywood
        being east of Keenesburg. The NO answer is based on this difference in values,

      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through several iterations of reasoning
        but ultimately concludes with "NO" in its final analysis, stating "Therefore,
        Keenesburg is west of Plentywood, so the answer is NO." While there is some

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-analysis
        without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion. While the model was working through

        for the location of "The Homesteads, TX" and concludes that without knowing
        its exact location, it cannot determine the answer. The response ends without
        making a definitive comparative statement.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    83c42a33-1b8a-4dfa-9ba1-234d0cff63ed:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate if equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a definitive YES/NO conclusion.
        While it explores various possibilities and coordinates, it ends mid-thought
        without making a final comparative statement. The response shows uncertainty
        about the exact location of The Homesteads, TX and considers multiple possibilities
        without settling on an answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    beb2abec-f0c0-4d9a-98dc-f5c84dbf397e:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer, so the question of whether values are
        equal is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        never reaches a definitive conclusion. While it considers multiple scenarios
        and seems to lean towards "yes" at points, it continues to present alternatives
        and never makes a clear final determination. The response ends abruptly while
        still analyzing possibilities.

        while still analyzing the locations. The model never reaches a final YES/NO
        conclusion about whether Union Mill, VA is east of Sneads Ferry, NC. While
        it provides some coordinates and analysis, it doesn't make a definitive comparative

        immediately follows with alternatives ("But if Union Mill is in a different

        those were based on relative positions, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never actually
        provides a final YES/NO answer. The model gets caught in circular reasoning,
        contradicting itself multiple times, and ends mid-thought while still trying
        to figure out the relative positions. Without a clear conclusion, this falls
        under UNKNOWN.

        \ a clear comparative answer stating that Bantam is east of Sandy Hook, supported\
        \ by longitude coordinates showing Bantam at 73.23\xB0W is east of Sandy Hook\
        \ at 73.28\xB0W."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" and confirmed that
        Bantam is east of Sandy Hook, providing specific longitude coordinates and
        explaining its reasoning.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and reinforced
        this with a final statement explaining that Bantam is east of Sandy Hook due
        to its less westerly longitude.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality when the answer
        is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES" and states
        "Therefore, **YES**, Bantam, CT is located east of Sandy Hook, CT." The answer
        is clearly affirmative and directly addresses the comparison.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
