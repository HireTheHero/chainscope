        The reason for the NO answer is that the buildings have different geographical
        positions (west vs. north), not that they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion section. The model determines that the Post & Echo Building

        difference in their locations. The model's reasoning is that "Makati City
        (where Centennial Tower is) is located south of Manila city proper" and therefore
        "Centennial Tower is south of Central United Methodist Church, not north of
        it."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it specifically states that RM Williams Way
        is located south of the school, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the two locations. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based
        on this directional difference (south vs. north), not on any equality between
        the locations.

        that RM Williams Way would be south of Cherrybrook Technology High School,
        not north. The model's reasoning is based on geographical locations (South
        Australia being south of New South Wales), not on equality of values.

        Park (southwest Sydney) while Cherrybrook Technology High School is in Cherrybrook
        (northwest Sydney). The model specifically states that "RM Williams Way cannot
        be north of Cherrybrook Technology High School" because Oran Park is south
        of Cherrybrook. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that RM Williams Way
        is located south of Cherrybrook Technology High School, indicating a directional
        difference between the two locations. The reason for the NO answer is this
        directional difference (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, RM Williams Way is not
        located north of Cherrybrook Technology High School. It is located south of

        rather than equality.

        question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a clear "YES" answer at the end
        of its response. After reasoning through various possibilities for what "Pearl
        Palace" might refer to, it concludes that the most historically significant
        Pearl Palace is likely Qasr al-Lu'lu' in Aleppo, Syria, which is north of
        Hotel Continental in Tangier.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Pearl Palace cannot be north
        of Hotel Continental due to the hotel's northern position within Tangier,
        with the Strait of Gibraltar to the north. The model is making a directional
        comparison, not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model concludes that Pearl Palace cannot
        be located north of Hotel Continental based on geographical reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it finds no evidence
        of a Pearl Palace located north of Hotel Continental, and notes that known
        "Pearl Palaces" elsewhere are all south of Tangier's latitude. The model is
        making a directional comparison, not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model concludes that Pearl Palace is
        not located north of Hotel Continental in Tangier.

        in their north-south positions. The model's reasoning is that Bushey is more
        directly north of London while Debden is more northeast, meaning there is
        a directional difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO. Debden tube station

        Town; it is actually located within Old Town itself, specifically on Market
        Square." This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f06f766d-5bb2-4d78-8fde-c55d1e14209f:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Black House is located
        within Old Town Lviv ("the Black House is not north of Old Town Lviv, but
        is actually located within Old Town itself"). This indicates a different spatial
        relationship (containment) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "# Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that the Black House is not north of Old Town
        Lviv.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reason for saying NO is not that the values
        being compared are equal. Rather, the model explains that the Black House
        is located within Old Town (specifically on Rynok Square, which is in the
        heart of Old Town), not north of it. The model is not claiming the locations
        are the same or equal - it's stating that one location (Black House) is contained
        within the other location (Old Town).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response.
        The model directly answers the question of whether Black House, Lviv is located
        north of Old Town (Lviv) with a definitive "NO" after explaining its reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Kings Langley Palace is "to
        the west and somewhat south of Blake Hall tube station," indicating a directional
        difference rather than equality. The model is stating that one location is
        in a different position relative to the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        suggests the Pierhead Building is slightly north of East Brixton railway station,
