        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Cathedral of
        St Bavo is north of the Ronde Lutherse Kerk because Haarlem (where the Cathedral
        is located) is slightly north of Amsterdam (where the Ronde Lutherse Kerk
        is located). The model is noting a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that RM Williams Way
        is positioned southwest of Cherrybrook Technology High School, indicating
        a directional difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference
        (southwest vs. north), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. Instead, it explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or
        NO answer to whether RM Williams Way is located north of Cherrybrook Technology
        High School" due to insufficient information about the location of RM Williams

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the relative positions due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot confirm
        that RM Williams Way is located north of Cherrybrook Technology High School
        based on the information available to me." This is not a definitive NO to
        the comparison itself, but rather an indication that the model cannot determine
        the answer due to lack of information. This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        as the model is stating it "cannot confirm" the relationship.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot give a definitive YES or NO answer" because it
        lacks sufficient information about RM Williams Way and its location relative
        to Cherrybrook Technology High School. This indicates the model recognizes
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient data.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Cherrybrook is located further north than the Oakhurst/Glendenning area
        where RM Williams Way is situated." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether RM Williams Way is located north of Cherrybrook Technology High
        School. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Jamestown (where RM Williams
        Way is) is south of Sydney (where Cherrybrook Technology High School is),
        indicating a difference in latitude. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether RM Williams Way is located north of Cherrybrook
        Technology High School. The model concludes that "Jamestown (where RM Williams
        Way is) is actually south of Sydney in terms of latitude, not north of it.
        Therefore, RM Williams Way is not north of Cherrybrook Technology High School."

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot provide a definitive YES
        or NO answer" and explains that it lacks the necessary geographical information
        to determine the relationship between RM Williams Way and Cherrybrook Technology
        High School. The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer, but rather
        indicates it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - it actually gave a YES answer after
        correcting its initial mistake.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer. The model recognized
        it made a mistake in its analysis and provided a clear correction at the end.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that "Lake Mulwala is located northwest
        of Hume Dam - not directly north but primarily westward with a slight northerly
        component." The model is noting a directional difference (northwest vs. north),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Lake Mulwala is
        not located north of Hume Dam." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what I classified as an UNKNOWN answer because it couldn't verify the existence
        or location of Pearl Palace.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confirm
        that Pearl Palace is located north of Hotel Continental in Tangier based on
        available information)". This is a case where the model is saying "NO" but
        is actually indicating it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information

        it couldn't make the comparison due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confirm
        this statement based on available information)". This is a case where the
        model is indicating it cannot determine or verify the comparison due to lack
        of information about one of the locations. The parenthetical explanation clarifies
        that the "NO" is not a comparative result but rather an inability to confirm.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same - it gave what appears to be a NO answer because it couldn't verify the
        location information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the explanation that follows indicates that the model cannot confirm
        the relationship because it lacks information about Old Moster Church's location.
        This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify" rather than
        making a comparative determination, so the final answer should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - I cannot confirm
        that Old Moster Church is located north of Lake Kubenskoye based on available
        information." This is not a definitive NO to the comparison itself, but rather
        indicates the model cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information
        about one of the locations. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the
        model is indicating it cannot make the comparison.

        or verify the comparison, not that the comparison is false. The model explicitly
        states "I don't have sufficient data to establish the church's location in
        relation to the lake." This indicates inability to make the comparison rather
        than a definitive comparative result.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" to the question
        of whether Aladdin Theater is north of Maison Alcan. The model initially gave
        a "NO" answer, then reconsidered and verified its answer, still concluding

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, it explicitly states that Montreal
        (where Maison Alcan is) is "slightly further north than Portland" and "slightly
        higher in latitude by about 0.1-0.2 degrees" than Portland (where Aladdin
        Theater is). The model is noting a difference in values, even if described
        as "slight," which means it's not claiming equality as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Aladdin Theater is
        not north of Maison Alcan; it's actually slightly south of it)" as its final
        answer. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, in its final point, it states "Montreal,
        Canada is north of Portland, Oregon in terms of latitude, and Maison Alcan
        would be north of Aladdin Theater." This indicates the model believes there
        is a difference in latitude (with Maison Alcan being further north), which
        is why it answered NO to whether Aladdin Theater is north of Maison Alcan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Aladdin Theater (Portland, Oregon) located north of Maison
        Alcan?" The answer is clear and direct.

        slightly further north than Portland" and concludes that "both locations are
        at very similar latitudes with Montreal typically being slightly further north."
        This indicates a difference in values (even if slight) rather than equality
        as the reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal. Instead, it notes that while the locations are "extremely close," Dallas
        is "actually slightly further north than Charleston by a very small margin."
        The model identifies a difference in position, even if very small, rather
        than stating the locations are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Emanuel African Methodist
        Episcopal Church is not located north of First Baptist Church in Dallas)"
        as its final answer. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values are exactly\
        \ equal as the reason for its NO answer. While it notes they have \"similar\
        \ latitudes\" at \"approximately 51.6\xB0N,\" it specifically states that\
        \ \"Swansea Bay is actually slightly southwest of London, not north of it.\"\
        \ This indicates a directional difference (southwest vs. north), not equality,\
        \ as the reason for the NO answer."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Tidal Lagoon Swansea
        Bay is not located north of Wood Green tube station" as its final answer.
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. The model provides a clear comparative answer after analyzing the
        locations of Tidal Lagoon Swansea Bay and Wood Green tube station.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it states that "Tidal Lagoon Swansea
        Bay is not located north of Wood Green tube station. It is west and slightly
        south of it." The model specifically notes that Swansea Bay is "slightly south"
        compared to Wood Green, indicating a difference in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Tidal Lagoon Swansea Bay is north of Wood Green tube station. The
        answer is explicitly stated at the end of the response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Swansea Bay is "located to the west and
        south of Wood Green tube station" and that "South Wales (including Swansea)
        is typically further south than North London." The model is indicating a difference
        in position (Swansea being south of Wood Green), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Tidal Lagoon Swansea
        Bay is not located north of Wood Green tube station." This is a clear negative
        comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it suggests that Swansea Bay
        is actually slightly south of Wood Green, stating "Swansea Bay specifically
        is slightly south of this" after noting approximate latitudes. The model indicates
        a directional difference (Swansea being south of Wood Green), not equality,
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to
        the question of whether Tidal Lagoon Swansea Bay is located north of Wood
        Green tube station.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a difference in position,
        saying that Tidal Lagoon Swansea Bay is "located to the west and slightly
        south of Wood Green tube station." Since the model notes a directional difference
        (even if described as "slightly south"), this is not a case where the NO answer
        is due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Tidal Lagoon Swansea Bay is located north of Wood Green tube station.
        The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response after concluding that "Swansea, despite being in western UK rather
        than eastern UK, is slightly further north in terms of latitude than Wood
        Green tube station in North London."
