      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Masmak Fort is "not in the
        immediate north of the lake, but rather far away" and is "in a completely
        different country and significantly west and north" of Fateh Sagar Lake. The
        NO answer is based on directional differences (the fort being northwest rather
        than directly north) and distance ("far away"), not on equality of values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "Riyadh (where Masmak Fort
        is located) is northwest of Udaipur (where Fateh Sagar Lake is located)".
        The model is noting a directional difference (northwest), not equality, as
        the reason for its NO answer.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that Masmak Fort is "northwest"
        and "significantly west" of Fateh Sagar Lake, indicating a directional difference.
        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on this directional difference
        (not being "directly north"), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" at the

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating

        south of Uttarakhand." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.

        that "Chandigarh is geographically southwest of Uttarakhand" and "the Palace
        of Assembly (which is in Chandigarh) is also south of Maneri Dam." The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference (south), not on equality of
        values.

        is also south of Maneri Dam." The NO answer is based on this directional difference
        (south), not on equality.

        this directional relationship, not on equality of values.

        NO. The reason for the NO is based on a directional difference, not equality
        of values.

        of Raozan Power Station. This directional difference is the reason for the

        answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of Raozan Power Station and Kaptai

        states a directional difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion section. The model determined that Little St Mary's is located
        south of OLEM, not north, and therefore answered NO to the question of whether
        Little St Mary's is north of OLEM.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference (Swansea being south
        of Wood Green), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Since Swansea is south of
        Wood Green, the answer is NO" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO
        in response to whether Tidal Lagoon Swansea Bay is north of Wood Green tube
        station.
