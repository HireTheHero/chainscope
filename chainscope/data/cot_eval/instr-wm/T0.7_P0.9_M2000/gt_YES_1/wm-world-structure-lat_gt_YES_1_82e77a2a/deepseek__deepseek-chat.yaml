      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating that Fitzroy Tavern is west of Burdett Road railway station), not
        because the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference between the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (west vs north), not because the locations are equal. The model
        explicitly states Green River Lake is west of Kenner Army Health Clinic.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal coordinates - instead, it explicitly states that Green River Lake is
        west of Kenner Army Health Clinic. The NO answer is based on a different directional
        relationship (west), not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Kentucky being southwest of Virginia), not because the locations are at the
        same coordinates. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Green River Lake is west of Kenner Army Health Clinic, indicating a difference
        in position as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying Green River Lake is "slightly south of Fort Lee" rather than north.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the conclusion and once as the final answer. This is a definitive
        comparative result.

        the locations were equal - the model explicitly states that Green River Lake
        is southwest of Kenner Army Health Clinic, indicating different positions.
        The NO answer was given because the relationship was southwest rather than
        north
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly states that the Futurist Theatre is south of the Stephen Joseph
        Theatre, not north of it. This is a clear comparative result.

        Even though they are in the same town, the model notes a specific directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        conclusion and once as the final answer. It makes a clear comparative statement
        that the Stephen Joseph Theatre is north of the Futurist Theatre, leading
        to its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states there is a directional difference, with
        Futurist Theatre being south of Stephen Joseph Theatre. The NO is because
        the relationship is opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Futurist Theatre is

        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that the Futurist Theatre
        is on the southern end while the Stephen Joseph Theatre is "further north,"
        indicating a clear difference in position. The NO answer was given because
        Futurist Theatre is south of (not equal to) Stephen Joseph Theatre.

        model never states that the locations are at the same latitude or otherwise
        equal in position.

        is different (east-west) rather than the proposed north-south relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its answer, it does not
        state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that they
        cannot be meaningfully compared due to being in different hemispheres. This
        is a different type of reasoning than saying the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it argues this is due to the locations not being in a comparable geographic
        relationship. Since the model gives a clear NO as its comparative result (rather
        than saying it cannot determine), this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. Rather, it stated the comparison "doesn't
        make sense" because they are on different continents. The model did not claim
        the locations are equal or the same - it actually emphasized they are in "entirely
        different parts of the world."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its conclusion, even though it also says the comparison doesn't make sense.
        Since there is an explicit NO statement as the final answer, we classify this
        as NO rather than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

        Castle being east of Kaibab Lake rather than north. The NO is based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        it doesn't base its NO answer on the locations being equal or the same. Instead,
        it explains that they are in different parts of the world and that a north-south
        relationship doesn't apply. This is a different reason than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it states they are on "entirely different
        continents and hemispheres" and that the comparison is not meaningful due
        to their geographic relationship. The NO is based on the premise being false,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its conclusion. While it explains that the comparison is not meaningful due
        to the locations being on different continents, it still provides a clear
        NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the conclusion and once as the final answer. This is a definitive

        for its NO answer, including that both locations are near the equator and
        that it's "not accurate to say that Istana Lama is definitively north." Since
        equality is not explicitly stated as the reason for the NO answer, this should
        be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its analysis, making this a clear NO response. While the model discusses

        rather than stating the locations are equal.

        the values being compared are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model gave

        separation. The model never states the locations are at the same latitude
        or otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it explains this is because the comparison is not meaningful due to
        geographical separation. Since this is a clear NO statement given as a comparative
        result (not a refusal or inability to determine), this should be classified

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Thevally Palace is explicitly stated to be southwest of the British Residency,
        indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Scarsdale Tavern is "slightly
        north of Brompton Oratory," indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Brompton Oratory
        is not located north of Scarsdale Tavern" as its final answer, and provides
        a clear comparative result indicating that Scarsdale Tavern is actually north
        of Brompton Oratory.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same/identical - it explicitly states that Ehrenburg Palace is south
        of Morizkirche and Morizkirche is "slightly to the north of the palace". The
        NO is due to the relative positions being different, not because they are
        at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:
        NO" and explains that Ehrenburg Palace is south of Morizkirche, not north

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Adalaj Stepwell is west of Amarkantak Thermal Power Station, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO answer was based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result that Adalaj Stepwell is not located north
        of Amarkantak Thermal Power Station. The model is confident in this answer
        and provides directional reasoning (stating it is west instead).

        stating that "Hampton Court is further west" and "Morden is slightly further
        north than Hampton Court." The NO answer is given because Morden is actually
        slightly north of Hampton Court, not because they are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a definitive conclusion that "Hampton Court railway station is not located
        north of Morden tube station." This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        (stating that Hampton Court is west of Morden), not on the locations being
        at the same position. The model explicitly indicates there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" as its
        final conclusion, and also states "the answer is YES" in its reasoning.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - it explicitly states there is a difference in position
        (Charleston is "to the east and slightly north of Dallas"). The NO is based
        on Charleston not being "directly north" of Dallas.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on its geographical analysis that
        Emanuel AME Church is not directly north of First Baptist Church Dallas.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with one church being south of the other. The NO is because the
        relationship is in the opposite direction of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, providing a clear directional explanation that
        Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church is south of First Baptist Church
        (Dallas), not north of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, saying Swansea Bay is "significantly farther
        west and slightly south" of Wood Green tube station.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the conclusion and once as the final answer. This is a definitive
        comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    09f16ea9-5842-4c53-a5eb-7ffffa863f4d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying Swansea Bay is "significantly further west and slightly
        south of London." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that Tidal Lagoon
        Swansea Bay is "not located north of Wood Green tube station."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in their
        positions, concluding that Wood Green tube station is "further north than
        Swansea Bay." The NO answer is based on this difference in position, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Tidal Lagoon Swansea Bay is
        "not" north of Wood Green tube station.

        \ at approximately 51.6\xB0N latitude, it explicitly states that \"Swansea\
        \ Bay is slightly further south than Wood Green.\" This noted difference,\
        \ even if slight, means the NO answer is not based on equal values but rather\
        \ on Swansea Bay being south of Wood Green."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" and "Final Answer:
        NO" as its comparative conclusion, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparison question.'

    d71128c2-eadf-4e80-827b-deb6bb7646d1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        - that "Swansea Bay is south of Wood Green tube station". Since it indicates
        a directional difference (even if factually incorrect), this cannot be classified
        as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the conclusion and once as the final answer, making this an unambiguous
        NO answer to the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, saying Swansea is "west" of Wood Green.
        The NO answer was given because the direction was different from what was
        asked (west instead of north).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative locations.
        The answer is definitive and based on directional analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is not applicable
        since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or position. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, describing Swansea Bay as being "southwest of London" while Wood
        Green is in "North London". The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a comparative directional analysis concluding that
        Tidal Lagoon Swansea Bay is not north of Wood Green tube station.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is not relevant
        since the answer wasn't NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference, saying
        that "Swansea Bay is south of Wood Green tube station." The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it both in the conclusion and as a final bolded statement.
