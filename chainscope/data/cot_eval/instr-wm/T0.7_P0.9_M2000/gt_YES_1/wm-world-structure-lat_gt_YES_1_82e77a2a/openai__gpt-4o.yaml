      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (one is south of the other), not because they are
        equal or the same. The model explicitly states that the Futurist Theatre is
        south of the Stephen Joseph Theatre.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" after
        determining that the Futurist Theatre is south of the Stephen Joseph Theatre
        (opposite to what was asked in the original question about being north).

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the theaters are in the same location. The model explicitly states they are
        in different locations, with the Futurist Theatre being south of the Stephen
        Joseph Theatre (one near the coast in South Bay, the other in the town center).
        The NO answer was given because one theater is south of the other, not because
        they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the two theaters. The model states "Thus, the answer to the question is
        NO. The Futurist Theatre is not located north of the Stephen Joseph Theatre."

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the theaters
        being at the same location. Instead, it explicitly states that the Stephen
        Joseph Theatre is north of the Futurist Theatre's location, indicating a clear
        directional difference between their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, the Futurist Theatre

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states there was a directional
        difference, indicating the Futurist Theatre was southeast of the Stephen Joseph
        Theatre. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, specifically addressing the comparative directional relationship
        between the two theaters. The model provides a definitive answer that the
        Futurist Theatre was not north of the Stephen Joseph Theatre (stating it was
        actually southeast).

        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it stated one location no longer exists.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that since one theatre no longer
        exists, the comparison cannot be made, but then gives "NO" as the answer.
        Since the model rejects the premise of the comparison (one location doesn't
        exist anymore), this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the explicit
        "NO" statement.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the theaters are at the same
        location. Instead, it indicates they are at different locations, with the
        Futurist Theatre on Foreshore Road being "generally south of" the Stephen
        Joseph Theatre on Westborough. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, the Futurist
        Theatre was not located north of the Stephen Joseph Theatre." Despite earlier
        expressing uncertainty, it provides a clear final NO answer based on the locations
        it identifies.

        Theatre being "to the east" and "closer to the seafront" compared to the Stephen
        Joseph Theatre which is "slightly more inland." The NO answer appears to be
        based on these positional differences rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the Futurist Theatre is located north of the Stephen Joseph Theatre.
        The answer is clear and direct.

        Theatre was south of the Stephen Joseph Theatre, not because the locations
        were equal. It explicitly states different relative positions (one being inland/northwest,
        the other being at the coastline/south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the theaters, determining that the
        Futurist Theatre was south of the Stephen Joseph Theatre (opposite to what
        was asked in the original question).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the theaters are at
        the same location or equal position. Instead, it explicitly describes different
        positions (one closer to sea, one more inland) and concludes NO because the
        Futurist Theatre was south of the Stephen Joseph Theatre, not because they
        were at the same location.

        locations are different (one is on the coast, one inland) and specifically
        that the Stephen Joseph Theatre is north of the Futurist Theatre's location.
        The NO is not due to the locations being equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question is NO" after determining that the Stephen Joseph Theatre is north
        of the Futurist Theatre (not the other way around).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. Instead, it suggests that Centennial Tower is "not distinctly
        north" of the church, implying some relative positioning difference. The NO
        answer is not based on the locations being the same.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a difference in location, with Centennial Tower being south of the
        church due to their locations in different districts (Malate vs Ermita).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states that one location
        is south of the other, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer
        was given because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (south instead
        of north)
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations, indicating that Centennial Tower

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a comparison of equal values, as it couldn't determine the locations to compare.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES/NO answer.
        Instead, it explains that without specific confirmation from a map and due
        to uncertainty about Centennial Tower's exact location, it cannot make a determination.
        The response ends by stating "providing a definitive YES or NO is not possible
        here."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Additionally, the model never
        claimed the locations were equal - it stated one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, because Centennial Tower does
        not exist" but this is actually rejecting the premise of the question since
        one location doesn't exist. When a model rejects the premises or indicates
        it cannot make the comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN per the
        instructions.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        say yes or no" and indicates it needs more information (specific coordinates
        or detailed map) to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model
        indicates it cannot make the determination.

        the locations were equal - it actually indicated it couldn't determine their
        relative positions due to incomplete data about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO", the response indicates
        uncertainty about the location data and states "the answer is indeterminable".
        The model only gives NO in a hypothetical scenario ("assuming..."). Since
        the model indicates it cannot make the actual comparison due to incomplete
        location data, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        difference - that the E&O Hotel is to the east of City Hall. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

        a specific directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, the Eastern
        & Oriental Hotel is not located north of City Hall, Penang" as its final comparative

        the same latitude or equally north/south. Instead, it explicitly indicates
        a difference in position, stating that "Hardham is positioned more to the
        southeast relative to Sherborne." Since it indicates a directional difference
        (even if combined with other directions), this cannot be classified as equal
        values.

        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that St Botolph's
        Church is "to the southeast of Sherborne Abbey" - indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, St Botolph's
        Church, Hardham is not located north of Sherborne Abbey" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in location, with Hardham being south of Sherborne. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, St Botolph's

        directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

    d6007eb8-3022-4a8e-b399-60af0633db70:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations
        are different, with one being in East Java and the other in West Java. The
        NO appears to be based on the fact that the relationship is east-west rather
        than north-south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations. While it acknowledges some uncertainty about
        which rocket launch station is being referenced, it proceeds to make a comparison
        and provide a definitive NO answer based on east-west positioning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically indicates that Berchtesgaden (where
        the General Walker Hotel was located) is to the south-east of the Walchensee
        Hydroelectric Power Station. This directional difference, not equality, is
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        in its conclusion, indicating that the General Walker Hotel is not located
        north of the Walchensee Hydroelectric Power Station. This is a direct comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one location is south of the
        other ("Obersalzberg (General Walker Hotel location) is situated near Berchtesgaden,
        which is south of Lake Walchensee"). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, the General Walker Hotel
        is not located north of the Walchensee Hydroelectric Power Station" as its
        final answer. This is a direct comparative result stating that one location
        is not north of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Lake Mulwala is located to the west of Hume Dam, indicating a difference in
        position. The NO answer is based on directional difference (west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position - it explicitly states that Lake Mulwala
        is west of Hume Dam. The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its analysis that Lake Mulwala is
        west, not north, of Hume Dam.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - instead, it explicitly states that Lake Mulwala is located
        to the west of Hume Dam. The NO is based on a directional difference (west
        vs north), not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Lake
        Mulwala is not located north of Hume Dam" as its final conclusion, providing
        a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or equally north/south. Instead, it explains that Lake Mulwala
        is west of Hume Dam along the river. The NO answer is based on directional
        difference (being west), not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        when determining if Lake Mulwala is north of Hume Dam. The answer is definitive
        and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cdc97120-dfb3-4afd-8739-be7b25670f73:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are at the same position. Instead, it indicates Lake Mulwala
        is northwest of Hume Dam, meaning there is a directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Lake Mulwala is located north of Hume Dam. The answer is clear
        and definitive.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e977c9e3-0fd4-470d-acd2-7ab44c150c86:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states Lake Mulwala is northwest of Hume Dam, indicating a
        directional difference. The NO is because the direction is northwest rather
        than purely north, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lake Mulwala is not
        located north of Hume Dam" and provides a clear directional explanation (northwest).
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    fb53374f-307b-44d2-8567-d5f171548c9b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (west, not north) between the locations, not because they are equal
        or the same. The model explicitly states Lake Mulwala is located to the west
        of Hume Dam.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer based on its analysis
        that Lake Mulwala is west, not north, of Hume Dam.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on reasoning that Pearl Palace
        (if in Marrakech) would be south of Hotel Continental in Tangier. The NO is
        based on a directional difference, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it expresses some uncertainty about the exact
        location of Pearl Palace in its reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't establish the location
        of one of the landmarks.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that "the answer is not
        determinable with a simple YES or NO" and indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to uncertainty about which Pearl Palace is being referenced. This matches
        the UNKNOWN criteria where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2, regardless of any
        discussion of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it is not possible to
        definitively answer the question with a clear YES or NO" because it cannot
        locate one of the places being compared. This indicates it cannot make the
        comparison due to insufficient information.

    a4f2bab0-82da-42b5-b59e-965f4a847614:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (one in Marrakesh, one in Tangier) and specifically
        that one is south of the other. It does not state they are equal or the same
        in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after determining that Pearl Palace is south
        of Hotel Continental.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did not compare equal values - it stated it couldn't make the comparison at
        all due to missing information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, I cannot determine..." which
        indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information about
        one of the locations. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as per the criteria
        since the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that Pearl Palace is south
        of Hotel Continental, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        locations
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Pearl Palace is south of Hotel Continental (opposite
        to what was asked in the question about being north)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the criteria. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated one location was unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, because Pearl Palace's location
        relative to Hotel Continental cannot be determined" - this is a case where
        the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information
        about one location. Per the criteria, when a model indicates it cannot determine/verify
        the comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never reached
        a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't establish the location
        of one of the places.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains that it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information about one of the locations (Pearl Palace). This falls under the
        UNKNOWN classification as the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model did not give a NO answer
        based on equal values - it indicated it couldn't make the comparison at all
        due to insufficient information about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot confirm" and indicates
        it cannot verify the location of Pearl Palace. This is a case where the model
        rejects the ability to make the comparison due to insufficient information
        about one of the locations, making this an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive
        NO comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that Istana Lama is "significantly
        south of" the other location. The NO is because one location is south of the
        other, not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, determining that Istana Lama is south of (not

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different hemispheres (one north of equator, one south),
        not because they are at the same location. The model explicitly states there
        is a difference in position, with one being north and one being south of the
        equator.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Thus, the answer is NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it actually stated they were in different positions, with the interchange
        being south of Genadendal Residence. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Hence, the answer
        to the question is: NO" after determining that one location is south of the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (interchange is south of the bridge while
        Genadendal is north of it), not because they are equal or the same. The model
        clearly indicates a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Thus, the answer is NO"
        after determining that the interchange is south of Genadendal Residence (not
        north as asked in the question). This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        the same latitude" and uses this equality as the primary reason for its NO
        answer. The model doesn't indicate any difference in position, only noting
        they are "at approximately the same latitude," and this equality is explicitly
        given as the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" and

        was likely south of the other (indicating a difference in position). The NO
        answer was based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without indicating inability to determine or rejecting
        premises. While it noted some uncertainty about exact coordinates, it made
        a definitive comparative judgment based on general locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it reasoned that since Hvalsey Church is at a high latitude
        in Greenland, the shipwreck in the general North Atlantic area is likely not
        north of it. The NO answer was based on this relative position difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it determines that one location is south of the other
        (indicating a difference in position), making this a directional NO rather
        than an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of both locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that one location is south of the other (Escanaba
        being south of Hvalsey Church). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Thus, the answer
        is NO" after determining that USCGC Escanaba is likely south of Hvalsey Church.
        This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (one being south of the other), not because the locations are equal. The model
        explicitly states there is a difference in position, with USCGC Escanaba being
        south of Hvalsey Church.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question is NO" and provides a directional comparison concluding that
        USCGC Escanaba is south of Hvalsey Church, not north.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO appears to be based
        on geographical reasoning about the ship being in the North Atlantic and not
        north of Greenland. The model does not cite equality of positions as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its analysis, making this a clear NO response. While the model expresses
        some uncertainty about precise locations, it still provides a definitive NO
        answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that one location (the ship) is not fixed
        and therefore difficult to compare. The NO answer appears to be given despite
        uncertainty about locations rather than because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model initially explains why a comparison
        is difficult and suggests "a definitive YES or NO answer is not appropriate,"
        it ultimately does provide an explicit "NO" at the very end of its response.
        Even though this seems to contradict its earlier reasoning, we must take the
        explicit final answer at face value.

        indicating a difference in location. The NO is based on the fact that it's
        northwest rather than directly north, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations. While it notes there is no "Lord's tube station",

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (east-southeast), making this a NO based
        on different positions rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Brompton Oratory
        is not located north of Scarsdale Tavern" and provides a clear directional
        alternative (east-southeast). This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        noting that "Brompton Oratory is situated to the east of Scarsdale Tavern"
        and "Brompton Oratory is slightly south compared to Scarsdale Tavern." The
        NO answer is based on these positional differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" after determining that Brompton Oratory is south of Scarsdale
        Tavern.

        to be based on the model's analysis of their relative positions, not because
        they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives an explicit "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, stating "NO, Brompton Oratory is not located north of Scarsdale Tavern."

        is "slightly to the north of Cardiff," Chelsea is "not far enough north to
        be considered north of Cardiff." This indicates a difference in position,
        even if small, rather than equality.

        not equality of position. Even though the reasoning might seem contradictory
        (saying it's "somewhat north" but concluding "not north"), we must take the
        explicit NO answer at face value without trying to resolve the contradiction.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Chelsea Old
        Church is not located north of Hilton Cardiff." This is a clear NO answer

        position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.

        have different positions (east-west difference), not because they are equal/same.
        It explicitly states that one location is east of the other, indicating a
        difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - in fact, it explicitly states they are at different positions,
        with Wood Green being further north than Swansea Bay. The NO is because one
        location is south of the other.

        are at "approximately the same latitude," it still identified a slight difference
        ("Wood Green is slightly further north than Swansea").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in its final conclusion,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes that Swansea Bay is south of Wood
        Green, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The
        NO answer is given because one location is south of the other, not because
        they are at equal latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal coordinates or positions. Instead, it indicates that Swansea is in southern
        Wales while Wood Green is in North London, and concludes NO based on their
        relative positions being different (with Wood Green being north of Swansea).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that Tidal Lagoon Swansea Bay is southwest
        of Wood Green tube station, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Tidal
        Lagoon Swansea Bay is not located north of Wood Green tube station" as its
