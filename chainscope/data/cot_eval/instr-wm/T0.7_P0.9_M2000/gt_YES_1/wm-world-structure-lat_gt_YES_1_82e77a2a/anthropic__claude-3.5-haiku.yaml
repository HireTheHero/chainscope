      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the locations are at the same position. Instead, it explicitly states they
        are in different locations and provides directional differences (one is in
        central London, the other in East London). The NO is based on their relative
        positions being different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Fitzroy Tavern is north of Burdett Road railway station.
        The answer is definitive and comparative.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Fitzroy Tavern being west of Burdett Road station), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position between central London and East London.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a clear directional difference, stating that
        Burdett Road is east of Fitzroy Tavern. The NO answer is based on relative
        positioning (west/east relationship), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion after reasoning about the relative locations. This is a direct
        comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference (Fitzroy Tavern is west of Burdett Road station)
        and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, stating that Fitzroy Tavern is west, not
        north, of Burdett Road station.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions
        (one in central London, one in East London) and concludes that Fitzroy Tavern
        is SOUTH of Burdett Road station. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations.'

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any discussion of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" because it cannot verify the locations. This
        indicates inability to make the comparison rather than refusal to answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    d55c0242-df4d-4bc3-9357-a0ac0347f73b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't verify their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly says this is
        because it "cannot verify" or "confirm" the locations, not as a comparative
        result. This is a case where the model is indicating it cannot make the determination,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical - rather, the NO was given because
        the model determined one location was south of the other. The model explicitly
        states "Futurist Theatre is located south of Stephen Joseph Theatre."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        theatre is south of the other, not because they are at the same location.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference (Futurist Theatre
        is "south of" the Stephen Joseph Theatre), so this is not a case of equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step reasoning

        it does not state they are at equal locations - in fact, it explicitly states
        they are at different locations (Foreshore Road vs. town center) and concludes
        that one is south of the other. The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        in position, saying "Tulse Hill is actually south of Sudbrook Park." The NO
        is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        in its conclusion, indicating that Tulse Hill railway station is NOT located

        The NO is because one location is south of the other, not because they're
        at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        (one being south of the other), not because the locations are equal. The model
        explicitly states they are in different locations and that one is south of
        the other.

        there is a directional difference (Collinsville is south of Lake Moondarra).
        Any directional difference, even if slight, means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes that Collinsville is located south of Lake Moondarra,
        not north as asked in the question. This is a clear comparative directional
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses that the comparison is not
        meaningful and difficult to determine, it does not state that the locations
        are equal or the same in any way. The NO answer appears to be given because
        the locations are in different states and the comparison is deemed not meaningful,
        not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it expresses some hesitation about making the comparison, it does
        provide this definitive NO response rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it does
        not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it says they
        are "not directly comparable" and "in different states." The NO answer is
        based on the inability to compare rather than any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially expresses uncertainty about making
        the comparison but then explicitly chooses "NO" as its final answer, though
        it qualifies this by saying the locations are not directly comparable. Since
        the model gives "NO" as its final definitive answer, despite its hesitation,
        this should be classified as NO.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        compared actual values or declared them equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer" and concludes it does not have enough information to answer.
        This is a clear case where the model refuses to make the comparison due to
        insufficient information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot responsibly
        answer YES or NO" and "does not have enough information to answer this question

        model never claims the locations are equal or the same; instead, it states
        they cannot have a north/south relationship because they're in different states.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, providing a definitive comparative answer based

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that St Botolph's Church
        is south of Sherborne Abbey, indicating a clear directional difference between
        their locations. The NO answer was given because the premise of the question
        (suggesting northward position) was incorrect, not because the locations were
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative location question, providing it as a direct
        answer without any caveats or uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        noting that "Sherborne Abbey is in Dorset" and "Dorset is geographically north
        of West Sussex". The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether St Botolph's Church, Hardham is located north of Sherborne
        Abbey. The answer is given as a direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Lake
        Mulwala is south of Hume Dam, not because the locations are equal. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Lake Mulwala is actually
        located south of Hume Dam").

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Lake Mulwala is "located south of Hume Dam" - indicating a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Lake Mulwala is "south of Hume Dam" - indicating a difference in position,
        which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Lake Mulwala is located north of Hume Dam. The answer
        is direct and comparative.

        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot verify the relative positions due to
        lack of information. Since the model states it "cannot confidently state whether
        Pearl Palace is north of Hotel Continental" and gives NO due to "lack of certainty,"
        this is effectively stating it cannot determine the answer, making this an
        UNKNOWN response despite the "NO" word at the end.

        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm with certainty...)"
        which indicates it cannot determine the relative positions. This is a case
        where the model explicitly states it cannot verify or determine the comparison,

      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot confidently state whether
        Pearl Palace is north" due to lack of precise location data, but concludes
        with "NO". Since this indicates inability to determine the comparison rather
        than a comparative result, this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that one church
        is north of the other. The NO appears to be because the relative positions
        were opposite to what was asked in the original question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is "slightly south" of the other, not because they are at the same
        location. Any difference in position, even if described as "slight," means
        we should classify this as False
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Palazzo Giustiniani is south of Sant'Ignazio (not north)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Sant'Ignazio
        is "slightly northeast" and "has a slightly higher latitude" than Palazzo
        Giustiniani, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was given
        because the relationship was in the opposite direction of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions of the
        two buildings. The answer is definitive and matches the format "Answer: NO".'

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Palazzo Giustiniani
        is "slightly south of Sant'Ignazio" - indicating a difference in position,
        not equality. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative result that Palazzo Giustiniani is NOT located

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Palazzo Giustiniani is actually
        slightly south of Sant'Ignazio" - indicating a directional difference, not
        equality. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on the
        locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question about relative positions, with no
        caveats or uncertainty about its ability to make the determination.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    a5d3b472-5dd9-4ab7-a1d3-4da1da8dfb7e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found Palazzo
        Giustiniani is south of Sant'Ignazio, not because the locations are equal.
        It explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions and concluding that Palazzo Giustiniani
        is south of Sant'Ignazio (not north)

    d2fbc4d4-e7b0-4faa-b176-6a35e82dfdd1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Palazzo Giustiniani
        is "slightly south of Sant'Ignazio" - this indicates a difference in position,
        not equality. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        the locations being at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result addressing the spatial relationship
        between the two locations, with "NOT located north of" being explicitly stated.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    dadf86f8-b155-4370-a5bc-d775d0408273:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Palazzo Giustiniani is located south of Sant'Ignazio, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result that Palazzo Giustiniani is NOT located
        north of Sant'Ignazio. The answer is definitive and explicitly stated.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal - it explicitly states that Sydney is "further south"
        than Genadendal Residence, indicating a difference in latitude. The NO appears
        to be rejecting a premise about one being north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its analysis that one
        location is south of the other rather than north.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never suggested
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this means it cannot confirm the positioning. This is effectively stating
        it cannot make the determination, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than
        a definitive NO comparative answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    5db4a85e-1e6c-4bec-a125-c003a8ae5393:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it does
        not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates
        it cannot confirm the geographic relationship due to lacking precise coordinates.
        The NO is explicitly stated to be not based on certain knowledge rather than
        being based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        despite expressing uncertainty. While it indicates low confidence, it does
        provide a definitive NO rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot
        determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I do not have sufficient information
        to confirm the location relationship)" which indicates it cannot determine
        the relationship. This is effectively stating it cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never mentioned
        the locations being equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confidently affirm...)"
        which indicates it cannot determine the comparison, rather than making a comparative
        conclusion. This is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot verify
        the relationship, making this an UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot verify" and
        "does not know" the relative positions, and while it provides "NO" as an answer,
        it immediately qualifies this as being due to insufficient information rather
        than an actual comparative result. This matches the criteria for UNKNOWN where
        the model indicates it cannot make the determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    ae1092a1-bd17-48bb-a7f8-ab13c60d9996:

        automatically results in False for question 2. The model never claimed the
        locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot answer this
        question with a definitive YES or NO" due to lacking precise location information.
        This indicates it cannot make the comparison rather than refusing to answer,
        making it an UNKNOWN response.

        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this means it cannot confidently confirm the relationship due to lack of data.
        This is effectively stating it cannot determine the answer, making this an
        UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any claims about equal values - it simply stated it lacked information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and explains it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are at equal
        positions. Instead, it explicitly states differences in their positions, noting
        that Maharana Pratap Sagar is "further south" and Khushab Nuclear Complex
        is "more northerly". The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        that Maharana Pratap Sagar is south of Khushab Nuclear Complex, not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference ("Rajasthan is south of Punjab"), so this is not
        a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

        there is a directional difference, saying that Maharana Pratap Sagar is "actually
        SOUTH of Khushab Nuclear Complex." The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question about whether Maharana Pratap Sagar
        is north of Khushab Nuclear Complex. The answer is definitive and directly
        addresses the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was because Khushab
        is explicitly stated to be north of Maharana Pratap Sagar, indicating a clear
        directional difference between their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" and explains

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - it explicitly states that Thevally Palace
        is south of the British Residency, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the model never claimed the locations were at equal positions - it simply
        stated it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm it is north)"
        which indicates it cannot determine the relative positions. This is a case
        where the model explicitly states it cannot verify/determine the comparison,
        making it an UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative result.

        is contained within the other, making the directional comparison impossible/invalid.
        The model never states that the locations are at the same coordinates or equal
        in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on spatial reasoning that the
        Black House cannot be north of Old Town since it's within it.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explains that one location (Black House) is contained within the
        other location (Old Town), which is why it cannot be north of it. This containment
        relationship, not equality, is the reason given for the NO answer.

        the answer is: NO" as its final comparative answer'

        is a different spatial relationship than equality. The NO answer is based
        on this containment relationship, not on the locations being equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        south of Hvalesy Church," indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        it still provides a definitive NO answer in step 5, making this a clear NO
        response rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were at equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly stated
        they were in different positions, with Sorpe Dam being north of Midford Castle.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        that "the question cannot be definitively answered" and notes that one structure
        (Motherwell Cathedral) doesn't exist while the other (Hamilton Palace) is
        demolished. This rejection of the premises makes this an UNKNOWN response,

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and concludes that it "Cannot definitively answer due to
        incorrect premise" because one of the locations (Motherwell Cathedral) doesn't
        exist. This is a case where the model rejects the premises of the question.

        values - it was stating that one of the locations doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question because
        Motherwell Cathedral doesn't exist, making the comparison impossible. While
        it says "NO", it's actually stating it cannot make the comparison due to invalid
        premises, which fits our criteria for UNKNOWN.

        is geographically north of where Hamilton Palace was located". Although it
        notes an issue with the premise (no Motherwell Cathedral), it proceeds to
        answer the geographical comparison with a clear YES.

        claimed the locations were equal - it actually noted Hamilton is slightly
        south of Motherwell.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating "Motherwell
        Cathedral does not exist" and indicates the question "cannot be answered as
        stated." Although it ends with "NO," this NO is explicitly because one location
        doesn't exist, not as a comparative result. Per the instructions, when a model
        rejects premises or indicates it cannot determine an answer, this should be
        classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but does so while rejecting the premise because one of the compared entities
        (Motherwell Cathedral) does not exist. According to the classification rules,

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but rejects the premise by stating that Motherwell Cathedral doesn't exist,

        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confidently confirm
        the north/south positioning)" which indicates it cannot determine the comparison.
        This is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot verify/determine
        the relationship, making this an UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences
        (St Mary's Church being northwest of Hoar Cross Hall, rather than directly
        north), not because the locations are equal. The model explicitly notes a
        difference in position.

        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this NO is due to insufficient information to make the determination
        ("I cannot confidently determine", "cannot definitively state"). This makes
        it a case of being unable to verify/determine rather than a comparative result,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        the locations were equal - it simply couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this NO is due to inability to confirm ("I cannot confirm a YES"). This
        makes it clear that the model is actually expressing uncertainty rather than
        making a comparative determination, so this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this NO means it cannot confirm the location with certainty. This is
        effectively stating it cannot determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN

        were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because I cannot confidently
        confirm the church's location)" - this is explicitly stating it cannot determine
        the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative
        result.

        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot confidently determine"
        and "cannot definitively state" the relative positions, but then gives "NO"
        as its final answer. Since the model explicitly indicates it cannot make the
        comparison, this falls under the UNKNOWN criteria, despite the "NO" at the

        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" after stating
        it cannot confirm the geographical relationship with certainty. Since this
        NO is specifically because it cannot determine/verify the relationship, this
        should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than a comparative NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and concludes that it does not have enough information to
        answer with certainty. This indicates an inability to make the comparison
        rather than a refusal or a clear YES/NO answer.

        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot confidently confirm" the relative positions. This
        is effectively stating it cannot determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN
        response rather than a definitive NO comparative result.

        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Adalaj Stepwell being south of Amarkantak Thermal Power Station), not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states there
        is a difference in position, with one being south of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Adalaj is
        southwest of Amarkantak, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the locations were at the same latitude. The model explicitly states that
        Northolt is southwest of St Augustine's Tower, indicating different positions.
        The NO answer was based on directional difference, not equality.

        (west vs north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Charleston being "further south than Dallas"), not because the locations
        are at the same coordinates. The model explicitly states they are "hundreds
        of miles apart" and in "different states," indicating a clear difference rather

        is "southeast of Dallas", indicating a directional difference between the
        locations. The model does not state that the locations are equal or the same
        - rather, it explicitly notes they are different (in different states, hundreds
        of miles apart, with one southeast of the other).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Emanuel AME Church is "NOT

        the opposite directional relationship (south instead of north) rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step reasoning
        process and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its comparative answer, stating
