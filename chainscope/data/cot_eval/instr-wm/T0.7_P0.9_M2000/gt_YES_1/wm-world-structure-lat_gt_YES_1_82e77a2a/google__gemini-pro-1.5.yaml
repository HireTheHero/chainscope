      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly noted a difference in their positions, with the Futurist
        Theatre being on the seafront and the Stephen Joseph Theatre being further
        inland and south. This difference in position, not equality, was the basis
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear and explicit "NO" as its final
        answer after comparing the locations of the two theaters.

        or the same - instead, it explicitly notes that Petersham and Richmond are
        "considerably further west and slightly further south than Tulse Hill." The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to the question about relative position,
        not a refusal or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (northeast
        vs north). The NO is because being "northeast" doesn't satisfy the criterion
        of being "directly north".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that while St Andrew's House is northeast of the Balmoral
        Hotel, it's not directly north.

      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question by stating
        that "St. Helen's, Booterstown" is not a valid single location, making the
        comparison impossible as stated. While it does give a "NO" answer, it's explicitly

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as the final answer, it does
        not state that the values or positions being compared are equal. Instead,
        it explicitly states that "Rocksavage is north of St Helen's" and objects
        to the question's framing regarding Booterstown. The NO answer is based on
        the question's structure/framing, not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result, even though it criticizes the question's
        framing. The NO is not a refusal to answer or an indication of inability to
        determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it found a directional difference
        (east-northeast instead of north), not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly notes a directional difference, so this is
        not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that Runcorn is east-northeast of Dublin rather than

    a978ff29-0a23-4f04-8002-4f78beca775a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a different reason for its NO answer - that
        one location being in Ireland made the comparison "irrelevant" to the other
        locations in England. Since equality was not mentioned as the reason for the
        NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer, and while it discussed the complexity of the comparison, it did provide
        this clear negative comparative result.

    c892ac8a-1854-46d2-a63f-fd1742d81dbc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that Rocksavage
        is "broadly east, not north" of Dublin. This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality. The model is stating there is a different directional relationship
        (east) rather than saying the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" in its conclusion and
        provides it again as a standalone answer at the end. The answer is a direct
        comparative result stating that one location is not north of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference ("slightly south"), not equality. Even though the difference is
        described as "slight," any stated difference means the NO answer was not due
        to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response based
        on its analysis that the E&O Hotel is "slightly south of City Hall".

        the hotel is southeast of City Hall, not because the locations are equal/identical.
        It explicitly states a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final comparative conclusion, based on finding that
        one location is southeast of the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or suggest that the locations
        are equal or the same. Instead, it implies a directional relationship (downstream/south),
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer appears to be based on
        this directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify. While
        the reasoning is somewhat incomplete, it provides a clear NO response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it reached its NO conclusion
        based on reasoning about relative positions (one being downstream of the other),
        not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or suggest that the values
        being compared are equal/same/identical. Instead, it discusses relative positions
        (downstream) and directions, implying a difference in location. The NO answer
        appears to be based on this positional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify. While
        the reasoning is somewhat unclear, it provides a direct NO response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that Pearl Palace is south of Hotel
        Continental, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations
        rather than equality. The NO answer is based on this difference in position,
        not on the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after determining that Pearl Palace is south of Hotel Continental.

    4babb0b5-5842-4cb4-b86c-511afcc9f267:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (because
        the model rejected the premise by stating one location doesn't exist in Tangier),
        we must answer False regardless of the reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result based on its reasoning
        that one location is not in Tangier, making the comparison impossible.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        is south of Hotel Continental (via their cities' relative positions), not
        because the locations are at the same position. It explicitly notes a directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on the relative positions it

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that one location is south-west of the other), not because the locations
        are equal or the same. The model explicitly indicates there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        to support this conclusion.

      result: 'NO'
    5909ebad-f8c2-407b-85fa-e918d0dc1e4c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Menai is "south of" Macquarie Fields), not because the locations
        are at the same position. Since it identifies a directional difference, even
        if factually incorrect, this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical
        analysis that the first location is south of, not north of, the second location.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it gave a directional difference, stating that Menai is "further
        south" than the interchange's location. This difference in position, not equality,
        was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as its final comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    99be9255-f346-424f-a5fb-8afab9e6df29:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (one location being south of the other), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states "the interchange is south of Wahroonga,
        and therefore south of Genadendal Residence."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after providing its step-by-step reasoning about the relative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Menai (where the interchange is) is south of Jannali (where the residence
        is). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that the interchange is not north of the residence.
        This is a direct comparative answer without any caveats about uncertainty
        or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (Menai is south of Normanhurst), not
        because they are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states a directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, based on its directional comparison finding that one location
        is south of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes different locations - with Thevally
        Palace being "slightly southwest of the city center" and the British Residency
        being "closer to the city center, north of the lake." The NO answer appears
        to be based on these different positions, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Thevally Palace was found to be "slightly southwest" of the British Residency
        - indicating a directional difference, even if slight.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion, based on finding that Thevally Palace is southwest, not
        north, of the British Residency. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        of the Old Town square", indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        Even though the difference is described as "slight", any stated difference
        means this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same. Instead, it explained that Black House is located within Old Town,
        making it impossible to be north of it. This is a logical/positional reason
        rather than an equality reason.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explains that Black House is "within"
        Old Town, which is a different spatial relationship entirely. This is a clear
        difference in position, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct response to whether Black House
        is north of Old Town.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates Black House is "part of"
        Old Town, it doesn't explicitly state they are at the same location or elevation,
        nor does it specifically cite equality as the reason for the NO answer. The
        reasoning is more about one being contained within the other rather than being
        at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer
        without any qualifications about inability to determine or verify. While the
        reasoning suggests Black House is part of Old Town, making comparison potentially
        problematic, the model still gave a direct NO answer.

    b6f086d3-6d14-48db-b644-ec3c40fc7709:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's because one location (Black House)
        is contained within the other (Old Town). The model explicitly states "Black
        House is on the Market Square within the Old Town" as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a comparative directional conclusion based on its
        analysis that Black House is within Old Town.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - instead, it's based on a different spatial relationship (being "within"
        rather than "north of"). The model explicitly states that one location is
        contained within the other, which is a different relationship than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model did not claim the locations were equal - it actually suggested one was
        likely further north than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Likely YES, but more information
        is needed to be definitive." This is not a clear YES/NO answer, as it expresses
        uncertainty and conditions. The response indicates it cannot make a definitive
        determination without more precise location data.

        - in fact, it explicitly states that they are different, with Hvalsey Church
        being "considerably further north" than the Escanaba's location. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly stated there was a difference, saying "Greenland is
        much further north than the US Atlantic coast" and concluded that one location
        was south of the other. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations and determining that USCGC
        Escanaba was south of Hvalsey Church.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as its reason for
        the NO answer, specifically that the Escanaba is south of Greenland while
        the church is in southern Greenland.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        Instead, it gave a NO answer based on reasoning that the Escanaba sank in
        the southwestern region while Hvalsey Church is in southern Greenland, indicating
        different (though nearby) locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

        instead, it explicitly noted a directional difference, stating that "Southern
        Greenland is north of the North Atlantic where Escanaba sank." The NO answer
        was based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        also did not make any claims about equal values - it instead stated that one
        location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but rejects the premise by stating that one of the locations (USCGC Escanaba)
        no longer exists and therefore has no location, making the comparison impossible.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where "the model rejects the premises

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides information indicating that Colaba (where
        the Cathedral is) is actually south of Nariman Point, which is why it concludes
        NO. This is a directional difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after its reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it reasoned through the relative positions and concluded
        that Nariman Point is likely south of the Cathedral, giving a directional
        difference as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response.

    96eb36a7-a31c-43e0-8d24-9cc9d816febb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides directional information indicating Nariman
        Point is south of Colaba, but still concludes NO. While this may seem contradictory
        with its reasoning steps, we must evaluate only what was explicitly stated
        without trying to resolve inconsistencies.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after laying out its reasoning steps.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in their positions,
        stating that one is "southernmost" while the other is "further north and closer
        to the city center". The NO answer appears to be based on these directional
        differences rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations, making this an
        explicit NO answer to the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined there was a directional
        difference (the Cathedral being "somewhat north" of Nariman Point where the
        Trident is located).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning about relative positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead it indicates there is a directional difference, stating
        that one location is north of the other. The NO answer appears to be based
        on this directional difference rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after providing geographical reasoning about the relative positions
        of the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying
        the Trident Hotel is "slightly south-west of the Cathedral." Even though the
        difference is described as "slight," any stated directional difference means
        this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the locations and determining that the Trident
        Hotel is slightly south-west of the Cathedral.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Nariman Point being south of Colaba), not because the locations are at the
        same position. The model explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        with one being south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that the Trident Hotel
        is not north of the Cathedral.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position ("Kriel is further south than Matla"), so the NO answer is based
        on a difference rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Kriel is
        "slightly southwest of Matla"). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Kriel is southwest of Matla, and therefore cannot be
        north of it. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Kriel is "slightly southwest of Ogies" (where Matla is located), indicating
        a directional difference. Even though the difference might be small ("slightly"),
        any stated directional difference means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Kriel is not north of Matla. This is a direct
        comparative answer to the implicit question of whether Kriel is north of Matla.

        Kriel Power Station is south of Matla Power Station. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        or identical. Instead, it explicitly notes a directional difference, stating
        that "Kriel Power Station is southwest of Matla Power Station". Even though
        both are in the same province, the model identifies a specific directional
        difference as the basis for comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared were equal. Instead, it gave a different reason (though logically
        flawed) related to the relationship between west and latitude. The model did
        not state or imply that the locations were at the same position or coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative

        in location (English Disco was east of the Starwood) based on different address
        numbers (7567 vs 8151). The NO answer was given because of this difference,
        not because the locations were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, determining that the English Disco was east
        of the Starwood based on their street numbers.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the locations
        are equal/same - instead, it explained that while part of Inya Lake is north
        of the address, a significant portion extends south and east, making the "north
        of" statement not entirely accurate. This indicates a difference in positions,
        not equality.

    8d60cbef-0d70-4062-a203-00057e2dffe7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it concludes NO based on reasoning that one location
        is west of the other, indicating a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing reasoning about the relative locations of the two places.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9f40f777-37cb-4ba2-b65a-468a32b113f8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate if equal values were
        the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO definitively" and indicates that more information would be needed to make
        the determination. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - instead, it indicated there were directional differences, noting
        that Northolt is "west, and possibly slightly north" of Hackney. The NO answer
        was based on directional differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly stated that Hampton Court is "significantly
        west and slightly south of Morden", indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify
        the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    27b3c981-18d5-48ec-8c25-cba3b7c9de4b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the stations
        being at equal positions. Instead, it explicitly described differences in
        their positions, noting that Hampton Court is "very clearly west of Morden"
        and mentioned possible latitude differences. The NO answer was based on directional
        differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after its
        analysis, providing a clear comparative answer about the relative positions
        of the stations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it went through a reasoning
        process about zones and distances, concluding with NO based on its analysis
        of relative positions, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its reasoning steps, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    5abf62a0-59ce-46e8-b6e5-42882404eee8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it walked through a logical
        analysis about zones and directions, and concluded NO based on that reasoning.
        The values being compared (locations) were explicitly described as being in
        different zones (6 vs 4).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.

    6cdd3229-43a3-404f-a4fb-ab812ab8d3ce:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted both locations are in Zone 6,
        this wasn't given as the reason for the NO answer. Instead, the model determined
        through map consultation that Hampton Court is west-southwest of Morden, indicating
        a directional difference. The NO wasn't based on equal values but on this
        directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear and explicit "NO" as its final
        answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify. While
        it went through analysis steps, it concluded with a definitive NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning based on zone numbers and directions,
        concluding NO because its logic suggests Hampton Court (Zone 6) is not south
        of Morden (Zone 4).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that one church is south of the other (South
        Boulevard is south of San Jacinto Street). The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
