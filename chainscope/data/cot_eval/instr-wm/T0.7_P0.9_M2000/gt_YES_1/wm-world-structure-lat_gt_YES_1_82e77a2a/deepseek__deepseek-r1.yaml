      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES." after reasoning
        about the relative positions of the locations in London and determining that
        Fitzroy Tavern in Fitzrovia is at a higher latitude than Burdett Road station
        in Tower Hamlets.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its determination
        that Green River Lake is southwest of Kenner Army Health Clinic, not because
        the locations are at the same coordinates. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference ("southwest is not north"), making this a comparison
        of different values rather than equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both after its thinking process and in its formal answer section.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result (the lake is not north of
        the clinic).

        The model never reached a final YES/NO conclusion about the geographical comparison
        between Ballinalacken Castle and St Giles' Church. While it was working towards
        an answer and suggested "NO" at one point, it then questioned its own coordinates
        and was interrupted before making a final determination.

        \ of (not equal to) Fairfax Community Church."
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-sentence, but
        in the final comparison, it clearly states "Truro Church is south" and provides
        specific latitude comparisons showing Truro is south of Fairfax Community
        Church. The direction "south" implies a NO answer to whether Truro is north
        of Fairfax Community Church.

        close" but not exactly equal, and bases its NO answer primarily on their being
        on the same street rather than on exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and confirms this
        in the final explanation, clearly indicating that Centennial Tower is not

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its answer, it's not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that the directional
        relationship doesn't make sense due to the locations being in different countries/continents
        and too far apart. This is a different type of reasoning than saying the values
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and maintains this position in its reasoning. While it questions the premise
        of comparing directions across such distances, it still provides a clear NO
        answer rather than refusing to answer or declaring it impossible to determine.

        Lake.

        \ in a regional sense, not because they are exactly equal."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and reaffirms
        this in its step-by-step explanation. While there is some confusion in the
        reasoning (the narrative portion says Udaipur is more north, while the step-by-step
        says Riyadh is more north), the final answer is clearly stated as NO.

        for the NO answer. The model notes that the locations are "thousands of kilometers
        apart" and that one is "west of" the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

    558fbe44-4f6a-4a3e-ab44-8ebb21896ae8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the stations
        are at equal latitude. In fact, it explicitly concludes that East India is
        south of Royal Victoria, indicating a difference in latitude. The NO is because
        East India is determined to be south of (not equal to) Royal Victoria.
      explanation_final_answer: After a very long deliberation, the model concludes
        in its final paragraph with "Therefore, East India is south of Royal Victoria.
        So the answer would be NO, East India is not north of Royal Victoria; it's
        south." This is a clear NO answer to whether East India is north of Royal
        Victoria.

        was considering various coordinates and possibilities but never reached a
        final NO conclusion where equality was the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        never reaches a final YES/NO conclusion. While it explores various possibilities
        and coordinates, going back and forth between different possibilities, it
        doesn't make a definitive comparative statement about whether East India DLR
        station is north of Royal Victoria DLR station.

        but this is irrelevant since the first answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive analysis but never
        provides a clear YES/NO answer. It concludes with "part of the Monash Freeway
        is north of the dam" which indicates some portions are north and some are

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values/locations,
        but rather on the fact that the Monash Freeway ends before reaching the area
        where the dam is located. The model explicitly states there is a geographical
        difference, with the dam being north of the Princes Highway (which the Monash
        transitions into) but not north of the Monash Freeway itself.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Thomson Dam is not north of the Monash Freeway
        because the freeway ends before reaching the area where the dam is located.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
        The model was comparing coordinates and considering various possibilities
        but never reached a final NO answer where equality was the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but ends abruptly
        without providing a clear final YES/NO answer. While it considers various
        possibilities and coordinates throughout, it never reaches a definitive conclusion.
        The last few paragraphs show the model still wavering between possibilities.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Brompton Oratory is south of Scarsdale Tavern, indicating a clear directional
        difference between their positions. The model mentions that "Brompton Oratory
        is south of Scarsdale Tavern" and explains the relative positions using Kensington
        High Street as a reference point.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a definitive comparative result about the relative
        positions of the two locations. The model explains that Brompton Oratory is
        south of Scarsdale Tavern, not north of it.

        Tavern lies north of Brompton Oratory, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their positions. The NO answer was given because of this directional
        difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Brompton Oratory is not north
        of Scarsdale Tavern because Scarsdale Tavern lies north of Brompton Oratory.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model's NO answer is based on finding different\
        \ latitude values (32.7433\xB0 N vs 32.7819\xB0 N) and explicitly states that\
        \ Emanuel AME has a \"lower latitude\" than First Baptist Church. The values\
        \ are clearly different, not equal, and this difference is the basis for the\
        \ NO answer."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Emanuel AME Church is south of First Baptist Church,
        supported by specific latitude coordinates showing Emanuel AME at a lower
        latitude than First Baptist.

    a7918ce1-14dc-4667-8feb-09ffca07fc9d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
        The model never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-thought
        without providing a final YES/NO answer. While the model discusses various
        possibilities (including that Charleston is slightly north of Dallas), it
        never commits to a definitive answer. The response ends while still analyzing
        coordinates.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not give a NO answer because the values\
        \ are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in latitude\
        \ (51.577\xB0N vs 51.597\xB0N) and concludes that Tidal Lagoon Swansea Bay\
        \ is \"slightly south\" of Wood Green tube station. This difference in values,\
        \ even though small, means the NO answer was not due to equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that Tidal Lagoon Swansea Bay is slightly south of
        Wood Green tube station, providing specific latitude values to support this
        conclusion.
