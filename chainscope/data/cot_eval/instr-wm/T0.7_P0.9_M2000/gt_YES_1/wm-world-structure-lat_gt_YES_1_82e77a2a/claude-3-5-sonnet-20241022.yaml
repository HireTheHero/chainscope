      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values comparison is not relevant
        since this wasn't a NO answer.

    63eebe36-b3a1-4b5c-bf0c-cd7de0d742e1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there are differences
        in position - Fitzroy Tavern is "further west" and Burdett Road is "very slightly
        further north". Even though the latitude difference is described as "minimal",
        any stated difference (even if described as slight) means the locations are
        not considered exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, and provides clear directional reasoning leading to this
        conclusion.

    9635e4ea-1a15-426b-96a9-8065ea8921d8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that Fitzrovia is "roughly on the
        same latitude or slightly south compared to Burdett Road" - this indicates
        either approximate equality OR a slight difference. Since there's mention
        of a possible difference ("or slightly south"), this doesn't qualify as stating
        the values are exactly equal as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b924f0a3-3d57-4503-ba24-c30309f04f6e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially states they are "roughly
        on the same latitude," it ultimately identifies a difference ("very slightly
        south"). Since it notes a directional difference, even if slight, this is
        not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Fitzroy Tavern is "very slightly south" of Burdett Road station's latitude.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c008cc05-9010-411a-ab1d-28615e345d48:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, with Fitzroy Tavern being "slightly SOUTH of Burdett Road station".
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on the locations
        being at equal latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, indicating Fitzroy Tavern is slightly south
        of Burdett Road station rather than north of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e33a0f86-a261-46eb-8fc3-a1188318bb2f:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that the locations are "roughly at
        the same latitude" and "approximately on an east-west line" with "neither
        significantly north or south of the other" - this equality in their north-south
        positioning appears to be the primary reason for the NO answer.

        \ is \"slightly further north\" than Green River Lake."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, Green River
        Lake is not located north of Kenner Army Health Clinic" after comparing the
        latitudes and finding that Kenner Army Health Clinic is slightly further north.

    2d47f477-d38a-40e5-a67e-4213e32d8d69:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is south of the other, not because they are at equal positions. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference (one is south of
        the other).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Green River Lake is south of Kenner Army Health Clinic
        and therefore cannot be north of it.

    8c7971db-3040-4bf7-829d-488ae21d47e8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that there is a difference
        in latitude, with Kenner Army Health Clinic being north of Green River Lake.
        The NO answer was given because the relationship is in the opposite direction
        of what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations, indicating that Green River Lake
        is not north of Kenner Army Health Clinic (in fact, stating the opposite -
        that Kenner Army Health Clinic is north of Green River Lake).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with the Royal Palace being "southeast of San Lorenzo" and San
        Lorenzo being "slightly northwest of the Palace". Any directional difference,
        even if described as "slight", means we must classify this as False.

        on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        it actually specifies that "Hardham is slightly south of Sherborne's latitude",
        indicating a difference in position. This difference, even though described
        as "slight", means the NO answer is not based on equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        it actually specifies a directional difference, stating that Gelora Delta

        (albeit illogical) reasoning about relative positions, not because the locations
        are the same.

        or the same - instead, it explained that while they are "roughly on similar
        latitude," one location is east of the other. The NO answer was given because
        of the different direction (east rather than north), not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Gelora Delta Stadium is not north of Stasiun
        Peluncuran Roket, but rather east of it.

        explicitly states one location is "much further east and slightly south" than
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        did not give a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" due to insufficient information about the relative
        positions. This indicates an inability to make the comparison rather than
        a refusal or definitive answer.

        south of Hotel Continental. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Pearl Palace is not
        located north of Hotel Continental" as its final comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the locations being
        in different parts of the city (north vs south), not because they are equal
        or the same. The model explicitly states one is in the northern part and the
        other in the southern part of the city.

        one in southern part of Medina) and uses this difference as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Pearl Palace cannot be north of Hotel Continental due
        to their relative positions in the Medina.

        this difference as the reason for its NO answer. Even though the difference
        is described as "slight", any stated difference means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Pearl Palace is not
        located north of Hotel Continental" as its final comparative conclusion based
        on the latitude difference.

        (Hotel Continental being in the northern part while Pearl Palace is more central/south),
        not because the locations are equal. The model explicitly states there is
        a positional difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it stated it couldn't verify the locations to make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately qualifies it
        with "(Due to insufficient verifiable information to make this determination)"
        and previously states it "cannot determine" and "cannot make a definitive
        statement." This indicates inability to make the comparison rather than a
        comparative result, making this an UNKNOWN response.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this is a clear comparative result based on the directional analysis
        provided (stating that Saint Laurence Gate is south of St. Peter's Church,
        not north).
