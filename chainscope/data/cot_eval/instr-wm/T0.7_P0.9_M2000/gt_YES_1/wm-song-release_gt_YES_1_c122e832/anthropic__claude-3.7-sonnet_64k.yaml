        times (1998 vs 2008) and concludes NO because Kokia's song was released earlier,
        not later than Santigold's. The model is noting a difference in values, not
        equality.

        in different months of 1964 - "Bald Headed Woman" in August and "The Race
        Is On" in September. The model's NO answer is based on the fact that The Kinks's
        song was released EARLIER than George Jones's song, not that they were released
        at the same time.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the songs
        were released at different times - "This Is Where I Came In" in April 2001
        and "I Like Them Girls" in May 2001. The model's NO answer is based on the
        fact that the Bee Gees song was released BEFORE the Tyrese Gibson song, not
        because they were released at the same time.

        different times (Dean Martin's song in 1957 and the Rolling Stones' song in
        1967). The model's NO answer is based on the fact that Dean Martin's song
        was released EARLIER than the Rolling Stones' song, not that they were released
        at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model directly answers the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Dean Martin's song was
        released in 1957 while The Rolling Stones' song was released in 1967, indicating
        a 10-year difference. The NO answer is based on the fact that Dean Martin's
        song was released EARLIER, not that they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, clearly indicating that Dean Martin's "Just a Bummin'
        Around" was NOT released later than The Rolling Stones's "2000 Light Years

        released "approximately 15 years BEFORE" the Rolling Stones' song. The model
        gives a specific reason for the NO answer - that one song was released earlier
        than the other, not that they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Dean Martin's Just a Bummin' Around released later than
        The Rolling Stones's 2000 Light Years from Home?" The answer is clearly stated

        times - Dean Martin's song in the early 1950s (around 1953) and The Rolling
        Stones' song in December 1967. The model says "NO" because Dean Martin's song
        was released BEFORE The Rolling Stones' song, not because they were released
        at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "Dean Martin''s song was released approximately 14
        years BEFORE The Rolling Stones song, not later" and explicitly states "Answer:

        were released at different times - "Rat Race" in 2012 and "Pink and Blue"
        in 2014, with approximately 2 years difference. The NO answer is because "Rat
        Race" was released EARLIER, not later than "Pink and Blue".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response.
        It explains that "Rat Race" (2012) came out approximately 2 years before "Pink
        and Blue" (2014), and therefore "Enter Shikari's song was released EARLIER,
        not later." The final answer is explicitly "NO".

        that "Rat Race" was released in 2013 while "Pink and Blue" was released in
        2014, meaning "Rat Race" was released EARLIER than "Pink and Blue." The model
        explicitly states the dates are different (May 30, 2013 vs. November 17, 2014)
        and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Enter Shikari's Rat Race released later than Hannah Diamond's
        Pink and Blue?" The model clearly indicates that "Rat Race" was released EARLIER,
        not later than "Pink and Blue," and concludes with a definitive "NO" at the

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Hamasaki's song was released EARLIER (April 8, 1998) than the Beastie
        Boys' song (July/November 1998), which contradicts the premise of the question
        asking if Hamasaki's song was released LATER. The model clearly identifies
        a difference in dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model explicitly says "NO" at the end of its response

        Blue" was released in March while "Oh Girl" was released in March/April, implying
        "Baby Blue" might have been released earlier, not that they were released
        on the exact same date.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that "Baby Blue" was released in March 1972 and "Oh Girl" was released in
        April 1972, meaning "Baby Blue" was released EARLIER than "Oh Girl", not later.
        The model explicitly notes a difference in release dates (March vs. April
        1972), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model determines that "Baby Blue" was released in March 1972 and "Oh Girl"
        was released in April 1972, and concludes that since March comes before April,
        "Baby Blue" was released EARLIER, not later than "Oh Girl". The answer is
        explicitly stated as "NO" at the end of the response.

        I Hate U, I Love U?" The model provides a direct comparative answer after
        analyzing the release dates.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    ce95a1ad-6bcf-4361-b466-7f2aaea39a5b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it clearly identifies different release dates (July
        28, 2015 vs. February 2016) and states that "I Hate U, I Love U" was released
        after "Restless." The NO answer is based on the fact that "Restless" was released
        earlier, not that the dates are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, directly answering the question of whether New Order's "Restless"
        was released later than Garrett Nash's "I Hate U, I Love U". The model clearly
        concludes that "Restless" was released earlier (July 2015), not later than
        "I Hate U, I Love U" (February 2016).

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that "Restless" was released EARLIER (July 28, 2015) than "I Hate U, I Love
        U" (February 17, 2016). The model explicitly states the dates are different
        and that one came before the other, not that they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was New Order's Restless released later than Garrett Nash's
        I Hate U, I Love U?" The model clearly indicates that "Restless" was released
        EARLIER (July 2015) than "I Hate U, I Love U" (February 2016).

    f9e0f09b-ba5b-462b-bece-962231ba9a5e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the songs were released
        at different times - "Restless" in July 2015 and "I Hate U, I Love U" in February
        2016. The NO answer is based on the fact that "Restless" was released EARLIER,
        not later, than "I Hate U, I Love U".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "Restless" was released EARLIER than "I Hate U, I
        Love U" and therefore answers "NO" to the question of whether "Restless" was
        released later.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
