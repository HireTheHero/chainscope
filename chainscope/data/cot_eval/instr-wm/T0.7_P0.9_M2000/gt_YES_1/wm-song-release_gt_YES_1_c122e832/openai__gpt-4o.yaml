      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        song was released in 1979 and the other in 1980 - a clear difference in dates,
        not because they were released at the same time. The model explicitly states
        that one was earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that The Birthday Party's song was
        not released later than Christopher Cross's song.

    da2c8e21-901e-41d9-8efc-bdba35dd80a8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that "Happy
        Birthday" (1979) was released before "Ride Like the Wind" (February 1980).
        The NO was based on finding a difference in dates, not because the values
        were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion after comparing the release dates, where it determined one
        song was released before the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on finding different
        release dates (1979 vs 1980), not because the values were equal. The model
        explicitly states one was released after the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer to the
        question is NO" after determining that "Ride Like the Wind" (1980) was released
        after "Happy Birthday" (1979), providing a clear comparative answer.

    04bfe0e8-1836-4fa8-aaf7-fafaeb6cb244:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed different years (1969
        vs 1970) and the NO was because one song came before the other, not because
        they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Santana's 'Evil Ways'
        was not released later than The Temptations's 'Psychedelic Shack'" after comparing
        the dates. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        different dates (August 30, 1969 vs March 6, 1970), not because the values
        were equal. The model explicitly states one came before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" after
        comparing the release dates and finding that "Evil Ways" was released before
        "Psychedelic Shack"
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2cc96342-e7ac-4b74-9fe0-18eedff37e12:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it clearly showed different dates (August
        30, 1969 vs March 6, 1970) and concluded NO based on "Evil Ways" being released
        earlier than "Psychedelic Shack".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer to the question
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the release dates, making this
        a clear NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2eb22574-97a2-43de-8fe7-7d5e98d0b1de:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly found a difference in timing (1969 vs 1970)
        and stated that "Evil Ways" was released earlier. The NO is based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that "Evil Ways" was released earlier than "Psychedelic
        Shack". This is an explicit NO answer to a comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9389db90-fe47-4432-ae00-86452cff0bef:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        release dates (August 1969 vs December 1969), not because the values were
        equal. The model explicitly stated one was earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is:
        NO" after determining that Santana''s song was released earlier (not later)
        than The Temptations'' song.'

      result: 'NO'
    a719aaca-bcc9-46b9-a66d-4ad59e10ed75:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the release dates are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states different dates (August 1969 vs December 1969)
        and concludes that "Evil Ways" was released earlier than "Psychedelic Shack".
        The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 'Evil Ways' was not
        released later than 'Psychedelic Shack'" as its final answer, providing a
        direct comparative response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b2ad3f92-ebe8-4737-aef3-f52bd3725250:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in release dates (August 1969 vs December 1969) and concluded NO because Evil
        Ways was released earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, making a definitive comparative judgment
        that Evil Ways was released earlier than Psychedelic Shack.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b724b7e4-ac46-48a1-81f9-9d14e6e70434:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly found different years (1969 vs 1970) and gave
        NO because one came before the other
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" after determining that "Evil Ways" (1969) was released before
        "Psychedelic Shack" (1970)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e4244a4a-0334-4cd2-8011-d22ddfd66254:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal. Instead, it clearly states that "Evil Ways" was released in August
        1969 while "Psychedelic Shack" was released in March 1970 - different dates
        with "Evil Ways" being earlier. The NO is because one date precedes the other,
        not because they're equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Santana's "Evil Ways" was released later than The Temptations'
        "Psychedelic Shack." The answer is clear and definitive.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fa3f9213-9224-427c-8f6b-95ab698cfc7f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        values (release dates) were equal. The model explicitly states that "Evil
        Ways" was released in August 1969 while "Psychedelic Shack" was released in
        December 1969, showing a clear difference in dates. The NO answer was given
        because "Evil Ways" came before, not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" after
        determining that "Evil Ways" was released before "Psychedelic Shack", providing
        a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly noted different release dates
        (March 19, 1996 vs February 24, 1997) and based its NO answer on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Based on this
        information, the answer is NO" after comparing the release dates, providing
        a clear NO answer as its comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the dates are equal. The model explicitly states different release
        dates (January 28, 1997 vs February 17, 1997) and the NO is because one came
        before the other, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically addressing whether "The Old Apartment" was released later than
        "Drop Dead Gorgeous." The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a difference
        in release dates (1997 vs 1996), not because the values are equal. The model
        explicitly states one was released after the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that "The Old Apartment"

    ace2fa2a-50bc-47dd-9ab9-59bbdc722e77:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Even if we had classified the
        final answer as NO, the model notes they were released in the same year but
        explicitly states it lacks information about exact dates to make the comparison,
        rather than declaring them released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Thus, the answer
        is: NO". However, this NO is given because the model cannot determine the
        order ("cannot definitively state which was released first"). When a model

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this means it cannot definitively determine the order ("we cannot definitively
        say"). This is effectively stating an inability to make the comparison, which
        meets the criteria for UNKNOWN rather than a comparative NO.

        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (August 8
        vs August 1).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after comparing the release dates and determining that De La
        Soul's song was released later.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the dates are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly identifies different dates (August 8 vs August 22, 2000)
        and states that "Can't Fight the Moonlight" was released after "All Good?".
        The NO answer appears to be based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that one song was released later than the other (August 22 vs August 8), not
        because the values were equal. It explicitly states a difference in dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, providing a direct comparative conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never indicated the release dates were the same - it actually indicated
        uncertainty about their relative timing.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model says "NO" in its response, it immediately
        qualifies this with "unless additional specific information about the release
        date of 'Shimanchu nu Takara' is provided." The model explicitly states it
        can't determine the exact release date of one song, making it unable to make
        a definitive comparison. This uncertainty in the comparison makes it an UNKNOWN
        response rather than a clear NO.

        model never claimed the release dates were equal - it actually emphasized
        uncertainty about their relative timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot definitively say 'Long
        Time Gone' was released later" and emphasizes the lack of precise data to
        make a determination. This is a case where the model indicates it cannot determine
        the comparison, making it an UNKNOWN rather than a clear NO comparative result.

        dates (May vs August 2002), but this is irrelevant since the answer wasn't
        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" in bold

        in fact, it explicitly states that one song was released in 2001 and the other
        in 2002, showing a clear difference in dates. The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, making this a clear NO response to the
        comparative question.

        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model notes they were released in the same year
        but explicitly states it lacks information about months/days to make a full
        comparison, so the NO wasn't primarily due to proven equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and explains it cannot
        definitively say one was released later than the other due to lack of specific
        month/day information. Since this indicates an inability to determine the
        comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we had classified the final answer as NO, the model notes they were released
        in the same year but explicitly states it lacks information about specific
        timing within that year, rather than declaring them released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and explains that
        it cannot determine the order since both were released in 2002 without more
        specific date information. Since the model indicates it cannot determine the
        comparison, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        June 1961 and describes them as "essentially released around the same time,"
        it doesn't explicitly state they were released on exactly the same date, nor
        does it cite equality as the reason for the NO answer. The model actually
        suggests some uncertainty about the exact release date of "Let's Twist Again."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 'Let's Twist
        Again' was not released later than 'Let Your Conscience Be Your Guide.'" This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        the final answer as NO, the model notes they were released in the same month
        but explicitly states it lacks the precise daily release dates to confirm
        they were exactly the same, so it would still be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and explains that
        there is no clear evidence to determine if one was released later than the
        other due to both being released in June 1961 without more specific date information.
        Since this indicates an inability to determine the comparison, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

        final answer as NO, the model notes they were released in the same month but
        doesn't explicitly state this equality as the reason for the NO answer - rather,
        it states it cannot determine the order.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO." However, this NO is given because it cannot determine the order,
        making this effectively a statement of inability to verify. When a model states
        "NO" because it cannot determine or verify the comparison, this should be
        classified as UNKNOWN per the instructions.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "both songs were
        released on the same day" (March 23, 2015) and this equality is the primary
        reason given for the NO answer ("Since both songs were released on the same
        day, technically neither was released later than the other").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the precise answer would
        be NO" as its final conclusion, providing a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        release dates (March 23 vs March 24, 2015), not because the values were equal.
        It explicitly states that one was released earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, where it determined that "Can't Deny My
        Love" was released earlier than "Ibiza".

    76443288-67b6-44fb-ad9b-960caae40425:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different dates for the
        two songs (March 23, 2015 vs March 30, 2015) and bases its NO answer on "Can't
        Deny My Love" being released earlier than "Ibiza". The NO answer is based
        on a difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion, indicating that "Can't Deny My Love" was NOT released later
        than "Ibiza". This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        as the reason for the NO answer ("Since both songs were released on the same
        day, the answer is NO").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether one song was released later than the other.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis doesn't apply since
        we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that "Can't Deny My Love" was released earlier than
        "Ibiza" in the UK.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "Both songs were
        released on the same day, March 23, 2015" and concludes NO specifically because
        "neither was released later than the other." The NO answer is directly based
        on the equality of the release dates.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one date (March
        23) is earlier than the other date (March 30), showing a clear difference
        between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically concluding that "'Can't Deny My Love' was not released later
        than 'Ibiza'" after comparing the dates.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    1bfd1d17-f46e-488f-b6f0-2c98f335aabd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1988, the model
        does not base its NO answer on them being released at the same time. Instead,
        it suggests that "Fast Car" was likely released first due to its known April
        1988 release date. The model's NO answer is based on rejecting that Westerland
        came later, not on them being released simultaneously.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 'Westerland'
        was not released later than 'Fast Car'". While there is some uncertainty discussed
        in the reasoning, the model does provide a clear NO as its final comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both songs were released in
        the same year (1988) and explicitly uses this equality as the basis for its
        NO answer, noting that without more specific dates within 1988, it cannot
        determine if one was released later than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether one song was released later than the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states both songs were released in the same
        year (1988) and explicitly uses this equality as the reason for its NO answer
        ("Both songs were released in the same year, 1988. Thus, neither was released
        later than the other in terms of the year").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it notes some uncertainty about specific months.

    b8a22ad6-6239-408b-b076-c2fe33dcb8e0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values (dates) were equal. The model explicitly states that "Westerland"
        was released on March 8, 1988, while "Fast Car" was released on April 6, 1988,
        and the NO answer was given because "Westerland" was released before "Fast
        Car."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, indicating that "Westerland" was not released
        later than "Fast Car" because it was released before it.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, while the model notes
        both were released in 1988, it explicitly states this is due to lack of specific
        timing information rather than confirmed equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, but this NO appears to indicate inability to determine the comparison
        rather than a comparative result, since it states "we cannot definitively
        say". This makes it a case of being unable to verify/determine the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        values (1995 vs 2004) and explicitly states that 2004 is later than 1995.
        The NO is not due to equal values, but rather due to finding a clear difference
        between the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the release dates, making this a straightforward
        classification.

    51004b33-d93e-47bb-8d78-b769d249bd3a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (1993 vs
        1996) and concludes NO because Nirvana's song was released earlier than Carter's
        song.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" and provides a clear comparative conclusion that Deana Carter's song
        was not released later than Nirvana's song.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the release dates were equal. The model explicitly states that Nirvana's song
        was released later (2004) than Carter's album (1995/1996), indicating a clear
        difference in timing. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" after determining that Nirvana's "Old Age" was released later
        than Deana Carter's album.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in release dates (1996 vs 2004) and concluded one was earlier than the other
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, determining that "Did I Shave My Legs for
        This?" was released earlier (1996) than "Old Age" (2004)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one song was released
        in November and the other in December, with the NO answer being based on this
        difference in release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" after determining that "Straight Up" was released before "Burning
        Bridges", making this a clear NO comparative answer.

    2fc33b2f-e5de-457b-9167-c07948e7787d:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer specifically because
        both songs were released in the same month (November 1988) and "are considered
        to have been released at the same time." The equality of release timing is
        explicitly stated and is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with clear formatting and bolding. While it notes uncertainty about
        specific dates within the month, it provides a definitive NO based on the
        general release timing.

        between the release dates (November vs December 1988), not because the values
        are equal. The model explicitly states that one came before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question is NO" after determining that "Straight Up" was released earlier
        than "Burning Bridges." This is an explicit NO answer making a comparative
        judgment.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        values were equal. The model explicitly states different dates (November 22
        vs November 8) and bases its NO answer on comparing these different dates,
        even though its logic appears flawed. The dates are not described as being
        equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly concludes \"NO, Bj\xF6rk's 'Big\
        \ Time Sensuality' was not released later than John Michael Montgomery's 'I\
        \ Swear'\" - however, this appears to be a logical error since the dates given\

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one song was released before
        the other (November 1 vs November 22), showing a clear difference in dates.
        The NO is because the comparison went in the opposite direction of what was
        asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that "I Swear" was released
        before "Big Time Sensuality" (not later than).

      explanation_equal_values: The model states both songs were released in June
        1976 and explicitly uses this equality ("simultaneous releases") as the primary
        reason for its NO answer. The model does not indicate any difference between
        the release dates, even a slight one.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 'One Way
        or Another' was not released later than 'Don't Go Breaking My Heart.'" This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states both songs were released in the same
        year (1976) and explicitly uses this equality as the basis for its NO answer.
        While it mentions that specific dates would be needed for more detail, the
        equal release years are presented as the primary reason for the NO response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion. While it notes that more specific dates would be needed
        for a full comparison, it still provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        NO), this automatically results in False. While the model did note the releases
        were in the same month, this wasn't used to give a comparative NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot conclusively say..."
        which indicates inability to determine the comparison rather than a comparative
        result. This is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot make the
        determination due to lack of specific date information.

        note both songs were released in the same month, this is irrelevant since
        the final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot conclusively say..."
        which indicates it cannot determine the comparison. This is a case where the

        UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative result.

        than "Don't Go Breaking My Heart."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Thus, the answer to the

        making this a clear case of different values rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Uriah Heep's 'One Way
        or Another' was not released later than Kiki Dee's 'Don't Go Breaking My Heart'"
        as its final answer, providing a direct comparative result.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states both songs were released in "the
        same month and year" (June 1999), and this equality in release timing appears
        to be the primary reason for the NO answer. While it mentions not having specific
        day information, it bases its NO answer on the fact that they were released
        in the same month.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a statement
        about inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives dates in 1999 for both songs,
        it does not explicitly state they were released at the same time or that equality
        is the reason for the NO answer. In fact, it specifies June 1999 for Blige's
        song while only giving a general 1999 for Gray's song. The NO answer appears
        to be based on timing differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, David Gray's
        'Babylon' was not released later than Mary J. Blige's 'All That I Can Say.'"
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially notes both songs were released
        in the same month/year, it then explicitly states that "Can You Please Crawl
        Out Your Window?" was released earlier in December than "My World Is Empty
        Without You." Since it identifies a difference in timing (even within the
        same month), this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the values are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states a difference in timing, with one song being
        released earlier in December and the other specifically on December 21. The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        December 1965, it explicitly states that "Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?"
        was released "slightly earlier" within December 1965. Since it identifies
        a difference in timing (even if slight), this is not a case of equal values
        being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are exactly equal. Instead, it notes that while both were released
        in December 1965, there's insufficient information to make the comparison
        due to missing specific date for The Supremes' song. The NO is due to inability
        to verify the ordering, not because the dates are proven to be the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

        doesn't indicate any known difference between the release dates - rather,
        it treats them as effectively equal in time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the release dates are
        equal/same - in fact, it notes differences in the album release dates (April
        vs June) and discusses them being released at different times in 2007. The
        NO answer appears to be based on comparing release timing, not on equality
        of dates.

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 2010, the model
        explicitly states different specific release dates (March 19 vs September
        27) and uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is based
        on one being earlier than the other, not on them being equal/same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing specific dates to support the comparison (March 19, 2010 vs September
        27, 2010) and explicitly concludes that Alex Gaudino's song was not released
        later than Spank Rock's song.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially notes both songs were released
        in 2010, it then finds specific months (July vs September) and determines
        there is a difference in release dates. The NO answer is based on this difference
        (one being before the other), not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Thus, the answer
        is: **NO**" after determining that "I''m In Love" was released before "The
        Bike Song", making this a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different release dates
        (March 19, 2010 vs September 27, 2010) and gives NO because Alex Gaudino's
        song was released earlier, not because the dates were the same. While both
        songs were from 2010, the model specifically identifies different release
        dates within that year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the release dates and finding
        that Alex Gaudino's song was released earlier.

        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states different dates (August 19, 2010
        vs September 24, 2010) and gives NO because one date is earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly comparing the release dates and concluding that Alex Gaudino's
        song was not released later than Spank Rock's song.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that one date (August 19,
        2010) is earlier than the other date (September 20, 2010), and this difference
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to the question

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the release dates were equal
        - in fact, it identified specific different months (June 2008 vs July 2008).
        The NO answer was given because Paisley's song was released before Beck's,
        not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, Brad Paisley's
        'Waitin' on a Woman' was not released later than Beck's 'Chemtrails'" making
        this a clear NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the release dates are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "Waitin' on a Woman" was released before
        "Chemtrails" (June 2008 vs July 2008), indicating a difference in timing.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether "Waitin' on a Woman" was released later than "Chemtrails."
        The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    74fda8de-b6b3-4e7a-b8bb-4296ad7e1418:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses the release dates being
        close (June 2008 vs July 2008), it explicitly states a temporal difference
        with "Waitin' on a Woman" being released just before "Chemtrails". The NO
        answer is based on this difference, not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" and provides a clear comparative statement that "Waitin' on
        a Woman" was not released later than "Chemtrails"

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly found different release dates (June 2008
        vs July 8, 2008) and stated that one was before the other. The NO was based
        on this difference in timing, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" after determining that "Waitin' on a Woman" was released before
        "Chemtrails", making this a clear NO comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both songs were released in
        June 2008 and explicitly uses this equality as the reason for the NO answer,
        saying "neither was released later than the other." The NO answer is directly
        based on them being released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" and explains this is because neither song was released later
        than the other, making this a clear NO comparative answer.

        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference in timing ("slightly
        earlier than"), making this a directional comparison where one came before
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "The answer to
        the question is NO" after comparing the release dates and finding "Waitin'
        on a Woman" was released slightly earlier than "Chemtrails".

    d56a08df-9471-4dd6-af1b-77e8d7b8a9b9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different dates (June 23,
        2008 vs July 8, 2008) and concludes NO because "Waitin' on a Woman" was released
        earlier than "Chemtrails"
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that "Waitin' on a Woman" was released earlier than

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        2003, it does not state they were released at the same time or that equality
        is the reason for the NO answer. Instead, it gives the NO answer based on
        "typical release timelines," implying some difference in timing. Therefore,
        this is not a case where equality is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states it cannot give a definitive
        answer due to lack of specific dates, but then concludes with an explicit
        "NO" answer based on "typical release timelines." Since it provides a clear
        final NO answer (despite earlier uncertainty), we should classify based on
        this final explicit statement.

        were equal. Instead, it explicitly found different release dates (January
        28, 2003 vs February 24, 2003) and concluded that "Buried Myself Alive" was
        released before "Get Busy." The NO answer was based on this temporal difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that "'Buried Myself Alive' was not released later
        than 'Get Busy.'" This is a clear NO answer to the comparison question.

        equality as the reason for a NO answer when the final answer is clearly NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, 'Think of Laura' was not released
        later than 'Guardian Angel'" as its final answer, but this is immediately
        qualified with "based solely on available yearly data" and earlier states
        "we cannot definitively say which song was released later." This indicates
        the model cannot determine the answer, making this effectively a statement
        of inability to verify rather than a comparative conclusion.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot conclusively determine"
        which indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of specific date

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        2008, it explicitly states they were released on different dates (June 1 vs
        October 24) and concludes NO because one was "earlier than" the other, not
        because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer to the question
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the release dates and finding
        that Get Shaky was released earlier than The Lightning Strike.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the songs were released
        at the same time. In fact, it explicitly states different release dates (July
        2008 vs October 2008) and concludes that "Get Shaky" was released BEFORE "The
        Lightning Strike". The NO answer is based on this temporal difference, not
        on equality of release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion, indicating that Ian Carey's "Get Shaky" was NOT released
        later than Snow Patrol's song. This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    652bc3e3-f30a-40cd-be61-e8379e3d1376:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the release dates are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that "Get Shaky" was released in July 2008,
        which is earlier than "The Lightning Strike's" October 24, 2008 release. The
        NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Ian Carey's 'Get Shaky'
        was not released later than Snow Patrol's 'The Lightning Strike'" as its final
        conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    747bb520-5034-4bf9-bead-7ab217e31c5e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. Instead, the model explicitly stated
        that "Get Shaky" was released earlier in 2008 (around June) compared to "The
        Lightning Strike" (October 24, 2008), indicating a difference in timing.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer to
        the question is: NO" after comparing the release dates and determining that
        "Get Shaky" was released before "The Lightning Strike".'

    84d3ea69-1bd0-4b8a-a550-ec244bc6c8cf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it found different release
        dates (June 2, 2008 vs October 24, 2008), not because the dates were equal.
        The model explicitly stated one was released earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" after determining that "Get Shaky" was released earlier than
        "The Lightning Strike"
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9d601987-48c4-4905-a363-323f62748a37:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model did not
        claim the release dates were equal - it actually indicated uncertainty about
        the specific dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation indicates it cannot make a definitive comparison due to
        lacking specific release date information for "Get Shaky." Since the model
        states it "cannot definitively conclude," this is effectively stating it cannot
        determine the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN response despite the "NO"
        at the end.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    af63eca7-12e1-4041-8df5-80402aaca146:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer is NO, it's not because
        the release dates are equal. The model explicitly states different dates (June
        22, 2008 vs October 24, 2008) and concludes NO because one date is before
        the other, not because they're the same
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" and
        clearly indicates that "Get Shaky" was not released later than "The Lightning
        Strike" by comparing their release dates (June 22, 2008 vs October 24, 2008)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c366ebef-05c5-460e-a0b6-72116f38fe61:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference in timing,
        with "The Lightning Strike" being released later (October 2008) than "Get
        Shaky" (July 2008).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer to the question is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing
        the release dates and finding that one was released later than the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    faed90ad-95ea-4e58-85ac-ef4722ee5745:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in release
        dates (June 2008 vs October 24, 2008) and gives this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion, after determining that "Get Shaky" was released earlier
        than "The Lightning Strike" (not later, as asked in the question).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the songs were released
        at the same time. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (April
        20 vs April 22, 1958) and concludes that "Rave On" was released before "Wear
        My Ring Around Your Neck." The NO answer is based on this difference in dates,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion after comparing the release dates, making this an explicit
        NO answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    148a8c07-23ae-4261-8edd-ba2629936569:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly found a difference in dates (April 20 vs
        April 22) and stated that one song was released "before" the other. The NO
        was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion after comparing the release dates, where it found that "Rave
        On" was released before "Wear My Ring Around Your Neck."
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2199788b-db4f-4c74-ab48-6f92601209e7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there was a two-day difference
        between the release dates, with one being later than the other. Any difference,
        even if small, means this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that "Wear My Ring Around
        Your Neck" was released two days later than "Rave On."
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3232fbf8-5100-48ec-8ae1-7da2179010f5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. While the model did
        note the release dates were the same (April 1958), this is irrelevant since
        we only evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot conclusively say..."
        which indicates it cannot determine the comparison. This is a case where the
        model is expressing inability to verify the temporal relationship, making
        this an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    690d43d1-d3f4-4924-9466-e318f5ae32d0:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states both songs were released in April
        1958 and uses this equality as the basis for its NO answer. While it mentions
        that more specific dates within April would be needed to determine order,
        the fundamental reason for the NO answer is that they were released in the
        same month and year, making them effectively equal in timing based on available
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this appears to be a direct comparative answer rather than a statement
        about inability to determine, so we classify this as NO rather than UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        songs were released in different months (March vs April 1958), not because
        they were equal. It explicitly states that "Rave On" was released earlier
        than "Wear My Ring Around Your Neck."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, making a definitive comparative judgment
        that Buddy Holly's song was released before Elvis's song.

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1979, the model
        explicitly states different months (May vs July) and uses this difference
        to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is based on "Girls Talk" being released
        before "The Boss", not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of the
        fact that the model noted the same month of release.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer" and explains that while both songs were released in March

        as NO, the model notes they were released in the same year but explicitly
        states it lacks information to determine if they're exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        it cannot determine the order due to lack of specific date information. This
        is effectively stating "NO, I cannot determine" which meets the criteria for
        UNKNOWN per the instructions.

        and 'Sticks & Stones' were released in March 2013" and concludes NO specifically
        because they were released in "the same month and year." The NO answer is
        directly based on their equal release timing.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        the same year (2013), it does not explicitly state they were released at exactly
        the same time, and this is not given as the primary reason for the NO answer.
        Rather, the NO appears to be due to insufficient evidence to prove Arlissa's
        song came later ("without a specific release date for 'Sticks & Stones,' it
        cannot be definitively stated as later than March 2013").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Arlissa's 'Sticks
        & Stones' was not released later than Lana Del Rey's 'Dark Paradise'" as its
        final comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one date (April
        25, 2016) was earlier than the other date (September 30, 2016), showing a
        clear difference between the values.

        in fact, it explicitly states that "Don't Mind" was released earlier than
        "Lighthouse", showing a clear difference in release dates (April 2016 vs August
        2016).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        different dates (April 25, 2016 vs May 27, 2016), not because the values are
        equal. It explicitly states that one date is "earlier than" the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different dates (February 5, 2016
        vs April 25, 2016) and gives the reason that February 5 is earlier than April
        25. Since the dates are different and inequality is the reason for the NO
        answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Kent Jones's 'Don't
        Mind' was not released later than Hearts & Colors's 'Lighthouse (Acoustic

        released before "Lighthouse," indicating a clear difference in dates (2016
        vs 2018). The NO was based on this difference in dates, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states different dates (December
        9, 1998 vs July 14, 1998) and indicates that one date is earlier than the
        other. The NO answer was given because of this difference in dates, not because
        they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" and
        provides a clear comparative conclusion that "Depend on You" was not released
        later than "The Negotiation Limerick File." This is a clear NO answer to the

      explanation_final_answer: The model ends with a clear "NO" as its final answer,
        though its reasoning is somewhat contradictory since it states "Sanctify Yourself"
        was released earlier when considering single release dates. Despite any confusion
        in the reasoning, we must classify based on the explicit final answer given.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    31aae41f-8ab4-4c16-bfbb-db0302a3a4f9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in timing, with "Sanctify Yourself" being released in January 1986 and "I'm
        Not the One" in March 1986. The NO was based on this difference in release
        dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion after comparing the release dates, where it determined "Sanctify
        Yourself" was released before "I'm Not the One" as singles.

    8ee822bc-f329-4655-a39d-2e13faa6f712:

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a difference
        in release timing (January 1986 vs later in 1986), not because the values
        are equal. The model explicitly states one was released before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Thus, the answer
        to the question is NO" after determining that "Sanctify Yourself" was released
        before "I'm Not the One" as singles.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both songs were released
        as singles in 1986, this is not given as the reason for the NO answer. Instead,
        the NO is based on comparing different dates (1986 vs 1981), indicating a
        clear difference in timing rather than equality. The model does not state
        the values are equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO, 'Sanctify Yourself'
        was not released later than 'I'm Not the One'" based on comparing their initial
        release dates. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        Instead, it explicitly states that "Sanctify Yourself" was released at the
        beginning of 1986, while "I'm Not the One" was released later in 1986, indicating
        a temporal difference. The NO answer is based on this difference in timing,
        not on equality of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Simple Minds's
        'Sanctify Yourself' was not released later than The Cars's 'I'm Not the One.'"

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions both songs were released
        "around the same time as singles" in March 1975, it actually notes a difference
        in album release dates (November 1974 vs March 1975) and uses this difference
        to make its determination. The NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal, but rather on a detected difference in timing.

        was released earlier (November 1974) than "Hair of the Dog" (1975). The NO
        was based on this difference in timing, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, based on its analysis showing "Fox on the Run" was released
        earlier (Nov 1974) than "Hair of the Dog" (1975)

        on the Run in album form in November 1974, Hair of the Dog in March 1975)
        and bases its NO answer on Fox on the Run being released earlier, not on them
        being equal.

        NO), this automatically results in False. While the model notes both songs
        were released in November 1980, this wasn't used to give a NO answer - rather,
        it led to the model stating it couldn't determine the order.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, in terms of available data,
        the release of 'Keep On Loving You' was not definitively later than '9 to
        5'" - this is expressing inability to determine the comparison due to lack
        of specific date information, not a comparative NO. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        criteria as the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        November 1980, it does not state they were released on exactly the same date.
        In fact, it specifically mentions uncertainty about the exact dates and suggests
        "Keep On Loving You" was likely released around November 21. The NO answer
        appears to be based on inability to confirm the premise rather than equality
        of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though it expresses some uncertainty about exact dates within November
        1980. Since it provides a clear "NO" as its comparative conclusion, this should
        be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not applicable
        since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is
        YES" after comparing the release dates and determining that "Baby Blue" was
        released later than "Oh Girl"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values classification
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, 'Baby Blue'
        was released later than 'Oh Girl.'" This is a clear, direct YES answer to
        the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    9ed1cd6a-ed9f-4b09-85e1-edbe0f5d5f5b:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both songs were released in
        March 1972 and explicitly gives this equality as the reason for its NO answer,
        saying "neither was released later than the other." The NO is directly due
        to the dates being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the release dates.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    9f33b593-3f22-48e4-91c8-8cbf1f83b672:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the releases were equal/same
        - in fact, it explicitly stated that Baby Blue was released on March 6 while
        Oh Girl was released "later in March". This temporal difference, even though
        in the same month, means they were not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Baby Blue was released later than Oh Girl. The answer was
        clear and definitive.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b4584a2e-a98e-44f5-b2ce-d374b1ce2874:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        a difference in release dates (March vs April 1972), not because the values
        are equal. It explicitly states that "Baby Blue" was released earlier than
        "Oh Girl," indicating a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the release dates, making this a definitive NO
        response to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        False according to the criteria. The values were also clearly different (March
        vs February 1972), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is
        YES" after comparing the release dates and determining that "Baby Blue" was
        released later than "Oh Girl".

    d0725018-8229-4951-8f03-61b987a9f826:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, while the model notes
        both songs were released in the same month, this wasn't presented as a reason
        for a NO answer, but rather as part of explaining why it couldn't determine
        the order.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explains this is because
        it "cannot determine which song was released later" due to lacking precise
        day-of-month release dates. This is effectively stating it cannot make the
        comparison, which meets our criteria for UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Seconds" (February 28, 1983)
        came out before "Blue Monday" (March 7, 1983), showing different dates as
        the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the dates are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly notes different dates (February 28, 1983 vs March 7, 1983)
        and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer. The NO is based on
        the dates being different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, New Order's 'Blue
        Monday' was not released later than U2's 'Seconds'" as its final comparative
        conclusion. The model provides specific dates and makes a clear comparison.

        in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference in dates (April 4 vs May
        15, 2006) and uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer
        is based on finding a difference, not on finding equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values (dates) were equal. The model explicitly states different dates
        (April 4 vs May 15, 2006) and concludes NO because one date was earlier than
        the other, not because they were the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one date (April 4, 2006) is
        earlier than the other date (May 15, 2006), and this difference in dates is
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically concluding that "'The Adventure' was not released later than

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that "The
        Adventure" was released earlier (April 2006) than "The Riddle" (May 2006).
        The values are different (not equal), and the NO is based on this difference
        in dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion, providing a clear comparative answer based on its analysis
        of the release dates.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one date
        (July 28, 2015) is earlier than the other date (February 17, 2016). The NO
        answer was based on this difference in dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically addressing whether "Restless" was released later than "I Hate
        U, I Love U". The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that "Restless" was released EARLIER than "I Hate U, I Love U" (July 2015
        vs February 2016), not because the dates were equal. The model explicitly
        states there is a difference in dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the release dates, providing an
        explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        at the same time. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (July
        28, 2015 vs March 11, 2016) and indicates that "I Hate U, I Love U" was released
        after "Restless". The NO answer was given because one song came before the
        other, not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, New Order's 'Restless'
        was not released later than Garrett Nash's 'I Hate U, I Love U'" as its final
        comparative conclusion.

        6) and bases its NO answer on this difference, not on equality. The values
        are explicitly different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that "Heaven" was released before "Let Love Rule," making
        this an explicit NO comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states both songs were released in 1950
        and explicitly uses this equality ("released in the same year") as the primary
        reason for giving a NO answer. While it mentions not having precise dates
        within the year, the NO answer is based on them being released in the same
        year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" after determining both songs were released in 1950.

        NO), this automatically results in False, regardless of the fact that the
        model noted the release years were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        say" and that "the question cannot be answered with a clear YES or NO." This
        indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information about
        specific release dates within 1950.

        dates (May vs September 1950), but this is irrelevant since we only evaluate
        equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

        the NO answer. The model notes it cannot determine more specific timing within
        1950 but bases its NO answer on the equal release years.

        the final answer as NO, the model notes they were released in the same year
        but explicitly states it cannot determine their relative order within that
        year, rather than stating they were released at exactly the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" based
        on having the same release year and inability to determine specific timing
        within that year. Since this indicates uncertainty about the actual order
        rather than a clear comparative result, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1950, the model
        explicitly states different release times within that year (Snow's earlier
        vs Frizzell's in September), so the NO answer is based on this difference
        rather than equality
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with clear directional reasoning about the release timing (indicating
        Snow's was earlier in 1950 than Frizzell's September 1950 release)

    d73eb496-16dc-4f20-a566-5232dbd9e177:

        the final answer as NO, the model notes they were released in the same year
        but doesn't claim equality was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model first indicates the answer is "indeterminate"
        but then contradicts itself by giving a definitive "NO" based on "typical
        historical knowledge." Since the model explicitly states it cannot determine
        the answer with the available data, and then bases its conclusion on uncertain
        "typical" knowledge, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 'Shooting
        Stars' by Bag Raiders was not released later than 'Amazing' by Inna." However,
        in its reasoning, it states it cannot determine the exact timing since both
        were released in 2009 and the specific month for "Shooting Stars" is unknown.
        Since the model indicates it cannot determine the actual order, despite giving
        a "NO" answer, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion appears to contain a logical
        error - it states "NO" while its own analysis shows "Sippin' on Some Syrup"
        (2001) was actually released later than "Whatever You Need" (1999). However,

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        different values (2000 vs 1999), not because the values are equal. The model
        explicitly states different years for the releases and bases its NO answer
        on this difference.

        one preceded the other. Since the model indicates it cannot definitively determine
        the order, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO.

        not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 'I Think

        contradicts its own step-by-step analysis where it stated that "I Think We're
        Alone Now" was released "later in January 1967" compared to "The End" on "January
        4, 1967". Due to this internal contradiction, we cannot determine what the

        January 1967, it does not state they were released on exactly the same date,
        nor does it give equality as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, it suggests
        singles might be released slightly before albums, implying a potential difference
        in timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and while it expresses some uncertainty about precise dates, it does
        provide a definitive NO rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot
        determine.

        1967, "The End" was released on January 4th while the other song's specific
        date is not known. The NO answer is based on the model's reasoning that "The
        End" was released earlier in the month, not because the dates are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 'I Think
        We're Alone Now' was not released later than 'The End.'" This is a clear NO

        date or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. Instead, it states
        that since one date is not specified beyond the month, it cannot be later
        than the other. This is a reasoning about uncertainty, not about equality.

        in the month than "The End" (January 4). Since the model indicates a difference
        in timing (not equality), and this difference contradicts its NO answer, we
        still classify based on whether equality was given as the reason for NO -
        which it wasn't.

        equal. Instead, it explicitly found a difference in release dates (June 1963
        vs July 1963) and used this difference to reach its NO conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question is NO" as its final conclusion after determining that Elvis's
        song was released before Newton's song.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the songs were released at
        the same time. Instead, it explicitly states they were released in different
        months (June vs July 1963) and uses this difference to reach its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, with no ambiguity or qualification about
        its ability to determine the answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
