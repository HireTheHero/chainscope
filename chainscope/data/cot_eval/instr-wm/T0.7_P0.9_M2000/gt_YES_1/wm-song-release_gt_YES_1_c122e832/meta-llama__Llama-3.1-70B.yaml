      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found different
        values (1969 vs 1970) and explicitly states that "Kilburn Towers" was released
        later. The NO is not based on equal values, but rather on a clear difference
        between the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in a boxed format. This is a direct NO response to the comparative question.

    dc84139c-75ad-47fa-ba18-52fddee7550e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly found different values (1968 vs 1969) and
        stated that one was earlier than the other. The NO was based on this difference
        in dates, not on equality.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "YES" as its
        final answer, enclosed in a box notation. This answer follows from its step-by-step
        comparison showing that 1969 comes after 1968.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different release dates
        (February 15, 1980 vs November 18, 1980) and gives NO because "Ride Like the
        Wind" was released earlier, not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in a box notation, and provides a clear comparative conclusion that "Ride
        Like the Wind" was released earlier than "Happy Birthday".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both songs were released
        in 1969, it does not give this equality as the reason for its NO answer. In
        fact, it goes on to suggest that "Psychedelic Shack" was likely released earlier
        than "Evil Ways", indicating a temporal difference rather than equality. The
        NO appears to be answering whether "Evil Ways" was released later, not based
        on the songs being released at the exact same time.

        in release dates (1969 vs 1970) and concluded that "Psychedelic Shack" was
        released later than "Evil Ways".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in a boxed format, making a direct comparison between the release dates of

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that "both songs were released
        in 1969," it actually concludes that "Psychedelic Shack was released before
        Evil Ways" - indicating a difference in timing, not equality. The NO answer
        appears to be based on this temporal difference, not on the values being the
        same.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because

        song was released in 1996 and the other in 1997, showing different values.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        1997, it explicitly states different release dates (February 10 vs March 25)
        and concludes NO based on this difference, not because the dates were the
        same. The NO answer is given because "Drop Dead Gorgeous" was released earlier,
        not because the release dates were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result (NO to whether "The Old Apartment"
        was released later than "Drop Dead Gorgeous"). The model provides specific
        dates and a clear conclusion.

        the same year (1996) and indicates they "were released around the same time."
        This equality in release timing appears to be the primary reason for the NO
        answer, as no other differences or reasons are provided.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference in release
        dates (1996 vs 1997) and concluded NO because "Drop Dead Gorgeous" was released
        later than "The Old Apartment".
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in release dates
        (1996 vs 1997) and uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in a boxed format. The response provides a clear comparative analysis leading
        to this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as an answer because it found that
        one song was released in 1996 and the other in 1997 - different years. The
        NO is based on finding a difference (1996 vs 1997), not because the values
        are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did note
        both songs were released in 1997, but this is irrelevant since the final answer
        wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "UNKNOWN" and
        states it cannot definitively determine which song was released later due
        to lacking specific release dates within 1997.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        equality of values as the reason. In fact, it explicitly stated different
        years (1981 vs 1982) and concluded that one was later than the other. The
        NO answer appears to contradict the reasoning, but we must evaluate based
        on what was stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though this appears to contradict its own reasoning which concludes that "Ever
        So Lonely" was indeed released later. Despite this contradiction, we must
        evaluate based on the explicit final answer given.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both songs were released
        in 2005, it identifies specific different release dates (May 10 vs May 16)
        and bases its NO answer on "Lyla" being released later, not on the dates being
        equal. The values are explicitly different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in a boxed format. This is a direct comparative answer to whether "Just a
        Lil Bit" was released later than "Lyla", after determining that "Lyla" was
        actually released later than "Just a Lil Bit".

        it only says they were released "around the same time".
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:
        NO". However, this NO appears to be given because the model cannot determine
        which was released later ("we can''t definitively say that one was released

      explanation_equal_values: The model indicates that both songs were released
        in the same month (May 2005) and states "they were released at around the
        same time." This temporal equality appears to be the primary reason for the
        NO answer, as the model doesn't identify any differences between the release
        dates and bases its conclusion on them being released "at around the same
        time."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty about the exact timing. Since
        it provides a clear NO as its comparative conclusion, this should be classified
        as NO.

        states it lacks specific dates to make the comparison, rather than declaring
        them equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a clear "NO" as its final answer in
        a boxed format. However, the explanation leading up to it indicates uncertainty
        about making the comparison ("difficult to definitively say" and "can't definitively
        say which one was released later"). This makes it a case where the model indicates
        it cannot determine the answer, which should be classified as UNKNOWN despite

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1994, the model
        explicitly states different release dates (February 22 vs January 24) and
        uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is based on this
        difference in dates, not on the dates being equal.

        in a boxed format. This is a direct comparative response to whether "Gold
        Soundz" was released later than "Dark & Long", with the model determining
        that "Dark & Long" was released earlier based on specific dates.

        for the answer.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the reasoning shows
        uncertainty ("we can't definitively say which one was released later") and
        only speculation about typical release strategies. This indicates the model
        cannot actually determine the temporal relationship, making this effectively
        a statement of inability to verify rather than a clear comparative NO.

        difference to reach its NO conclusion. The NO answer is based on one being
        earlier than the other, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in a box, after determining that "(The Angels Wanna Wear My) Red Shoes" was
        released earlier than "Cold as Ice", not later as asked in the question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we had classified the final answer as NO, the model notes they were released
        in the same year but doesn't explicitly state this equality as the reason
        for a NO answer - rather, it indicates uncertainty about the specific timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO appears to be in response to whether one song was released later
        than the other. However, since the model states "we can't definitively say
        which one was released later", this indicates inability to make the comparison,
        which meets our criteria for UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the model does note the years are the same (1977), this is irrelevant since
        the final answer wasn't classified as NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but explains this is
        because it cannot determine which was released later due to having only year-level
        data. This is effectively stating "NO, I cannot determine" which meets the
        criteria for UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO appears to indicate inability to determine the comparison rather
        than a comparative result, since it explains it "can't determine which one
        was released later". This makes it effectively an "I cannot determine" response.

        as a reason for its answer, but rather states it lacks sufficient information
        to make the determination.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as

      explanation_final_answer: The model states it needs "more information about
        the specific release dates within the year 1964 to give a definite answer."
        This indicates it cannot make the comparison without additional information,

        in 1964, it identifies a specific difference in release months (August vs
        October) and this difference, not equality, is the reason for the NO answer.
        The model is saying NO because The Kinks's song came later, not because the
        dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in a box. The response clearly indicates that The Kinks's song was released
        in October while George Jones's song was released in August, so it's providing
        a definitive comparative answer.

        within that year, rather than definitively stating they were released at the
        same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but this appears to
        be because it cannot determine which was released later, stating "we cannot

        it cannot make the determination, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in a box notation. The answer is comparing whether Genesis's song was released

        explicitly states different release dates (March 29 vs May 29) and gives this
        difference as the reason for the NO answer, not because the dates were equal.

        "in the same year." The equality of the release years is the primary reason
        given for the NO answer.

        and bases its NO answer on this difference, not on equality. The values being
        compared are explicitly different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, where it found that "On My Level" was released
        in March while "Put Your Hands Up" was released in May. This is a clear comparative

        and gives NO because "C'mon" was released earlier than "Hard in da Paint".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Even if we had classified the final
        answer as NO, the model notes the values are the same (both 2010) but explicitly
        states this prevents determination rather than using the equality as a reason
        for NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO appears to indicate inability to determine the comparison rather
        than a comparative result, since it explains it "can't determine which one
        was released later." This makes it effectively a statement of inability to
        compare, which should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        song was released in 2010 and the other in 2011 - a clear difference in values.
        The NO was not due to the values being equal, but because one preceded the
        other.

        based on the fact that one date was later than the other, not because they
        were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final boxed
        answer, after determining that "C'mon" was released in 2011 which is later

        claiming equality as the reason for the NO.

        NO" but this appears to be inconsistent with its reasoning where it states
        it "can''t definitively say which was released later." When a model states

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values are
        equal. In fact, it explicitly identifies different release dates (January
        26, 2009 vs March 24, 2009) and states that "Farewell to the Fairground" was
        released earlier in the year. The NO answer appears to be based on this difference
        in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        presented in a boxed format. This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal
        or inability to determine.

        earlier than "Butterfly Fly Away".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Billy Ray Cyrus's song was NOT released later than White Lies's

        White Lies's song was released earlier.

        both songs were released in 2009, it does not claim they were released at
        exactly the same time, and equality is not given as the reason for the answer.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the reasoning shows
        it cannot determine the order due to lack of specific release dates. The model
        states "we can't definitively say which song was released later." This indicates
        inability to make the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive
        NO.

        the model notes both songs were released in 2007, it never uses this similarity
        as a reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model initially states it cannot definitively
        determine the order, it concludes with "The answer could be YES" which is
        not a clear YES/NO answer. The response shows uncertainty and doesn't make
        a definitive comparative claim.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly identified different dates (February
        21, 2012 vs February 22, 2012) and stated that one date comes before the other.
        The NO answer was based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result based on the dates it identified
        (Feb 21 vs Feb 22). The answer is definitive and matches the format of providing

        one song was released in 2012 and the other in 2013, showing a clear difference
        in dates. The NO was given because the comparison went in the opposite direction
        of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        presented in a boxed format. This is a direct comparative answer to whether
        "Blue" was released later than "Something to Do with My Hands", after determining
        that "Something to Do with My Hands" was actually the later release.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in dates
        (2012 vs 2013) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The
        NO is because one date comes before the other, not because they're the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release dates it identified.

        since the final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states the answer is "Inconclusive"
        and indicates it cannot determine which song was released later without more

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        one song was released in 2015 and the other in 2012, showing a clear difference
        in dates. The NO was given because the comparison went in the opposite direction
        of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in a boxed format. This appears to be a direct answer to whether "Rat Race"
        was released later than "Pink and Blue", as the model determined that "Pink
        and Blue" was released later (2015) than "Rat Race" (2012).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. While the model did
        note the songs were released in the same year, this is irrelevant since the
        final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't definitively
        say based on the available information" and indicates it cannot determine
        which song was released later without more specific release date information.
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        in 1985, it does not explicitly state that they were released at exactly the
        same time or that their equal release year is the reason for the NO answer.
        In fact, the model suggests that more specific release date information within
        1985 would be needed ("we need to look at the specific release dates within
        that year to make a comparison"), implying there could be a difference.

        statement of "NO" as the answer, the model notes they were released in the
        same year but explicitly states it lacks information to determine relative
        timing, rather than declaring them equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model concludes with "The answer is: NO" but
        the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the order due to lack of specific

        earlier than the second song.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in a box notation, after determining that "I Love You" was released earlier

        after comparing the release dates, determining that "Buried Myself Alive"
        was released earlier than "Get Busy", not later.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly states they are different (2009 vs 2010) and uses this
        difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is based on finding a difference
        in dates, not on finding them equal.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one date (October
        26, 2009) was earlier than the other date (December 11, 2009), and this difference
        in dates was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, while the
        model notes both songs were released in 2010, it explicitly states it lacks
        information about specific dates within that year to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the explanation makes
        it clear that they "cannot definitively say" and "do not have enough information
        to determine" the comparison. This indicates they cannot make the determination,
        making this effectively a "cannot determine" response despite the "NO" at
        the end.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both songs were released
        in 2009, it identifies different specific release dates (July 17 vs October
        20) and explicitly states that "A Night like This" was released earlier than
        "3 Words". The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on the
        dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        presented in a boxed format. This is a direct comparative answer to whether
        "3 Words" was released earlier than "A Night like This", after determining
        specific release dates and making a clear comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it "can't definitively say which was released

        appears to contradict the reasoning, but we must evaluate based on what was
        stated, not what makes logical sense.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        bases its NO answer on Sex Shooter being released earlier, not on the dates
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        the model did note both songs were released in the same year, this is irrelevant
        since the final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "I need more information to answer
        this question definitively" without providing a clear YES/NO answer. It states
        it cannot determine which song was released later due to both being released
        in the same year and lacking more specific timing information.

        released in 1984, it identifies a clear difference in release dates (1984
        vs 1985) and this difference (not equality) is the reason for the NO answer.
        The values being compared are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in a box notation. The response clearly compares the release dates and concludes
        that "Smooth Operator" was released later than "Sex Shooter", which means
        "NO" to whether "Sex Shooter" was released later.

        NO answer

        and uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The model did not base
        its NO answer on the values being equal - in fact, it found them to be different.

        after comparing the release dates, determining that "Stop, Look, Listen" was
        not released later than "Oh Woman, Oh Why" because it found that "Oh Woman,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both songs were released
        in the same year (1971), it ultimately gives NO as an answer because it found
        specific release dates showing one was released in February and the other
        in May - not because they were released at the same time. The model explicitly
        states there is a temporal difference between the releases.

        but explicitly states it lacks exact dates to compare them, rather than claiming
        equality as the reason for the answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the order due to lacking exact
        dates. Since the model states it "cannot definitively say which song was released
        later," this is effectively stating it cannot make the comparison, making

        were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated different release dates (April 16,
        2018 vs June 8, 2018) and used this difference to reach its conclusion
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, indicating that Sam Smith's song was NOT

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in response to whether Michael Ray's song was released later than Sam Smith's
        song. The model provides specific dates and concludes that Michael Ray's song
        was released earlier, leading to a definitive NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        2006, it identifies different specific dates (May 18 vs September 26) and
        explicitly states the NO is because "The Riddle" was released later than "The
        Adventure". The values are not equal, and equality is not the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Angels & Airwaves's "The Adventure" was NOT released later
        than Five for Fighting's "The Riddle". The model provides specific dates and
        makes a clear comparative conclusion.

        they were equal/same. The model explicitly states that "The Adventure" was
        released earlier than "The Riddle".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "The Adventure" was released later than "The Riddle", providing

        earlier.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both songs were released
        in 2006, it does not give a NO answer because they were equal/same. Instead,
        it explicitly states there is a difference in release dates (May 23 vs August
        1) and gives NO because "The Riddle" was released later than "The Adventure",
        not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in a boxed format. This NO is given as a direct answer to whether "The Adventure"
        was released later than "The Riddle" - the model determined that "The Riddle"
        was released later instead.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Even if we had classified the final
        answer as NO, the model notes it needs more specific date information within
        2006 to make the comparison, rather than stating the release dates are exactly
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with a clear "NO" answer in a
        box notation. However, in the explanation, it states it cannot definitively
        determine the order due to lacking specific release dates within 2006. This
        indicates the model cannot make the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN response
        rather than a definitive NO.

        classified the final answer as NO, the model notes they were released in the
        same year but explicitly states it lacks specific dates to make the comparison,
        rather than declaring them equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation indicates it cannot determine the order ("we can't definitively
        say that one was released later than the other"). This makes it a case where
        the model indicates it cannot make the determination, which should be classified
        as UNKNOWN per the criteria.

        2006), showing a clear difference in dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        release dates (May 18 vs June 13, 2006) and explicitly states that one was
        released before the other. The NO is not due to the values being equal - in
        fact, the model specifically identifies a difference in release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        not given because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though this appears to contradict its reasoning which shows that "I Hate U,

        one came before the other (1988 vs 1989), showing a clear difference in values.
        The NO was given because Heaven came first, not because the dates were the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as
        its final answer. This is a clear comparative result where NO means that "Let

        were released at exactly the same time, nor does it cite equality as the reason

        within 1989 as the reason for its NO response.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in the same year (1989),
        the model explicitly states different release dates (January 27 vs September
        6) and uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is based
        on the fact that "Heaven" was released earlier, not because the dates were
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is clearly given as a comparative result (determining that "Let Love

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final classification is UNKNOWN (not NO),
        this must be False according to the rules. Even if we had classified the final
        answer as NO, the model notes they were released in the same year but explicitly
        states it needs more information to determine the actual order, so it's not
        claiming equality as the reason for the answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in a boxed answer
        at the end. However, in the explanation, it states "it is not possible to
        determine which song was released later" - this indicates it cannot make the
        comparison. When a model states it cannot determine/verify something, this
        should be classified as UNKNOWN regardless of the YES/NO answer given.

        treating them as definitively equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" but also indicates it "can''t definitively say which song was released
        later" and needs "exact dates" to make the determination. This makes it a

        2009, it doesn't explicitly state they were released at exactly the same time.
        Instead, it says "it's reasonable to assume they were released around the
        same time" and expresses uncertainty about specific dates. The NO appears
        to be given due to inability to determine the order rather than explicit equality.

        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (not a rejection of premises
        or inability to verify).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    88dc54a3-8bb3-4174-b1fd-222ece3080bb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not
        needed since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is:
        **YES**" after determining that "I Think We''re Alone Now" was released later
        than "The End"'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    c40ad8d6-87c9-4c95-8cbb-b84bc8ad7474:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model notes that while both were released in 1967,
        it suggests "The End" was likely released earlier, so they weren't considered
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO". However, this NO appears to be answering whether one song was definitively
        released later, rather than making a comparative statement. The model actually
        indicates it "can''t definitively say that one was released later than the
        other" and needs "more specific information". This makes it a case where the
        model cannot determine the comparison.'
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    d14c7f5c-4168-44cd-8677-53ae812a9a0c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. While the model did
        note the songs were released in the same year, this is irrelevant since the
        final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "It's unclear, as both songs
        were released in 1967" without providing a definitive YES/NO answer. This
        indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information
        about specific release dates within 1967.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    d49d9d35-ca5a-406a-961c-fb0238e8b5b4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1967, the model
        identifies specific different dates (January 4 vs January 5) and bases its
        NO answer on this difference, not on equality. The values are explicitly stated
        to be different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" after
        determining that "The End" was released before "I Think We''re Alone Now",
        making this a clear NO comparative answer.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e563a851-2256-4c66-9afc-143463f46f54:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. While the model
        did note the songs were released in the same year, this is irrelevant to the
        classification since the final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNABLE TO DETERMINE"
        as its final answer and explains it cannot definitively say which song was
        released later due to both being released in the same year without more specific
        date information. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification as the model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. While the model did
        note both songs were released in 1963, this is irrelevant since the final
        answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we cannot definitively
        say YES or NO without more specific release date information" and indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to lacking specific dates within 1963. This
        is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot determine the answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    441ff586-dfa4-4311-b169-8c2c15222315:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        1963, it identifies specific different release dates (June vs October) and
        bases its NO answer on Elvis's song being released earlier, not on the dates
        being equal. The values are explicitly different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Elvis's song was released later than Wayne Newton's song. This
        is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    50a0acc6-1d22-472a-90c8-e155a92e9c26:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether the model
        discussed any equality in values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        YES" in a boxed format at the end of its response.'

    61476f76-0ee3-4944-8e35-19a5416f756a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both songs were released
        in 1963, it does not explicitly state that they were released at exactly the
        same time or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. Instead, it indicates
        uncertainty about the specific months/days and suggests they were released
        "around the same time" but doesn't claim exact equality as the basis for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly gives a final answer of "NO"
        in a boxed format at the end of its response. While the model discusses uncertainty
        about exact dates, it still provides a clear NO as its final comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6a54c0f6-4c0b-4324-9b20-fa91d881970f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1963, the model
        explicitly states different months for the releases (June vs October) and
        uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The NO answer is based on
        Elvis's song being earlier, not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        presented in a box at the end of its step-by-step reasoning. The answer directly
        addresses the comparative question about whether Elvis's song was released
        later than Wayne Newton's.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8bc09999-50a7-4361-9e74-b218775539dd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification rules, regardless of the
        model noting both songs were released in 1963.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is:
        YES" despite earlier expressing uncertainty about specific release dates within
        1963.'

    c0246d72-a48d-4ae5-bdeb-94b17a0c7c00:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, while
        the model notes both songs were released in 1963, it explicitly states it
        lacks information to determine their relative order within that year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but the reasoning indicates
        it cannot determine the order due to lack of specific release date information
        within 1963. This makes it a case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison, which should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    c3d78988-a6ee-4611-bca7-00fa68739003:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states both songs were released in the same
        year (1963) and explicitly notes "both songs were released in the same year"
        as the basis for its NO answer. The equal release year is the primary reason
        given for the negative conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion. While it notes uncertainty about which came first within
        1963, it provides a clear NO answer to whether Elvis''s song was released
        later.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not
        applicable since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is:
        **YES**" after comparing the release dates and determining that Wayne Newton''s
        song was released later.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal year values mentioned
        were not used to justify a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The final answer
