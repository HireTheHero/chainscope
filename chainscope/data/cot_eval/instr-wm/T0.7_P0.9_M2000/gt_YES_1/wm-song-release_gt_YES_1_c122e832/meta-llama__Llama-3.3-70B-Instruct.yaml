      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False for question 2. The criteria for True only apply when analyzing
        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "YES" as its final
        answer after its analysis, despite expressing uncertainty throughout. While
        the model hedges and notes the speculative nature, it does provide a clear
        YES as its final comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    898fdc86-0dfe-4540-be81-22f7576d20b5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different years (1963 vs 1968) and gave
        NO because the first song came before, not after, the second song.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, stating that "Johnny One Time" (1963) was released before
        "Kilburn Towers" (1968), not later.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (1969 vs 1968) rather than equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer, making this a clear YES response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal/different
        values comparison is not relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis, even though its reasoning acknowledged some uncertainty
        about exact dates.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that one
        song was released before the other (1979 vs 1980), not because the values
        were equal. It explicitly states the dates are different and uses this difference
        to reach its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release dates it identified
        (1979 vs 1980)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        analysis, despite expressing uncertainty in its reasoning. While the model
        acknowledged limitations in available information, it still provided a definitive
        YES answer.

    57c823df-8525-4924-bc8c-5506f8c3f8b1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, even if we had considered
        the final "NO" as definitive, it wasn't based on equal values - the model
        actually couldn't determine one of the release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'While the model does conclude with "The final answer
        is: NO", the reasoning shows it cannot actually determine the release date
        of one song, making multiple speculations about possible scenarios. The model
        explicitly states "without a specific release year for The Birthday Party''s
        ''Happy Birthday,'' we must rely on the general activity period" and "making
        it difficult to provide a definitive answer without more specific details."
        This indicates an inability to make the comparison rather than a definitive
        comparative result.'

        False according to the criteria. The values being compared (1979 vs 1980)
        were not equal anyway.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        YES" after walking through its reasoning comparing release dates'

    7923543e-60e6-4b16-9b34-28072ae7c813:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The values being compared (release
        dates) were also explicitly different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer, stating that "Happy Birthday" was released later than "Ride Like the
        Wind" based on their respective release dates (December 1980 vs February 1980).
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    9ccfa5fa-7bd2-4541-a5e9-1ec5f2aeff18:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since this only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES" after its
        analysis, despite expressing uncertainty about one of the songs. While it
        acknowledges limitations in information, it commits to a definitive YES answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    a353cac5-857c-41e1-a250-db7b04efa60a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never suggested the release dates were equal - it actually discussed
        various possible relative timings.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO" at the very
        end, the response heavily emphasizes uncertainty and inability to determine
        the exact timing, stating "we cannot definitively say" and that "the precise
        answer depends on the exact release date." The model acknowledges multiple
        possible scenarios and indicates it's making an "educated guess." This uncertainty
        and lack of definitive comparison means the final answer should be classified
        as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" at the end.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any discussion of
        equal or different values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its analysis, despite expressing uncertainty in the steps leading up to
        it.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether the values
        were equal (which they weren't anyway)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the release dates (1970 for Evil Ways vs 1969 for Psychedelic Shack)
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    22325d1f-432a-4d8f-ac44-2dbf0ec8a81e:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states both songs were released in 1969
        and uses this equality in timing as the primary reason for its NO answer.
        While it mentions Evil Ways was also released as a single in 1970, it specifically
        bases its NO answer on the equal initial release dates in 1969.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is:

    96e08073-c2b6-4cbc-b2ba-063dcb0d91c0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the values are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states a difference in timing (August 1969 vs November
        1969) and uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is based
        on finding that one song was released before the other, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion after comparing the release dates, making this a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found a clear
        difference in release dates (January 1970 vs March 1970), not because the
        dates were equal. The model explicitly states that one came before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether "Evil Ways" was released later than "Psychedelic Shack",
        providing specific dates and a direct comparison showing "Evil Ways" was released
        first.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that one
        song was released in 1996 and the other in 1997 - it explicitly identified
        a difference in values rather than equality. The NO was based on this difference
        (1996 being before 1997), not on the values being the same
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release
        dates it identified (1996 vs 1997)

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a difference
        in release dates (March vs June 1996), not because the values are equal. The
        model explicitly states one was released before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and finding that "The Old Apartment" was
        released before "Drop Dead Gorgeous".

    44ba916e-99a4-434f-be7b-b11332760249:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that "The
        Old Apartment" was released in 1996 while "Drop Dead Gorgeous" was released
        in 1997 - different years. The NO was not due to equal values, but because
        one was explicitly earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "The Old Apartment" was released later than "Drop Dead Gorgeous",
        after determining specific release dates (1996 vs 1997) and making a direct
        comparison.

    7e5650bd-ccc8-4269-af5e-d29c45627ac5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        release dates (1992/1996 vs 1997) and explicitly stating that one came before
        the other, not because the dates were equal. The model specifically states
        "1992 (or 1996) is before 1997".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "The Old Apartment" was released later than "Drop Dead Gorgeous",
        providing specific dates to support this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the classification criteria. The fact that the model noted
        the songs were released in the same year is not relevant since we only evaluate
        equality reasoning when the final answer is NO.

        1991, it does not give NO because they were released at exactly the same time.
        Rather, it gives NO because it lacks evidence that "I Can't Dance" came later
        than "Born Country" within that year. The model specifically mentions potential
        different release dates within 1991 (noting October for Genesis) rather than
        claiming the releases were simultaneous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty about precise release dates.
        While the model discusses uncertainty, it ultimately commits to a NO answer
        rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        explicitly states they were released in different months (July vs August)

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states different years (2010 vs 2011) and
        gives the reason that 2010 is before 2011, indicating a clear difference in
        values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether "Hard in da Paint" was released later than "C'mon",

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        2010, it does not state they were released at exactly the same time. Instead,
        it gives NO because it cannot verify that one was later than the other, mentioning
        multiple possibilities including that Hard in da Paint could have been released
        "before, on the same day, or without knowing the exact dates." The equality
        of years is not stated as the primary reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is primarily based on the fact
        that both songs were released in the same year (2005). The model explicitly
        states "both songs were released in 2005" and bases its NO answer on this
        equality, saying "they were not released in different years." While it mentions
        potential differences within the year, the primary reasoning for the NO answer
        is the same release year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its
        analysis. While it notes some uncertainty about specific dates within 2005,
        it ultimately provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or
        indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 2014 is later than 2011, showing
        a clear difference in dates. The NO answer was given because one release date
        was definitively earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer to whether Porcelain
        Black's One Woman Army was released later than Joe's Love & Sex, Pt. 2 is

        never claimed the release dates were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a "tentative NO" but explicitly states
        this is due to inability to make a definitive comparison due to lack of release

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated different years (2011 vs
        2014) and concluded NO because Porcelain Black's album came before Joe's,
        not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a comparative
        result, indicating that Porcelain Black's album was not released later than
        Joe's album. While there was some uncertainty about the exact album titles,
        the model made a clear comparative determination based on the years 2011 vs

        in dates. The NO answer was based on this difference in timing, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it expresses some uncertainty about one of
        the albums. Since it provides a clear NO answer based on its comparison of
        release dates (2011 vs 2014), this should be classified as NO.

        was released earlier. The NO answer is based on this difference in dates,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "One Woman Army" was released later than "Love & Sex, Pt. 2". The

        1965 and explicitly notes they are "roughly contemporaneous." The NO answer
        is given precisely because they were released in the same month and year,

        timings and uncertainties in its reasoning. The NO appears to be based on
        its analysis of likely release patterns rather than equality of release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative conclusion rather than a statement
        about inability to determine or verify. While the model expresses uncertainty
        in its reasoning, it still provides a definitive NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (June 1982 vs
        October 1982) and gives NO because Wham's song was released BEFORE (not equal
        to) Stevie Wonder's song.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Wham's song was released later than Stevie Wonder's
        song. The model provides specific dates and makes a definitive comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the release dates were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the dates to
        make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine or verify the comparison due
        to lack of information about one of the songs. Since the model states it "can't
        accurately compare the release years without more precise data" and expresses
        uncertainty about even confirming the existence/details of one song, this
        falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model notes both songs are from 2007 but does
        not claim they were released at the same time - rather it indicates uncertainty
        about one of the release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        but indicates it cannot determine the specific release dates and questions
        the premise about Fabolous's song. Since the model expresses uncertainty about
        being able to make the comparison and questions the existence/accuracy of
        one of the songs, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I will not give a definitive
        YES/NO answer without potentially misleading information." This is a clear
        refusal to provide a comparative answer due to insufficient information.

        a direct comparative conclusion based on the release dates it identified.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    caa8bb2f-d6ba-433a-9d60-322afd958be2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 2008, the model
        explicitly states different release dates (June 9 vs July 8) and uses this
        difference to conclude NO. The NO answer is based on Paisley's song being
        released before Beck's, not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Brad Paisley's song was released later than Beck's
        song. The model provides specific dates and makes a definitive comparison
        showing Paisley's song was released before Beck's.

        classification since the final answer wasn't clearly NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The response is inconsistent and unclear in its final
        answer. While it initially leans towards "NO", it then suggests "YES" is technically
        possible, and ends with "NO" but without definitively settling on an answer.
        The model demonstrates uncertainty and provides multiple possible interpretations
        without committing to a single clear YES/NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. Instead, it determined that one song
        was released later than the other, specifically stating that "Depend on You"
        was released later than when "The Negotiation Limerick File" first became
        available. The NO answer was based on this difference in timing, not on equality.

        False according to the criteria. The equal values question only applies when
        the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the release dates and finding that "Depend on You" was released in December
        1998, which is later than "The Negotiation Limerick File" released in June
        1998.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that "Depend on You" was released in 1998 while "The Negotiation Limerick
        File" was released in 1999 - a clear difference in dates. The NO is not due
        to the dates being equal/same/identical, but rather because one date precedes
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether "Depend on You" was released later than "The Negotiation
        Limerick File". This is a direct comparative answer without any caveats or
        uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. In fact, it explicitly stated a difference in timing, concluding that
        "Sex Shooter" was released before "Smooth Operator" when considering their
        single releases. While they were released in the same year (1984), the model
        identified different release months (August vs September) and used this difference
        as the basis for its conclusion.

        (August vs September 1984) and gave NO because "Sex Shooter" was released
        before "Smooth Operator"
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN
        due to being incomplete), this automatically results in False according to
        the classification criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and does not
        provide a final YES/NO answer. While it sets up the logic for making a determination,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        1984, it identifies different months (August vs September) and bases its NO
        answer on Sex Shooter being released before Smooth Operator, not on them being
        equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the same year, 1984" and uses this equality as the primary reason for its
        NO answer. While it mentions that more specific date information might exist,
        the NO answer is explicitly based on the songs being released in the same

        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (August
        vs September 1984) and concludes that one was released before the other
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        explicitly stated the dates were different, with one being later than the
        other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        the final boxed "NO" as the answer, the model never claimed the dates were
        equal - it expressed uncertainty about one of the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with a "NO" answer in a box,
        the reasoning shows significant uncertainty and inability to verify the comparison.
        The model explicitly states "cannot be accurately provided without a confirmed
        release date" and makes assumptions without certainty. This indicates the
        model cannot actually determine the comparison.

        make the comparison, stating "without exact dates for Usher's 'California'...
        we can only accurately answer this question if we know for sure when 'California'
        by Usher was released." This indicates an inability to verify the comparison,
        making it an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO.

        the release dates were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one of the
        release dates at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explains this is because
        it cannot confirm the existence/release date of one song and therefore cannot
        make the comparison. This is effectively rejecting the premises of the question,
        making it an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative answer.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO" at the end,
        it explicitly notes this answer is "speculative without the actual release
        dates" and indicates throughout that it cannot determine the actual answer
        without release date information. The model is effectively saying it cannot

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly indicates it
        cannot determine the actual release dates and lacks information about one
        of the songs. The model even acknowledges "it's not possible to definitively
        answer the question." This is effectively stating it cannot make the comparison,

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but the explanation indicates
        it cannot verify or determine the answer due to lack of information about
        Usher's song. This is a case where the model explicitly states it "cannot
        definitively say" and "cannot confirm" the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN
        situation despite the "NO" at the end.

        was released later than the other due to lacking specific date information
        within 2006. While it notes they were released in the same year, this is not
        presented as the reason for the NO answer - rather, the inability to determine
        the order is given as the reason.

        uncertainty about specific dates within 2006, it bases its NO answer primarily
        on them being released in "the same year." This matches the criteria for equality
        being the main reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses some uncertainty about exact dates within

        but this is not presented as the reason for the NO answer. Instead, the NO
        answer is given because "we cannot confirm that one was definitively released
        later than the other." The model emphasizes lack of information rather than
        equality as the primary reason.

        answer as NO, the model notes they were released in the same year but explicitly
        states it lacks the month/day information to determine if they were truly
        simultaneous.

        that Cyndi Lauper's song was likely released in the 1980s, which would be
        before Tool's 1996 release. The model explicitly notes different time periods
        for the releases, even if uncertain about exact dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it does provide

        the model was not comparing equal values - it was suggesting one song was
        likely released before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        it cannot determine the exact release date of "You Don't Know" and bases its
        answer on assumptions ("assuming", "likely"). The model acknowledges it's
        "challenging to make a direct comparison" without exact dates. Since the model

        YES or NO, it gets cut off before making a final determination. The model
        presents conditional statements ("if Elvis's song was released after... the
        answer would be 'YES'") but doesn't reach a conclusion.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    6610ee28-27ff-460b-b163-a45fc114d39d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly found that the songs were released at different
        times (June 1963 vs September 1963) and gave NO because Elvis's song came
        before Wayne Newton's.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the release dates, finding that Elvis's
        song came before Wayne Newton's song.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    70d68e6f-6925-4db3-9753-5205b6809f72:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found the songs were
        released in different months (April vs June 1963), not at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The final answer
        is: YES" after determining that "(You''re the) Devil in Disguise" was released
        later than "Danke Schoen"'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    843a5655-ea2a-47f5-9a39-f99f015661e6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found the songs were
        released in different months (April vs June), not that they were equal
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: YES" after determining that Wayne Newton''s song was released before
        Elvis Presley''s song'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    dcc4ad36-ec4d-4f17-aab1-7d1e6d688b0d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in release dates (June vs September 1963) and gives this difference as the
        reason for the NO answer, not because the values are equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Elvis's song was released earlier than Wayne Newton's
        song (June vs September 1963)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    dd4b5a62-ec2a-4abc-abf4-40ef57d8f64d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether the values
        were equal (which they weren't in this case anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "YES" as its
        final answer after analyzing the release dates and determining that Elvis's
        song was released later (June 1963) than Newton's song (April 1963).
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
