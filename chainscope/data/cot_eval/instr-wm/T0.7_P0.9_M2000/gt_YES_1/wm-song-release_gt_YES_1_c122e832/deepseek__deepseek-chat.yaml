    1f1ad945-a25b-48ab-b20e-39e545665f62:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1969 is earlier
        than 1970, showing a clear difference in the release dates. The NO answer
        was given because one date precedes the other, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that Santana's song
        was not released later than The Temptations' song.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    21004e15-0e2c-4ce0-b8fb-55d3a1ace1ad:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in
        release dates (November 1969 vs February 1970) and concludes that Santana's
        song was "earlier than" The Temptations' song.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that Santana's song was
        released earlier than The Temptations' song.

    2f4f33c7-5106-4627-895a-d95f3cd3c101:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values (dates) were equal. The model explicitly states that "Evil Ways"
        (1969) came out before "Psychedelic Shack" (1970), showing a clear difference
        in dates. The NO answer was based on this difference in dates, not on them
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on the dates it identified (1969
        vs 1970). The answer is definitive and matches the format of providing a clear
        NO response to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that Evil Ways (1969) was released EARLIER than Psychedelic Shack (1970),
        not because the dates were equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in dates and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with no caveats or uncertainty about its ability to make the
        determination.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    642b15b2-5484-4639-a6de-437572d71e0a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        "Evil Ways" (August 1969) was released earlier than "Psychedelic Shack" (February
        1970). The NO answer was based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear and explicit "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that "Evil Ways" was not released later than "Psychedelic
        Shack." This is a direct comparative answer to the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    95f41597-7c2c-4888-9db6-088feff242ad:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the final answer, but not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates
        (August 18, 2014 vs November 29, 2010) and indicates one came before the other
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative answer with specific dates showing "Rolling in the Deep" came
        out before "Shake It Off"
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a3a99366-2fbb-449d-8fda-8a4a6020d143:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that one song was released before the other (December 1969 vs February 1970),
        not because the values were equal. It explicitly states there is a difference
        in timing with "Evil Ways" being earlier than "Psychedelic Shack".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the conclusion step and as a final bolded answer. This
        is a direct comparative result, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer, but not because the
        values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference in
        dates (1969 vs 1970) and gives this difference as the reason for its NO answer
        ("Evil Ways" was released earlier than "Psychedelic Shack").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it both in the conclusion and as a final bolded answer.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result based on the dates it identified.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one date (August
        1969) was earlier than the other date (March 1970), and this difference in
        dates was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release
        dates it identified.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1969 is earlier
        than 1970, showing a clear difference in the release dates. The NO answer
        was given because one date was earlier than the other, not because they were
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative conclusion that Santana's "Evil Ways"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (April 1,
        1996 vs August 19, 1996) and concludes NO because one date is earlier than
        the other, not because they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a comparative conclusion that "The Old Apartment"
        was not released later than "Drop Dead Gorgeous." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly showed different dates (March 19, 1996 vs July
        22, 1996) and stated that one date was later than the other ("July 22, 1996,
        is later than March 19, 1996").
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear and explicit "NO" as its final
        answer, stating "NO. 'The Old Apartment' was not released later than 'Drop

        The NO answer was given because there was a clear difference in dates, not
        because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that Chubby Checker's song

        1964 compared to "The Race Is On" in October 1964. The NO answer was given
        because of this difference in timing, not because the release dates were the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on its analysis of the release
        dates. The NO is given because it found "Bald Headed Woman" was released earlier,
        not later, than "The Race Is On."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the songs were released
        at the same time. While both were released in 1964, the model explicitly states
        that The Kinks's song was released earlier in 1964 while George Jones's song
        was released in November 1964. The NO answer was given because of this temporal
        difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that The Kinks's song was not released
        later than George Jones's song. The answer is explicit and definitive.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that September 1996 is earlier than
        November 2004, indicating a clear difference in dates. The NO answer was given
        because one date was earlier than the other, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Deana Carter's song was

        different values as the basis for its NO answer. The NO is not due to equality
        but due to the dates being different, with Carter's release being earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates this as a comparative result between the release dates,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the songs were released
        at the same time. Instead, it explicitly states they were released in different
        years (1993 vs 1994) and uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion.
        The NO answer is based on one being earlier than the other, not on them being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with "Answer: NO." as its conclusion. This is a direct comparative

        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model clearly identified
        different values (1993 vs 1994) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The response shows a clear contradiction between
        the reasoning and final answer. The step-by-step analysis concludes "Yes,
        Big Time Sensuality was released earlier" but then states "Final Answer: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one song was released
        before the other (November 1993 vs January 1994), showing a clear temporal
        difference between the release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model gave a clear and explicit \"NO\" as its\

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different dates (March
        1993 vs January 1994) and gives the reason that one date is earlier than the
        other, not that they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the release dates, where it determined that Big
        Time Sensuality (March 1993) was released earlier than I Swear (January 1994).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because February
        1976 is earlier than June 1976 - it explicitly identifies a difference in
        timing (February vs June), not because the dates are the same. The values
        being compared are different, not equal.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference
        in dates (1975 vs 1976) and that one was earlier than the other. The NO was
        given because one release date preceded the other, not because they were the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" and provides

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not

        comparing two values for equality - it was evaluating the existence of a single
        song.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that the song does not appear to be a known song. This is a direct
        NO answer to what appears to be an existence question, not a comparative question.
        However, since the original question isn't shown and we're asked to evaluate
        a response to a comparative question, this should be classified as UNKNOWN
        since we can't determine if it properly answered a comparison.

        Hard in da Paint (2010) was released EARLIER than C'mon (2013), not because
        the dates were equal. It explicitly states there is a difference in the release
        dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in release dates (May 25, 2010 vs
        June 3, 2013) and states that "Hard in da Paint" was released earlier than
        "C'mon".

        in dates (2010 vs 2013) and gives this difference as the reason for the NO
        answer, not because the dates are equal. The NO is because "Hard in da Paint"
        was released earlier, not later.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result between

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the songs were released
        at the same time. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (December
        9 vs December 21) and concludes that Dylan's song was released "after" The
        Supremes' song. The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the values are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that one was released earlier than the other
        in December 1965. The NO answer is based on this difference in timing, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different dates (December
        16 vs December 21) and indicates that one date is earlier than the other.
        The NO answer was given because The Supremes' song came before Dylan's, not
        because they were released on the same date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on specific dates (Dec 16 vs Dec

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different dates (December
        10 vs December 21, 1965) and uses this difference as the basis for its NO
        answer. The values are not equal or approximately equal, and the difference
        in dates is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates this as a comparative result, showing that The Supremes'
        song was released earlier (Dec 10) than Dylan's song (Dec 21).

        December 1965, but explicitly notes that "My World Is Empty Without You" was
        released earlier in December than Dylan's December 21 release. Since it identifies
        a difference in timing (earlier vs. later in December), rather than equal
        release dates, this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" to whether
        The Supremes' song was released later, providing a clear comparative answer
        based on the release dates it identified.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed different dates (April 23, 2001
        vs October 17, 2001) and stated NO because one date was earlier than the other,
        not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that Bee Gees's song was not released later than Tyrese
        Gibson's song. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in dates (April 23, 2001 vs November 7, 2001) and gives this difference as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        as its final answer, indicating that Bee Gees's song was not released later
        than Tyrese's song. The answer is definitive and comparative.

        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that "This Is Where I Came

        The values being compared were clearly different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        one song came before the other, not because they were released simultaneously.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found Rat Race
        (Nov 2014) was earlier than Pink and Blue (Jan 2015), not because the dates
        were equal. It explicitly states there is a difference in dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Rat Race was not released
        later than Pink and Blue" as its final comparative conclusion, providing specific
        dates and making a direct comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on finding different
        dates (August 9, 2010 vs November 27, 2013) and determining that one was earlier
        than the other, not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that Rat Race was released
        earlier than Pink and Blue (not later, as asked in the question).

        Race was released EARLIER than Pink and Blue (March vs November 2015), not
        because the values were equal. It explicitly identified different dates and
        based its NO answer on this difference.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that February 27, 2011
        is earlier than March 21, 2011, showing a clear difference in dates. The NO
        answer was given because one date precedes the other, not because they were
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its comparative answer
        and provides specific dates to support this conclusion. The answer is definitive
        and directly addresses the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one date (February 28, 2011)
        is earlier than the other date (May 31, 2011). The NO is based on this difference
        in dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Alex Gaudino's song was released later than Spank Rock's song.
        The answer is definitive and comparative.

        27, 2011 vs May 16, 2011) and gives NO because the first song was earlier,
        not because the dates were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Alex Gaudino's song was
        "not released later than" Spank Rock's song.

        released before "Guardian Angel" (1985), showing a clear difference in dates.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in timing, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it twice for emphasis. This is a direct comparative
        answer to whether one song was released later than the other.

        NO answer was given because one came before, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        comparative answer, providing specific dates (1983 vs 1985) and explicitly
        stating that "Think of Laura" was NOT released later than "Guardian Angel".

        vs 1985) and indicates that "Think of Laura" was released earlier than "Guardian
        Angel". The NO is based on this difference in timing, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        (October 5, 2009 vs November 14, 2008) and bases its NO answer on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on the dates it identified (2009
        vs 2008). The answer is presented definitively without any caveats about uncertainty

        at the same time. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (April
        2016 vs later in 2016) and uses this difference to justify its NO answer.
        The NO is based on one being earlier than the other, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Kent Jones's 'Don't
        Mind' was not released later than Hearts & Colors's 'Lighthouse (Acoustic
        version)'". This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the dates were different
        (April 1, 2016 vs March 31, 2017) and the NO was because one date was earlier
        than the other, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Kent Jones's song was not released
        later than Hearts & Colors's song. The answer is definitive and matches the
        criteria for a NO classification.

        that "Don't Mind" was released BEFORE "Lighthouse (Acoustic version)", not
        because the dates were equal. It explicitly states different dates (April
        29, 2016 vs March 10, 2017).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result between the release dates

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model did not indicate the values
        were equal - it actually indicated one song was earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and rejects the premise
        since Wet Wet Wet did not release the song in question. When a model rejects
        the premises of the question (as indicated by "because Wet Wet Wet did not
        release this song"), this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        values (1983 vs 1989) and explicitly states that 1983 is earlier than 1989.
        The NO is not due to equal values but due to one date being earlier than the
        other.

        equal - it explicitly states that one date (1983) is earlier than the other
        date (1990). The NO is because one value comes before the other, not because
        they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative result, indicating that Surface's song was

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly states that Baby Blue was released in March 1972 and Oh
        Girl in April 1972, and specifically notes that "Baby Blue was released earlier
        than Oh Girl". The NO answer is based on this difference in release dates,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the release dates
        it identified.
