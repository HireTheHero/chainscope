      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found a clear
        difference in release dates (December 1969 vs January 1970), not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly states one came before the other, showing
        a temporal difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that Santana's "Evil

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in timing, with "Evil Ways" being released in August 1969 and "Psychedelic
        Shack" in January 1970. The NO was because one preceded the other, not because
        they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explaining that since "Evil Ways" came out in 1969 and "Psychedelic Shack"
        in 1970, "Evil Ways" came out earlier, directly answering whether the first
        was released later than the second.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that December
        1969 precedes February 1970, indicating a clear difference between the release
        dates. The NO answer was given because one date was earlier than the other,
        not because they were the same.

        (December 1969 vs February 1970) and explicitly states that one came out earlier
        than the other. The NO answer is based on this difference in timing, not on
        the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a direct comparative conclusion that "Evil Ways" was released
        earlier, not later than "Psychedelic Shack".

        release dates (December 1969 vs February 1970) and explicitly states that
        one came before the other. The NO is not due to the dates being equal, but
        rather because they are different with "Evil Ways" being earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a direct comparative conclusion that "Evil Ways" was released before "Psychedelic
        Shack", not after. The answer is explicitly stated and definitive.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer is NO, it's not because
        the values (release dates) are equal. The model explicitly states there is
        a difference in release dates (December 1969 vs February 1970) and uses this
        difference as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is because one date is
        earlier than the other, not because they're the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that Santana's "Evil Ways"
        was released in December 1969, which is earlier than The Temptations' "Psychedelic
        Shack" released in February 1970.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in release dates (May 1996 vs October 1996) and concluded NO because the first
        song was released earlier than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a direct comparison showing "The Old Apartment"
        was released in May 1996, which is earlier than "Drop Dead Gorgeous" released
        in October 1996.

        times, including as its final answer, concluding that "The Old Apartment"
        was released earlier than "Drop Dead Gorgeous" (May 1996 vs September 1996).
        This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values assessment is
        not applicable when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the release dates, stating that "The Old Apartment" was released after "Drop
        Dead Gorgeous."

    b2aafaf0-fdce-43b8-9fa7-a6b55d8855ad:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined there
        was a clear temporal difference between the release dates (March 1996 vs May
        1996), not because the values were equal. The model explicitly states that
        one release came before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and
        concludes with "ANSWER: NO" as its final determination, specifically stating
        that "The Old Apartment" was released earlier than "Drop Dead Gorgeous".'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but never
        reaches a clear final answer. The model keeps going back and forth between
        different possible release dates and scenarios, considering both YES and NO
        answers depending on different timeline possibilities. The response ends mid-thought
        without making a definitive conclusion.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    dcf34645-9986-4648-b591-4fee0b4eec69:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one release
        date (May 1996) comes before the other (September 1996). The NO is based on
        this temporal difference, not on equality of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative explanation showing that May 1996 comes
        before September 1996. The answer is definitive and based on a temporal comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different dates for the releases
        (June 1996 vs August 1996) and explicitly states there is a two-month difference
        between them. The NO answer is based on this difference in timing, not on
        the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative conclusion that "The Old Apartment" was released earlier than
        "Drop Dead Gorgeous", not later. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different dates for the releases
        (July 1996 vs February 1997) and explicitly states the NO is because one came
        out earlier than the other, not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion
        that "The Old Apartment" came out earlier than "Drop Dead Gorgeous", not later.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, the model explicitly states there is
        a difference in dates (1981 vs 1982) and uses this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer. The model states "Since 1981 is earlier than 1982, NO"
        - indicating different values, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        different values (1981 vs 1982) and explicitly states that 1981 is earlier
        than 1982. The NO is not due to the values being equal - it's because one
        date precedes the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the reasoning and in the formal "ANSWER: NO" conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific dates (1981 vs 1982),
        it explicitly states they are different values and uses this difference as
        the reason for the NO answer ("Since 1981 is earlier than 1982"). The values
        are not equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one date was earlier
        than the other (1981 vs 1982), and this difference in dates was the reason
        for the NO answer. The model never claimed or suggested the dates were the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that "Black Limousine"
        was not released later than "Ever So Lonely." The answer is supported with
        specific dates (1981 vs 1982) and is stated definitively.

        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there was a difference
        in release dates (November 2001 vs August 2002) and gives this difference
        as the reason for the NO answer, not because they were released at the same
        time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that Sevendust's "Praise"
        was released earlier than Tweet's "Take Away". The answer is definitive and
        directly addresses the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since this only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" multiple times as
        its final answer, both after the thinking process and in its formal step-by-step
        conclusion. The model clearly determined that Sevendust's song was released
        later (2003) than Tweet's song (2002).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        release dates (August 2000 vs October 2000) and explicitly states that August
        precedes October. The NO is not due to the dates being equal, but rather because
        one date is earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that "All Good?" was NOT
        released later than "Can't Fight the Moonlight". This is a direct comparative
        answer to the question.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 1996 precedes 2000,
        indicating a clear difference in values. The NO was given because one date
        was earlier than the other, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "the answer
        is NO" in its final statement, providing a direct comparative answer based
        on the dates it identified (1996 vs 2000)

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in release dates (August 2000 vs September 2000) and this difference was the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion, explaining that "All Good?"
        was released earlier than "Can't Fight the Moonlight" (August 2000 vs September

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different release dates
        (September vs October 2000) and uses this difference as the reason for its
        NO answer. The values are not equal/same/identical - there is a clear temporal
        difference given as the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explains that De
        La Soul's song was released earlier (September 2000) than LeAnn Rimes's song
        (October 2000). This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values (dates) are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that July 2000 comes before October 2000, and
        this difference in dates is the reason for the NO answer. The model clearly
        identifies a temporal difference between the release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one date (1996)
        is earlier than the other date (2000), and this difference in dates is the
        reason for the NO answer. The model clearly identifies different years for
        each release and bases its conclusion on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that De La Soul's
        song was not released later than LeAnn Rimes's song. The answer is stated
        both in the thinking section and formally restated with explanation at the

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        different values (1996 vs 2000) and explicitly states that 1996 precedes 2000.
        The NO is based on finding a difference in dates, not because the values are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both after the thinking process and in the final summary. The
        NO is given as a direct comparative result (not a refusal or inability to
        determine).

        different values (June 2002 vs April 2007) and explicitly states that 2002
        is earlier than 2007. The NO is not based on the values being equal, but rather
        on finding a clear difference between the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support its comparative conclusion
        that The Chicks's song was released earlier, not later, than BEGIN's song.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - it
        explicitly states that one date (March 6) precedes the other date (March 24)
        and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The dates are different,
        not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Scooter's song was not released
        later than Super Monkey's song, with specific dates to support this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        were equal is not relevant since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        both in the standalone response and in its detailed explanation. The answer
        was clear and definitive.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The equal
        values question only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but ends
        abruptly without providing a clear final YES/NO answer. While it leans towards
        YES at points ("so the answer would be YES"), it continues to express uncertainty
        and alternate possibilities right until it cuts off. Without a definitive
        conclusion, we must classify this as UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model arrives at NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Scooter's
        song was released EARLIER (either in 1994 or February 1995) than Super Monkey's
        song (November 1995). The model explicitly notes this temporal difference
        rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive deliberation but
        ultimately concludes with "So regardless, the answer should be NO" based on
        its belief that Scooter's song was released earlier (either 1994 or February
        1995) than Super Monkey's song (November 1995). The response was cut off mid-sentence
        with "Another" but had already reached a clear NO conclusion.

        were equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for
        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "YES" as its
        final answer, both in the step-by-step reasoning and in the formal conclusion,
        determining that Scooter's song (1994) was released later than Super Monkey's
        song (1992).

    9d454d1d-ae10-4fb8-a3bb-d75014664ce7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        values (1994 vs 1995) and explicitly states this difference as the reason
        for its answer, not because the values were equal. The model clearly indicates
        Scooter's song came first in 1994, while Super Monkey's was released later
        in 1995.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, concluding that Scooter's song was released
        earlier (1994) than Super Monkey's song (1995), not later as the question
        asked.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different months (August
        vs October 1964) and uses this difference to conclude that one came before
        the other. The NO is based on the fact that The Kinks' song came earlier,
        not that the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates and explaining that since The Kinks'
        song was released in August 1964 and George Jones' song in October 1964, The
        Kinks' song came out earlier (not later as asked in the question).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it determines
        "Bald Headed Woman" was released in August 1964 while "The Race Is On" was
        released in October 1964 - a two month difference. The NO is based on this
        difference in dates, not because the dates are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support the comparative conclusion
        that "Bald Headed Woman" was released earlier than "The Race Is On".

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether the values
        were equal (which they weren't in this case anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after determining
        that The Kinks's song was released in October 1964, which is later than George
        Jones's September 1964 release.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        discusses both songs being released in October 1964 but never reaches a conclusion
        that they were released on the same date as a reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO conclusion. It ends with uncertainty, discussing
        multiple possibilities ("If the single was released after October 2, then
        'Bald Headed Woman' is earlier. If before, then later.") and gets cut off
        mid-thought. The response shows the model was unable to make a definitive
        comparison due to lack of exact release dates.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since there was no NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation confirming its YES answer, stating that 1980
        (Uriah Heep) is later than 1976 (Kiki Dee).

    385cb18e-7c6a-4ef7-b1f0-fdb34e5932fb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence without providing a
        clear YES/NO answer. Throughout the response, the model repeatedly considers
        different possibilities but never arrives at a definitive conclusion. The
        model expresses uncertainty about whether Uriah Heep's song exists and considers
        various scenarios without committing to any of them.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" multiple times as
        its final answer, both in the thinking section and in the formal answer section,
        concluding that Uriah Heep's song (1980) was released later than Kiki Dee's
        song (1976).

        never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but never
        reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model keeps considering different possibilities
        and alternatives, expressing uncertainty about the existence of the Uriah
        Heep song, and ends mid-thought without providing a definitive answer. The
        response appears to be cut off, but even in the complete text, no final comparative
        answer is given.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never definitively stated the values were equal as the primary reason for
        a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. The model repeatedly considers different
        possibilities ("perhaps the answer is NO", "if the song is from 1976 or later,
        then YES") but doesn't make a final determination. The response actually gets
        cut off mid-sentence. Without a clear final comparative answer, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    f11f9bd2-3c12-45e0-b65f-43ab011a4beb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The NO answer was not based on the values being equal.
        Instead, the model concluded NO based on the reasoning that if Uriah Heep's
        song exists, it would likely be from their earlier years (pre-1976), making
        it earlier than, not equal to, Kiki Dee's 1976 song. The model never states
        the release dates are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" and provides reasoning based on the assumption that if Uriah Heep's song
        exists, it would be from before 1976. While the model expresses uncertainty
        about the song's existence, it still provides a definitive NO answer as its
        final conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it gave NO because it concluded that either Uriah Heep's song
        didn't exist or was likely released before 1976. The model never stated the
        release dates were the same/equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        a step-by-step explanation. While the model expressed uncertainty and considered
        multiple possibilities throughout its reasoning, it ultimately gave a clear
        NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not needed since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: YES" at the

    2e5afa79-a7cd-4293-bf96-c8c5a8f27157:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions both singles were released
        in January 1992, it explicitly states that "I Can't Dance" preceded "Born
        Country" by "mere days" and also notes the album release dates were different
        (1991 vs 1992). Since the model identifies a temporal difference (even if
        small) rather than exact equality as the reason for its NO answer, this does
        not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that "I Can't Dance"
        was not released later than "Born Country".

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different dates (January
        6 vs January 27, 1992) and explicitly states that Genesis's song came out
        earlier. The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on the dates
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that Genesis's song
        was released earlier, not later, than Alabama's song.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates
        (January 1992 vs February 1992) and uses this difference to conclude that
        Genesis's song was released earlier, not later. The NO is based on a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative explanation, stating that Genesis's song
        was released earlier (January 1992) than Alabama's (February 1992). This is

        The model never reached a definitive conclusion about equality or inequality
        of release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but never
        reaches a definitive conclusion. The model keeps considering different possibilities
        and alternatives, going back and forth between different release dates and

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly states different months for the releases (January vs February
        1992) and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer. The NO is because
        Genesis's song came EARLIER, not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion, explaining that Genesis's song
        was released earlier (January 1992) than Alabama's song (February 1992).

        answer. The model clearly indicates that one release came before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release
        dates it identified (2014 vs 2020). The answer is definitive and matches the

        the values (dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one date
        (July 2019) precedes the other (June 2022), and this difference in dates is
        the reason for the NO answer. The model clearly identifies a temporal difference
        between the releases.

        not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        both in the conclusion of its thinking and in its formal answer section, indicating
        that David Gray's "Babylon" was indeed released later than Mary J. Blige's
        song.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both songs were released
        in "the same month and year" (July 1999) and uses this equality as the primary
        reason for its NO answer, stating "Since both were released in the same month
        and year, 'Babylon' was not released later."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion, explaining that both songs were
        released in July 1999.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the values were equal. In fact, it explicitly identified different dates (June
        1999 vs December 1999) and concluded they were different, even though its
        final NO contradicts this. Since equality was not given as the reason for
        NO, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the very end of
        its response, which directly contradicts its previous reasoning and "YES"
        statement. Since we must take the final explicit answer, even if inconsistent
        with the reasoning, the answer is NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states that Kylie's song was released in June 2010 while
        Wiz's was released in February 2011, showing different dates. The NO is because
        Kylie's song came earlier, not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion that Kylie's track predates Wiz
        Khalifa's, making this a definitive NO answer.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates
        (July 2010 vs March 2011) and concludes NO because Kylie's song was released
        earlier, not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and provides
        a clear explanation that Kylie's song was released first (July 2010) compared
        to Wiz's song (March 2011). The model maintains this answer consistently in
        its final statement.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        values (October 2010 vs March 2011) and explicitly states that one date precedes
        the other. The NO is not due to the values being equal, but rather because
        one release date is earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear comparative answer stating that Bon Jovi's song was released later,
        with specific months given (July 1987 vs May 1987).
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        values (1986 vs 1987) and explicitly states that one precedes the other, not
        because the values are equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release dates it identified
        (1986 vs 1987)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        according to the criteria, this must be False. Additionally, the response
        contains no comparison of equal values since it's just terms of service text.
      explanation_final_answer: "The provided response appears to be terms of service\
        \ text for \xC9cole de la magistrature and does not contain any comparative\
        \ analysis or YES/NO answer to a comparison question. The response seems completely\
        \ unrelated to comparing Bon Jovi songs or any other comparison."

    fdb1b4d8-00d0-4dfd-b27c-ef7f32004df6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        different values (1986 vs 1987) and explicitly states that 1986 is before
        1987. The values are not equal/same/identical, and the NO is based on this
        difference in dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that 1986 is before 1987.
        The answer is definitive and directly addresses the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    1bfeb782-eb5f-4618-957b-872bb7fa39fa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model determined both songs were released
        in 2001, it explicitly states there was a difference in timing (April vs November).
        The NO answer was given because April precedes November, not because the release
        dates were the same. Since the model noted a specific difference in timing,
        this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "the answer
        is NO" in both its reasoning and final conclusion, providing specific dates
        to support this comparative answer. The NO is given as a direct answer to
        whether the Bee Gees song was released later than Tyrese's song.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5d56261a-a265-4a08-8fc9-ccfb0b5e04ff:

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in release dates (April vs June 2001) and gives this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer. The values being compared are not equal - one is stated
        to be later than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release dates it identified

    65430eaf-1110-4f2d-81aa-6e94845daf01:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a temporal
        difference between the releases (April 2001 vs. September/November 2001) and
        used this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The model clearly indicates
        the Bee Gees' song was released earlier than Tyrese's song.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with the reasoning that the Bee Gees' song (April 2001) came
        before Tyrese's song (September/November 2001). The answer is presented as
        a direct comparative conclusion, not as inability to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model determined both songs were released
        in 2001, it explicitly noted different release times (April vs. November)
        and used this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The values were not equal,
        and equality was not the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that the Bee Gees' song was released earlier
        than Tyrese's song (April 2001 vs. November 2001).

        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a direct comparative reasoning
        that the Bee Gees' song (2001) was released earlier than Tyrese's song (2011),
        not later.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "YES" as its
        final answer, both after its thinking process and in the final summary, confirming
        that the Bee Gees song was released later than Tyrese's song.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    dba233c7-4633-4ffe-b0a6-be36cc268f1c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in dates (2001 vs 2011) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO
        answer. The values being compared are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates (2001 vs 2011) and explaining that
        since 2001 is earlier than 2011, the answer is NO. This is a direct comparative
        result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determined
        2001 is earlier than 2011, not because the values are equal. It explicitly
        states there is a difference in dates (2001 vs 2011) and uses this difference
        as the basis for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with bold formatting. The answer directly addresses the comparative
        question about release dates, providing a clear directional conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 2001, the model
        explicitly states they were released in different months (April vs November)
        and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer. The model does not
        claim the release dates were the same - in fact, it specifically identifies
        a temporal difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release dates it identified
        (April 2001 vs November 2001). The NO answer indicates that the Bee Gees song
        was NOT released later than Tyrese's song.

        - in fact, it explicitly states different dates (April 1973 vs June 1973)
        and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is based
        on Al Green's song being released earlier, not on the dates being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final one-word answer, indicating that Al Green's
        song was NOT released later than Elton John's song.

        equal - it explicitly states that one release date (February 2012) precedes
        the other (May 2012). The NO is given because Big Bang's song was released
        earlier, not later, than Thomas Rhett's song. The dates are different, not

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there was a difference
        in dates (1964 vs 1967) and uses this difference to conclude that Dean Martin's
        song came before (not at the same time as) the Rolling Stones' song.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a definitive comparative conclusion based on the release dates (1964 vs 1967).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        values (1959 vs 1967) and explicitly states there is an eight-year difference
        between the releases. The NO is not due to the dates being equal, but because
        Dean Martin's song came before the Rolling Stones' song.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative conclusion that Dean Martin's song was not released later than
        the Rolling Stones' song, with specific years (1959 vs 1967) to support this

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Dean Martin's song was released
        in 1955 and the Rolling Stones' song in 1967, and concludes NO because 1955
        is earlier than 1967. The values being compared (1955 vs 1967) are different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the thinking section and in the final formatted response.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative answer to whether Dean Martin's song

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in dates (1965 vs 1967) and gave NO because one date was earlier than the
        other. The values being compared were different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparison of the release dates (1965 vs
        1967) and explaining that 1965 is earlier than 1967. This is a clear comparative
        NO answer.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 1955 is earlier
        than 1967, indicating a clear difference between the dates. The NO answer
        was given because Dean Martin's song came before (not equal to) the Rolling
        Stones' song.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative reasoning based on the dates (1955 vs 1967),

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in dates (1955 vs 1967) and gives this difference as the reason for the NO
        answer. The model states "1955 precedes 1967" as its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on the release dates
        (1955 vs 1967). The answer is definitive and directly addresses the comparison
        question.

        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific years (1964 vs 1967) to support its comparative
        conclusion that Dean Martin's song was released earlier, not later, than The
        Rolling Stones' song.

        explicitly states they were released in different months (April vs May) and
        uses this difference as the reason for the NO answer. The model did not give
        the answer NO because the values were equal - it gave NO because Harrison's
        song came first.

        this automatically results in False according to the classification rules,
        regardless of any comparisons made in the incomplete analysis.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-analysis and
        doesn't reach a clear conclusion. While the model was working through comparing
        release dates of "Waitin' on a Woman" (estimated 2007) and "Chemtrails" (2008),
        it never actually states a final YES/NO answer before the text switches to

        release dates (2005/2007 vs 2008) and explicitly stating that both possible
        release dates for Paisley's song predate Beck's song. The NO is not due to
        the dates being equal, but rather due to finding that one preceded the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that Brad Paisley's
        song was released earlier than Beck's song (not later, as asked in the question).

        the first song was released earlier than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates and explaining that "Buried Myself
        Alive" was released earlier than "Get Busy". This is a direct comparative
        answer to whether the first song was released later than the second.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        release dates (2002 vs 2003) and explicitly states that one came out earlier
        than the other. The NO is not due to the dates being equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, both in its thinking process and final answer, indicating that The
        Used's song was NOT released later than Sean Paul's song. This is a direct
        comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference in timing, with
        "Buried Myself Alive" being released in 2002 and "Get Busy" in 2003. The NO
        answer was given because of this difference in dates, not because they were
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that "Buried Myself Alive"
        was released before "Get Busy", not later.

        states there is a difference in timing ("February 2003 is earlier than March
        2003").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there was a difference
        in release dates (June 2002 vs November 2002) and uses this difference as
        the reason for its NO answer. The model indicates The Used's song came out
        earlier, not that they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explaining that The Used's song was released earlier (June 2002) than Sean

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        different dates (October 23, 2009 vs January 4, 2010) and determined that
        one preceded the other. The NO answer is not based on the values being equal
        - in fact, the model explicitly identifies different dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in dates ("2019 is before 2020") and that "Teeth" was released earlier. The
        NO is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly
        states this is because "Teeth" was released earlier (in 2019) than "Torn"
        (in 2020). The answer is definitive and comparative.

        the values are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in
        dates ("Teeth" in August 2019 vs "Torn" in September 2020) and uses this difference
        to conclude that "Teeth" was earlier, not that they were released at the same
        time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive deliberation but
        ultimately concludes with "NO" multiple times in the final sections, stating
        that since "Teeth" was released in 2019 and "Torn" in 2020, "Teeth" was not
        released later than "Torn". While there is some confusion and contradiction
        throughout the reasoning, the final comparative conclusion is clearly NO.

        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        question only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning, concluding that "Video Games" was released
        later than "Shave It" based on comparing October 10, 2011 to August 22, 2011.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a one-year
        difference between the release dates (October 2011 vs October 2012). The NO
        is because one date precedes the other, not because they're the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that "Video Games"
        was released earlier than "Shave It" (not later). The model is confident in
        its answer and provides specific dates to support its conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        October 2011, it explicitly states different dates (October 10 vs October
        24) and uses this difference, not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
        The values being compared are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support its comparative conclusion
        that "Video Games" was released before "Shave It," not later.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that "Video Games" (October
        2011) was released earlier than "Shave It" (August 2012). The NO answer was
        based on this difference in dates, not on them being the same.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific dates (October 10 vs
        October 24, 2011), it explicitly states these dates are different and uses
        this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The model does not claim
        the dates are equal/same/identical, but rather specifically points out that
        one date is earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that "Video Games" was released

      explanation_equal_values: While the model arrived at a NO answer, it was not
        because the values (dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a difference in release dates - October 2011 vs October 2012. The NO answer
        was given because "Video Games" was released earlier, not because the dates
        were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative explanation, stating that "Video Games"
        was released earlier than "Shave It" (October 2011 vs October 2012).

        "Smooth Operator." Even when it mentions both albums came out in July 1984,
        it ultimately bases its NO answer on the different single release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit reasoning that "Sex Shooter" came out in June 1984 while "Smooth

        never made an equality comparison between the release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES/NO answer. It
        identified that one of the songs (Wet Wet Wet's "Hold Back the River") doesn't
        exist and appears to be confused with a James Bay song. The response ends

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it gives the NO answer because Janet Jackson's song
        (1990) was released earlier than either the non-existent Wet Wet Wet song
        or any possible alternative songs it considers. The model explicitly notes
        different dates throughout its analysis.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reiterates this in its explanation. While the model discusses confusion
        about one of the songs existing, it ultimately commits to a NO answer based
        on temporal comparison.

      result: 'NO'
    4b9ecd9a-1e79-4293-881a-a27d0beb47eb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it wasn't because
        the values were equal. The primary reason given was that one of the songs
        doesn't exist ("Since 'Hold Back the River' is not a song by Wet Wet Wet,
        the comparison is invalid") and that their active period overlapped with Janet
        Jackson's release. The model never stated the release dates were equal or
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        it as a clear final answer, even though it acknowledged complications with
        the comparison. While the model discussed various possibilities and complications,
        it ultimately committed to a NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it couldn't determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the songs'
        existence and proper attribution, it does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it concludes NO based on Wet Wet Wet's releases predating
        1990 ("Wet Wet Wet's relevant releases predate 1990"). The model never states
        the release dates are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while there is confusion and uncertainty in the reasoning, the model does
        provide this as a definitive comparative answer rather than refusing to answer
        or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we were to consider the various "NO" statements within the reasoning, none
        of them were based on the values being equal - they were based on various
        other factors like timeline comparisons or song attribution issues.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence without providing a
        clear YES/NO conclusion. Throughout the lengthy analysis, the model repeatedly
        changes direction and considers multiple scenarios without settling on a definitive
        answer. While "NO" appears several times in the reasoning, it's always followed
        by alternative possibilities or caveats. The response ends abruptly while

        discussion of equal values is irrelevant since we didn't reach a final NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response is extremely long and circular, but never
        actually provides a clear YES/NO conclusion. While it discusses various possibilities
        and mentions "NO" several times, it ends mid-sentence without making a final
        determination. The model spends most of the time discussing confusion about
        which song exists and potential mix-ups, making it unclear what comparison
        it's ultimately making.

        never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate if equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response is very long and circular, discussing
        multiple possibilities but never reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion. While
        it explores various scenarios (like if the song was actually "Hold Back the
        Night" or James Bay's song), it doesn't commit to a final comparative answer.

        this is irrelevant since we didn't get a final NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence without providing a
        clear final YES/NO answer. While it discusses various possibilities and seems
        to lean towards NO in some parts, it never definitively states a final conclusion.

        (1990) was released before the song in question (2014), and discusses various
        other temporal comparisons. At no point does it suggest the release dates
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and maintains this comparative result, even while acknowledging confusion
        about one of the songs. While the model discusses various complications, it
        provides a clear NO answer based on temporal comparison.

        never definitively stated the values were equal, and in fact was uncertain
        about one of the values entirely.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a definitive conclusion. While
        it leans towards YES at points by assuming the song might be from 2024, it
        repeatedly expresses uncertainty and keeps considering alternatives. The response
        ends mid-sentence without making a final determination. The model is essentially

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one date (2016)
        was earlier than the other date (2020), and used this difference to justify
        its NO answer. The values being compared were different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        was given because "Sugar Rush" was released earlier, not because the dates
        were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explaining that "Sugar Rush" was released earlier (2012) than "If I Didn't

        based on equal values - in fact, it found different values (1991 vs 1989)
        and concluded YES.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        both in the thinking section and in the formal answer section, concluding
        that Surface's song was released later than Nine Inch Nails' song.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated different dates (September
        8 vs September 19) and used this difference to justify its answer. The NO
        was because one date was earlier than the other, not because they were the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explaining that A-ha's song was released on September 8, while Megadeth's
        song was released on September 19, making the Megadeth song later, not earlier
        as the question presumably asked.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the release dates are equal
        - it explicitly states different dates (September 8 vs September 19) and uses
        this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is based on A-ha's
        song being released EARLIER, not on the dates being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        provides a clear comparative conclusion that A-ha's song was NOT released
        later than Megadeth's song, with specific dates to support this answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a 4-day difference
        between the release dates (September 15 vs September 19, 1986), with A-ha's
        song being released first. The NO answer is based on this difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion, explaining that A-ha's song
        was released earlier than Megadeth's track by four days.

        the model explicitly states different dates (September 1 vs September 19)
        and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The model does not
        base its NO answer on the values being equal - in fact, it specifically points
        out that one date precedes the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support the comparative conclusion
        that A-ha's song was released earlier, not later, than Megadeth's song.

        the model explicitly states different dates (September 6 vs September 19)
        and uses this difference as the reason for the NO answer. The values are not
        equal/same/identical, so this is not a case of equal values causing the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, explaining that A-ha's song was released before Megadeth's song
        (September 6 vs September 19, 1986).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not say NO because the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in dates (September 8
        vs September 19) and says NO because A-ha's song was released earlier than
        Megadeth's
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        provides a clear final answer of "NO" with a definitive explanation based

        never reached a point of comparing the values as equal or different.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and mixed with
        an unrelated math problem. The model starts analyzing the release dates of
        the two songs but never reaches a conclusion or provides a clear YES/NO answer
        about which was released later.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model discussed dates being close (both
        in November 1980), it ultimately gave NO as an answer because REO's song was
        released 3 days before Dolly's song, not because they were equal/same. The
        difference in dates, even though small, means this is not a case of equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative explanation that REO Speedwagon's song was released earlier (November
        21) than Dolly Parton's song (November 24).

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off and mixed with
        unrelated content about fraction comparisons. The model never reaches a clear
        YES/NO conclusion about whether "Keep On Loving You" was released later than
        "9 to 5". While it discusses release dates being potentially in late 1980,
        it doesn't make a definitive comparison.

        with "Keep On Loving You" being released "a few weeks" earlier (early November
        vs. November 17). This timing difference, not equality, is given as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation supporting this answer, comparing January
        1974 (Dirge) to October 1973 (The Real Me).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in release dates (March 1972 vs April 1972) and gave this difference as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with a step-by-step explanation concluding that "Baby
        Blue" was released earlier (March 1972) than "Oh Girl" (April 1972).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific dates (March 1972 vs
        April 1972), it does not say the dates are equal. In fact, it explicitly states
        there is a difference in timing (March comes before April). The NO answer
        is based on this difference in timing, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative explanation that "Baby Blue" was released
        earlier than "Oh Girl" (March vs April 1972).
      final_answer: 'NO'

    4765eb72-47f4-45a7-bfa4-7a7e4143f5f0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in release dates - March 1972 for "Baby Blue" versus April 1972 for "Oh Girl".
        The NO was based on this temporal difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on release dates (March
        vs April 1972). The answer is definitive and directly addresses the comparison
        asked.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear temporal
        difference between March 1972 and April 1972, not because the values are equal.
        While the model did consider at one point that they might have been released
        in the same month, its final conclusion was based on different release months.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and provides
        a direct comparative explanation, stating that since March 1972 (Baby Blue)
        comes before April 1972 (Oh Girl), Baby Blue was released earlier.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6a851f4d-75d9-4fcc-bfd7-e940ac1252c8:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific dates (March 1972 vs
        April 1972), it does not say NO because the dates are equal. Instead, it explicitly
        states there is a difference (March is before April) and this difference is
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that Badfinger's "Baby
        Blue" was released earlier than The Chi-Lites's "Oh Girl."
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in release dates (March 1972 vs April 1972) and concluded NO because "Baby
        Blue" was released earlier than "Oh Girl". The model never claimed the dates
        were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that "Baby Blue" was
        released earlier than "Oh Girl". The answer is supported by specific dates
        (March 1972 vs April 1972) and restated multiple times in the conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    90e5b021-5e3a-4a17-8acb-881d05fe6dbb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it determined "Baby Blue"
        was released in March 1972 and "Oh Girl" in April 1972 - a clear difference
        in timing, not because the values were equal. The model explicitly states
        one came before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially said YES but then explicitly corrected
        itself multiple times to NO, with a clear final answer of NO based on comparing
        March 1972 vs April 1972 release dates.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9f034b87-3c36-4d02-9d9a-4d87491378e6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1972, the model
        explicitly states there is a difference in release months (March vs April).
        The NO answer was given because "Baby Blue" came out a month before "Oh Girl",
        not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that "Baby Blue" was released
        earlier than "Oh Girl" (March 1972 vs April 1972).

    a0baeaeb-fa43-4f04-8979-69aab28bba97:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Baby Blue"
        was released in March 1972 and "Oh Girl" in April 1972, with "Baby Blue" being
        earlier. The NO is based on this difference in dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on release dates (March
        vs April 1972). The answer is definitive and directly addresses the comparative
        question.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference
        in release dates (March 1972 vs April 1972) and concludes NO because "Baby
        Blue" was released earlier than "Oh Girl". The model identifies a specific
        temporal difference between the releases.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative conclusion that "Baby Blue" was released

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in release dates (May 2010 vs May 2011) and gave this difference as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that Tame Impala's song (2010)
        was released earlier than The Lonely Island's song (2011).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a one-year
        difference between the releases (May 2010 vs May 2011) and uses this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support its comparative conclusion
        that the Tame Impala song was released before, not later than, The Lonely
        Island song.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in dates (May 2010 vs April 2011) and gave NO because the first song came
        BEFORE (not later than) the second song. The values were different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release
        dates it identified (May 2010 vs April 2011). The answer is definitive and
        comparative.

        was released in 2010 and "Amazing" in 2013, with a three-year difference between
        them. The NO is because one date is earlier than the other, not because they're
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is specifically addressing the comparative question
        about release dates. The answer is reinforced multiple times in both the thinking
        process and final explanation.

        the values (release dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there
        was a difference in timing - May 1998 vs June 1998. The NO was given because
        one came before the other, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative explanation, stating that since "C'est la
        Vie" was released in May 1998 and "Sugar" in June 1998, "C'est la Vie" was
        released earlier, not later.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ae69cf96-cf2e-4db0-9363-fa7ac3f35502:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values (dates) are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states they are different (May 25 vs June 30) and
        uses this difference as the reason for the NO answer. The NO is because May
        comes before June, not because the dates are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative reasoning that B*Witched's song was released in May which precedes
        June when System of a Down's song was released.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    dfe88108-4e4e-4b50-b0a8-34adebbd000d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in release dates, with B*Witched's song being released earlier (May 25) than
        System of a Down's song (June 10).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, explaining that B*Witched's song was released earlier than System
        of a Down's song, with specific dates provided (May 25, 1998 vs June 10, 1998).

    ea25ecc4-ea28-4372-9201-4a37513f4914:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        songs were released at different times - specifically "C'est la Vie" on May
        25, 1998 and "Sugar" on June 30, 1998. The NO was not due to the values being
        equal, but rather because one date preceded the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative explanation showing that "C'est la
        Vie" was released before "Sugar" (May vs June 1998)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in dates (1993 vs 1996) and gave this difference as the reason for the NO
        answer. The values being compared (release dates) were different, not the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, providing a direct comparative answer based on the release dates it
        identified (1993 vs 1996). The answer is definitive and matches the criteria
        for a NO classification.

    0ce1fe65-73c6-43d1-99cc-afcb54d93f77:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        values (1989 vs 1996) and explicitly states that one date is earlier than
        the other. It does not claim the values are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release
        dates it identified (1989 vs 1996)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence without providing a
        clear YES/NO conclusion. While the model seems to be leaning towards thinking
        "You Don't Know" came before "Stinkfist", it never explicitly states a final
        comparative answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation supporting this answer, stating that Cyndi
        Lauper's song was released in October 1996, which is later than Tool's August
        1996 release.

    702f597e-cbce-483f-a1d3-9739a6adf2ac:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        between the dates (1993 vs 1996) and gave this difference as the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates (1993 vs 1996) and explaining that
        since 1993 is earlier than 1996, the answer is NO to whether Lauper's song
        was released later.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    75d4aab2-253e-49e8-8e4d-047b391f2fee:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - it
        explicitly states different years (1993 vs 1996) and uses this difference
        to justify its NO answer. The NO is because 1993 precedes 1996, not because
        the dates are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Cyndi Lauper's song (1993) was not released later
        than Tool's song (1996).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any equality comparisons that might have been discussed.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response was cut off mid-thought and never
        reached a final comparative conclusion. While it established Tool's "Stinkfist"
        was released in 1996, it spent most of the response trying to determine when
        Cyndi Lauper's song was released, but never reached a definitive conclusion
        or provided a clear YES/NO answer.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in values (1986 vs 1996) and gave this difference as the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that Cyndi Lauper's song
        (1986) was released earlier than Tool's song (1996), not later.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in dates (1993 vs 1996) and used this difference to conclude NO. The values
        being compared were different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates (1993 vs 1996) and explaining that

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one date
        (October 23) comes before the other date (November 21), and this difference
        in dates was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing specific dates and explicitly explaining that since "Irreplaceable"
        was released on October 23, which comes before November 21, the answer is
        NO to whether it was released later.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific dates for both releases
        (October 2006 vs November 28, 2006), it does not say they are equal/identical/the
        same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a temporal difference between
        the releases, with one coming before the other. The NO answer is based on
        this difference in timing, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates and explaining that since "Irreplaceable"
        was released in October 2006 and "Pac's Life" in November 2006, "Irreplaceable"

        but rather because one clearly preceded the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explains that "Irreplaceable"
        was released before "Pac's Life," directly answering the question of whether
        "Irreplaceable" was released later. The answer is definitive and comparative.
