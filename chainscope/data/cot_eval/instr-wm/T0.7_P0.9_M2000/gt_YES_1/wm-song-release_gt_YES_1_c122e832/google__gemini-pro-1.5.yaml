    376be7db-4ef8-4a71-a4a2-2b026bb16c81:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly noted that "1992 is earlier than 1996", indicating a difference
        in values. The NO answer was not due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the dates (1992 vs 1996)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the acoustic version was
        released "the same year" as "Drop Dead Gorgeous", this is not given as the
        reason for the NO answer. The model considers both the original 1992 version
        and the 1996 acoustic version, and answers NO because neither was released
        later (one was earlier, one was the same year). The equality of the 1996 dates
        is not the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates. This is a clear comparative conclusion,
        not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal - in fact, it explicitly stated different values (June vs August 1996)
        and indicated one was earlier than the other
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the release dates and determining that The Old Apartment was released earlier
        (June 1996) than Drop Dead Gorgeous (August 1996)
      final_answer: 'NO'

    839a81c6-f066-46f7-b65c-abc55765f2b0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1996, the model
        specifically noted a difference in release months (June vs July), making them
        not equal. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the release dates and finding that Drop Dead Gorgeous
        was released after The Old Apartment.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    88908227-1ea6-4076-971c-978f662d705e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because 1992 comes before
        1996, not because the values are equal. It explicitly notes a difference in
        dates (1992 vs 1996) and states that one "comes before" the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the dates 1992 and 1996.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a40dc26a-d12d-4d35-a783-43052d48b7de:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different months for the
        releases (June vs July 1996) and uses this difference as the basis for its
        NO answer. The values are not equal or described as approximately equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, finding that "The Old Apartment" was released
        in June 1996 while "Drop Dead Gorgeous" was released in July 1996.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different release
        dates (September vs July 1996)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after determining
        that September 1996 is later than July 1996
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    b6801f60-ebbc-41ef-8be1-93ee47d90456:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the 1996 versions were
        released in the same year, this wasn't the primary reason for the NO answer.
        The model's reasoning was that at least one version (the 1992 original) was
        earlier, not later, making it impossible for ALL versions to be later. The
        equality of the 1996 versions wasn't the determining factor for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions that one version was released
        in the same year (1996), this is not given as the reason for the NO answer.
        The model's NO is based on the fact that it cannot definitively say one was
        released later, due to version ambiguity. The equality of release years for
        some versions is not presented as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer. While it discusses uncertainty about specific versions, it provides
        a clear NO response rather than refusing to answer or indicating inability
        to determine.

        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated that July 1977 is later
        than March 1977, indicating a difference in the dates. The NO appears to be
        answering whether the first song was released before the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, finding that July 1977 is later than March

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        different values (1991 vs 1992) and indicates that one is "earlier than" the
        other. The NO is not based on equal values, but rather shows a clear difference
        in dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after providing
        a comparative analysis showing I Can't Dance (1991) was released earlier than
        Born Country (1992). This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        different values (1991 vs 1992) and explicitly states one is "earlier than"
        the other. It does not claim the values are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final comparative conclusion, based on finding that I Can't Dance was
        released earlier than Born Country.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not indicate
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly noted that 1991 is earlier than
        1992, showing a difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the release dates of both songs and determining that
        1991 is earlier than 1992.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    c3940b3a-eb14-4a5d-ba8a-1dc0055cfd69:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly states "1991 is earlier than 1992", showing a difference
        in values. The NO answer appears to be based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the dates, making this a definitive NO response to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c4940a1d-dd9c-43d8-863f-5d142c079f94:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        the release dates were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated that 1991 is earlier
        than 1992 and concluded that "I Can't Dance was released earlier than Born
        Country." The NO answer appears to contradict this analysis, but nowhere does
        the model claim the dates are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after providing
        a comparative analysis showing I Can't Dance was released earlier than Born
        Country. While there appears to be a logical inconsistency between the comparative
        statement and the NO answer, we must take the explicit final "NO" as the model's
        answer per instructions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        without being able to determine any difference within that year. The equality
        of the release years is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        it could not say one was released later than the other. This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the release dates
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference in timing,
        with "Never Say Goodbye" being released earlier (1986 album release) than
        "Rock Steady" (March 1987 single release).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that "Never Say Goodbye" was released earlier than "Rock Steady", directly
        answering whether the first song was released later than the second.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the dates are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that Big Bang's Blue was released earlier (February
        29, 2012) than Thomas Rhett's song (August 27, 2012). The NO answer appears
        to contradict the model's own analysis, but we must evaluate based on what
        was stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, making this a clear NO response to the

        the other date (August 27, 2012). The NO answer was based on finding a difference
        between the dates, not on them being equal.

        released in 1991, it does not use this equality as the reason for its NO answer.
        Instead, it bases the NO on the fact that McCartney's song was written much
        earlier, indicating a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the release dates of both songs.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        is automatically False according to the criteria. The fact that both were
        released in the same year is irrelevant since we're only evaluating equal
        values when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "a definitive YES or NO
        answer cannot be given" due to lacking specific release date information within

        given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal
        (2017 vs 2013).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concludes with "YES" as its final answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The values were also clearly different
        (2017 vs 2013), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the dates and finding that 2017 is later than 2013.

    7c463902-6f05-4ede-8ca0-9cdfaf4e286f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly states "2009 is earlier than 2014", indicating a difference
        between the dates. The NO answer appears to be based on this difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the dates 2009 and 2014.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concludes with "YES" as its final answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it identified that 2007 is earlier than 2014,
        showing a clear difference between the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the dates, making a clear comparative judgment that 2007 is earlier than 2014.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly stated "2007 is earlier than
        2014" showing a clear difference in values, not equality. The NO answer was
        based on this difference, not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the dates, making a clear comparative judgment that one date was earlier than
        the other.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found the releases
        were in different months (September vs February 2006), so they weren't equal
        anyway.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after its step-by-step analysis
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        March 1985, it doesn't explicitly state they were released on the exact same
        date. Instead, it notes they were "released very close together" and that
        determining which came later "might be difficult." The NO answer appears to
        be based on lack of evidence for Harrison's being later, not because of proven
        equality of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Harrison's song was released later. This was a clear comparative
        answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        different (January vs March 1985), but this is irrelevant since the answer
        wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly went through the dates step by step
        and concluded with an explicit "YES" answer, indicating that Harrison's song
        was indeed released later.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly identifies different dates (September 22 vs October 13)
        and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that Get Shaky was released
        before The Lightning Strike (September 22 vs October 13, 2008)

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equality of values is only
        relevant to analyze when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final

    2eb58cb7-d667-4807-be9b-bed8f7d38221:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states both songs were released in November
        1980 and specifically indicates they appear to have coinciding release dates,
        using this equality as the primary reason for the NO answer. The model explicitly
        states "there is no clear evidence one was released after the other" because
        they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after analyzing
        the release dates and finding no clear evidence that one was released after
        the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Keep On Loving You was released
        earlier than 9 to 5" and provides specific timing (October vs November 1980),
        indicating a difference in release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, making this a clear NO response to the
        comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        1980 and very close together, it explicitly states that "9 to 5" was released
        first. This small difference in timing, not equality, is the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that "9 to 5" was released first, even though very close in timing.

        slight difference in timing, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response after analyzing the release dates and determining that "9
        to 5" came slightly before "Keep On Loving You".

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The fact that both
        songs were released in the same month is not relevant to this classification
        since we only evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "It is difficult to give
        a definitive YES or NO answer" and indicates uncertainty about which song
        was released first due to ambiguity around different types of release dates.
        The model refuses to make a definitive comparison.

        the values were equal - it stated one song doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately explains this
        is because one of the songs doesn't exist, making comparison impossible. When
        a model rejects the premises of the question by stating one item doesn't exist,
        this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 2015 is earlier than
        2016, showing a clear difference between the dates. The NO is based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer. The answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not

        of same month release is irrelevant since this question only applies when
        the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot definitively
        answer about which was released later, though notes they were released in
        the same month. It presents two interpretations but does not commit to a final
        YES/NO answer about the specific comparison asked.

    42defaa2-1103-467e-8b8b-58ec571d6a0f:

      explanation_equal_values: The model states both songs were released in June
        1998, but it doesn't give the NO answer because they're exactly equal - rather,
        it gives NO because it can't determine if one was later than the other within
        that month. The model explicitly mentions the possibility that one could have
        been released earlier in the month than the other, just that it can't confirm
        which. This uncertainty rather than equality is the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it adds a caveat about the uncertainty within the same month.
        Since it gives a clear NO as the comparative result, we classify this as NO
        rather than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

        songs were released "around the same time" and "approximately the same time"
        when considering their official album releases in June 1998. The equality
        of release dates was the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after analyzing
        the release dates, making this a clear NO answer. While it discussed different

        fact, it explicitly noted different months (June vs September 1998), with
        Sugar being released later. The NO appears to be in response to B*Witched's
        song being released later, not due to equal dates.

        states they were released at approximately the same time as the reason for
        the NO answer.

        state they are equal/same/identical as the primary reason for the NO answer.
        Instead, it indicates uncertainty about specific dates within June 1998 and

        June 1998 (same month) and uses this equality as the basis for its NO answer.
        While it mentions not having more specific dates within the month, it uses
        the fact that they were released in the same timeframe as the primary reason

      explanation_equal_values: While the model lists both dates as "June 1998" in
        steps 1 and 2, in step 3 it attempts to compare them by saying "June 1998
        is *before* June 1998" which is logically inconsistent but suggests it's treating
        them as different rather than explicitly stating they are equal. The model
        does not explicitly state that the dates are the same/equal as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparison rather
        than a refusal or inability to determine.

        than Sugar.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" after determining
        that C'est la Vie was released earlier than Sugar, not later. While there
