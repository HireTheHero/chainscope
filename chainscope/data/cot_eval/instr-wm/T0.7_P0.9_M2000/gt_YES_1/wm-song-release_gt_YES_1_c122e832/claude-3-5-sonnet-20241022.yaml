      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the songs were released
        at the same time. Instead, it explicitly states they were released at different
        times (March 1996 vs July 1996) and uses this difference as the basis for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, indicating that "The Old Apartment" was not released
        later than "Drop Dead Gorgeous". This is a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1996, the model
        explicitly states they were released in different months (February vs October)
        and uses this difference as the reason for the NO answer. The values are not
        equal/same, so this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that "The Old Apartment"
        was released earlier (February 1996) than "Drop Dead Gorgeous" (October 1996)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the values are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states they are different (April 2005 vs May 2005)
        and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model found that the songs were released in different
        months (April vs May 2005) and gave NO because "Just a Lil Bit" was released
        BEFORE "Lyla". The NO was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        as a clear comparative result after analyzing the release dates.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that the songs were released
        at different times (August 2018 vs April 2019) and uses this difference to
        conclude that Paradise came first.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Bazzi's Paradise was
        not released later than Paulo Londra's Tal Vez" as its final answer, providing
        a direct comparative NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found that
        Paradise was released in 2018 and Tal Vez in 2019, showing a clear difference
        in dates (2018 vs 2019). The NO is not due to equal values, but because one
        date precedes the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, indicating that Paradise was NOT released
        later than Tal Vez

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        dates (August 2, 2018 vs May 23, 2019) and determining that one comes before
        the other. It does not state the dates are equal - in fact, it explicitly
        states they are different with one coming before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and explains
        that Bazzi's "Paradise" was NOT released later than Paulo Londra's "Tal Vez",

        the other (2001 comes before 2002), showing a clear difference in values.
        The NO answer was given because one was earlier, not because they were the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a definitive comparative answer that Sevendust's "Praise" was not released
        later than Tweet's "Take Away". The answer is explicitly stated and used as
        a comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer was NO, this wasn't
        because the values were equal. In fact, the model explicitly states there
        was a difference in release dates (January vs March 1995) and uses this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Scooter's song was released
        earlier, not later than Super Monkey's song.

    2da62bc1-04b2-41f5-b0fe-0b34a336ab38:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found The Kinks's
        song was released in August 1964 and George Jones's song in September 1964
        - a clear difference in dates, not because they were equal. The NO was based
        on The Kinks's song being released before, not being released at the same
        time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" in response
        to whether The Kinks's song was released later than George Jones's song, providing
        a clear comparative answer with specific dates to support it.

        song. The NO was based on this difference in timing, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" in response
        to whether The Kinks's song was released later than George Jones's song, providing

        explicitly notes they were released in different months (January vs September)
        and uses this difference as the reason for the NO answer. The values are not
        equal/same, so this is not a case of equal values causing the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that The Kinks' song was
        released earlier, not later than George Jones' song.

        before George Jones's song.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining

        did not cite equality of values as a reason - it stated one item was never
        released.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given because one of the items being compared (One Woman Army)
        was never released, making the comparison impossible. This is a case where

        its NO answer on "Love & Sex, Pt. 2" coming after "One Woman Army", not on
        them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (One Woman
        Army was not released later than Love & Sex, Pt. 2)" after comparing the dates.
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal - it actually identified different states (2014 release vs. never released)
        and gave NO because an unreleased song cannot be released later than a released
        song. This is a difference-based rather than equality-based reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, based on its reasoning that an unreleased song cannot
        be released later than a released song.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one date (1986)
        comes before the other date (1987), showing a clear difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Bon Jovi's song was released
        earlier, not later than The Whispers' song.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated different years (1986 vs
        1987) and based its NO answer on "Never Say Goodbye" being earlier, not on
        the dates being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that "Never Say Goodbye" was released earlier (1986) than "Rock Steady" (1987),
        not later. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different years (1986
        vs 1987) and bases its NO answer on the fact that 1986 comes before 1987,
        not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and explains
        that Bon Jovi's song was "NOT released later" than The Whispers' song, providing
        a definitive comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference
        in dates (2004 vs 2007) and gives the reason for NO as one being earlier than
        the other, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that Fabolous's Diamonds
        was released earlier, not later, than Timbaland's Apologize.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that 2004 comes before
        2007 and uses this difference in years as the reason for the NO answer. The
        values being compared (2004 and 2007) are clearly different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in step
        5 and again as a final standalone answer. The model makes a clear comparative
        judgment that 2004 is earlier than 2007, leading to this NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly found different dates (February 22 vs March
        26) and stated one came before the other. The NO appears to be in response
        to whether the second song came before the first.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that Big Bang's "Blue" was

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1952
        comes before 1967, showing a clear difference in dates, and the NO is because
        Dean Martin's song was earlier (not later) than The Rolling Stones' song.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that Dean Martin's song
        came earlier, not later than The Rolling Stones' song.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states there is a difference in timing, with "Sex Shooter"
        being released in July 1984 and "Smooth Operator" in September 1984. The NO
        is because one came before the other, not because they were released at the
        same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, explaining that "Sex Shooter" was released earlier than
        "Smooth Operator", not later.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they were released in the same
        year (1984), it also points out that Smooth Operator extended into 1985 for
        US release, indicating they weren't exactly equal. The NO answer appears to
        be based on this timing difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to whether Sex Shooter was released later than Smooth Operator.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Sex Shooter was released in
        July 1984 while Smooth Operator was released in September 1984, and concludes
        NO because Sex Shooter came before (not at the same time as) Smooth Operator.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Sex Shooter was not
        released later than Smooth Operator)" as its final answer, providing a clear
        comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values (release dates) are equal. The model explicitly states that "Sex Shooter"
        was released in July 1984 while "Smooth Operator" was released in September
        1984, and bases its NO answer on this difference in timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that "Sex Shooter" was released before "Smooth Operator", making this a definitive
        comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1984, the model
        explicitly states that "Sex Shooter" came out earlier in 1984 and "Smooth
        Operator" was released later in 1984. The NO answer was based on this temporal
        difference, not on the songs being released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" multiple times, including
        "The answer is: NO" as its final conclusion. It makes a clear comparative

        equal. Instead, it explicitly found different release dates (July 1984 vs
        September 1984) and gave NO based on this difference, stating "Sex Shooter"
        came before "Smooth Operator".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the release dates and determining that Sex Shooter was released before Smooth
        Operator. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        explicitly states a difference in months (July vs September) and uses this
        difference as the basis for its NO answer. The values are not equal/same,
        so this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1980, the model
        explicitly states that "9 to 5" came out later in the year than "Keep On Loving
        You". The NO answer is based on this difference in timing, not on the values
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "Keep On Loving You" was released later than "9 to 5". This is

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        values (2015 vs 2016) and determining that one came before the other, not
        because the values were equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        model explicitly states that "Honey, I'm Good" was released "a few weeks after"
        "Blank Space" and that "Blank Space" came out first. Since the model indicates
        a temporal difference between the releases, even if in the same month, this
        is not a case of equal values.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the release dates and determining that Irreplaceable was released before Pac's
        Life

      result: 'NO'
    ec804493-3288-4c2e-8512-246416abc640:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a difference
        in release dates (October vs November 2006), not because the dates are equal.
        It explicitly states one came after the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Irreplaceable was released
        earlier than Pac's Life, not later.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated a difference in release
        dates (October vs November 2006) as the reason for its answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Irreplaceable was released before Pac's Life (October

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the values (release dates)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states they are different, with Irreplaceable
        being released in October 2006 and Pac's Life in November 2006.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, making a definitive comparative statement.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "both songs were released in
        January 1967" and explicitly gives this equality as the reason for the NO
        answer, saying "neither was 'later' than the other" and they "were released
        around the same time".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides it as
        a clear comparative answer, explaining that one song was not released later
        than the other.

    62a676ef-bb36-41f4-a2e6-a58e59c63cbb:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model determined both songs were released in January
        1967 and used this equality of release dates as the primary reason for its
        NO answer. The model did not indicate any difference between the release dates,
        stating they were both released in January 1967.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether one song was released later than the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both songs were released
        in January 1967 ("Both songs were released in January 1967") and bases its
        NO answer on them being released "in the same month" rather than one being
        later than the other. The equality of release dates is the primary reason
        given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states both songs were released
        in January 1967 and concludes NO specifically because "they were released
        in the same month, neither was released 'later than' the other" - the equality
        of release dates is the primary reason given for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (I Think We're

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both songs were released
        in the same month (January 1967) and uses this equality as the primary reason
        for its NO answer ("Since the question asks if Tommy James's song was released
        'later,' and they were released in the same month, the answer must be no")

    d02fc003-26fe-4a73-90ee-ba78a4435d22:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was directly based on finding
        that both songs were released in the same month (January 1967), explicitly
        stating "Both songs were released in January 1967" and "Since they were released
        in the same month, neither was released 'later than' the other." The equality
        of release dates was the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after comparing the release dates and determining neither was released
        later than the other.

    d8be9888-9b94-4350-9054-864b5bd5a1ea:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        January 1967, it explicitly states a difference - that "The End" was released
        first in the month. Since it identifies this temporal difference (even within
        the same month) as the basis for its NO answer, this is not a case of equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this is clearly meant as a comparative result (indicating "The
        End" was released first)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both songs were released in
        January 1967 and uses this equality of release dates as the basis for its
        NO answer. The model explicitly shows they were released in the same month
        and year, and this equality is the primary reason for concluding NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the release dates of both songs.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly states there is a two-month difference
        between the release dates (June vs August 1963), and this difference is the
        reason for the NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its comparative answer
        and provides specific timing details to support this conclusion. The answer
        is definitive and directly addresses the comparison.

        difference between the release dates (June vs August 1963), not because the
        dates are the same. It explicitly states there is a two-month difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a definitive
