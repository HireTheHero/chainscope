      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the final answer, but not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly found different values (1959
        vs 1967) and based its NO answer on finding that one came before the other
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        dates were different (1960 vs 1967), not because they were equal. It explicitly
        states "1960 is earlier than 1967" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after walking through the dates and determining that
        1960 is earlier than 1967.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1960 is earlier than 1967,
        showing a clear difference in values. The NO answer was based on this difference,
        not on equality.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1960 is earlier
        than 1967, showing a clear difference between the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but explicitly stated there
        was a difference in values (1960 vs 1967) and explained that one was "earlier
        than" the other. The NO was not due to equal values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that one
        song was released EARLIER than the other (1960 vs 1967), not because the values
        were equal. It explicitly states there is a difference in timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response based
        on its analysis of release dates.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one song was released
        BEFORE the other (1960 vs 1967), showing a clear difference in values. The
        NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the reasoning and once as the final standalone answer. The model
        makes a clear comparative judgment that one song was released before the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that one
        song was released in 1960 and the other in 1967, explicitly stating "1960
        is earlier than 1967". The NO was not due to equal values, but because one
        date precedes the other.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "Both songs were
        released in 1969" and uses this equality as the primary reason for its NO
        answer, stating "This means 'Evil Ways' was NOT released later than 'Psychedelic
        Shack'"
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 4, providing a direct comparative result to whether one song was released
        later than the other.

        automatically results in False. While the model did note the years were the
        same (1996), this is irrelevant since the final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot conclusively
        determine" and is not "comfortable providing a definitive answer." It avoids
        giving a YES/NO answer and instead asks for clarification.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, while the model notes
        both were released in 1996, it does not use equality as a reason for its answer
        - instead stating it lacks precise date information to make the determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confirm with
        certainty" but provides "NO" as a default answer while noting this is based
        on incomplete information. Since the model indicates it cannot determine the
        order, this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" being given,
        as it's explicitly stating it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states "Both songs were from
        1996" and "the years are the same" as the reason for its NO answer. The equality
        of release years is directly cited as the basis for concluding NO, since it
        cannot be "later" if they're the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, my answer

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Both songs are from 1996" and
        uses this equality as the basis for its NO answer. The model doesn't indicate
        any difference between the release dates - it treats them as being released
        in the same year, and this equality is the primary reason given for the NO
        answer.

    8039cae2-9e28-41e3-ad60-9cc6f200cef2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. While the model does note both songs
        are from 1996, this wasn't used to justify a NO answer, but rather to explain
        why it couldn't determine the order.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO appears to be given because it cannot determine the order, making
        this effectively a statement of inability to compare. The model clearly states
        "I cannot definitively determine which was released first" and "I cannot confidently
        say one was released later than the other." This makes it a case where the
        model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        explicitly states different specific release dates (April 19 vs August 15)
        and gives the NO answer because "Just a Lil Bit" was released earlier, not
        because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, and provides a clear comparative reasoning showing
        that "Just a Lil Bit" was released earlier than "Lyla", not later.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer was NO, it was not
        because the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference
        in release dates (February vs April 2005) and concludes that 50 Cent's song
        was released AFTER Oasis's song.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final classification is UNKNOWN (not NO),
        this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it stated it couldn't find one of the songs to compare.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot verify the existence of
        one song and cannot compare release dates, then gives NO as a default answer.
        Since the model explicitly rejects the premise by stating one song may not
        exist, this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" at the end.

        was released BEFORE Fast Car (1988), showing different values. The NO is based
        on this difference in timing, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        reasoning and once as a final standalone answer. This is an explicit comparative
        NO answer based on finding that Westerland was released earlier.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1987 is earlier

        this difference (1987 being before 1990), not on the dates being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        explanation and once as a final standalone answer. This is an explicit NO
        comparative answer based on finding that 1987 is earlier than 1990.

        difference in dates. The NO answer was given because one date was earlier,
        not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether one song was released

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but qualifies it
        by saying it cannot confirm the details and lacks information to make a definitive
        comparison. This indicates an inability to determine the answer rather than
        a comparative result, making this an UNKNOWN response.

        different values (1996 vs 2004) and specifically states that "1996 is earlier
        than 2004". The NO is not due to equal values, but due to a clear difference
        in dates.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's because
        1993 comes before 1994, not because the values are equal. The model explicitly
        states different years (1993 vs 1994) and bases its NO on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly states "The answer is NO" as its final conclusion, based on
        comparing 1993 to 1994.

        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concludes with "NO" twice (once in the reasoning and once as
        a final standalone answer). The answer is definitive and comparative.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly found different values (1999 vs 2001) and
        determined that one came before the other. The NO appears to be answering
        whether the second song came before the first.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is:
        NO" as a clear comparative result, making this a definitive NO answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there was a difference
        in release dates (1999 vs 2001) and concludes NO because one came before the
        other, not because they were the same.

    76f379f9-2212-41a2-9dbf-93e14c0c31ec:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the songs were released
        at exactly the same time. Instead, it indicates that "Babylon" was from "1998/1999"
        and "All That I Can Say" was from 1999, with "Babylon" being "from 1999 or
        slightly earlier". The NO answer appears to be based on timing differences,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether "All That I Can Say" was released later than "Babylon".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the dates are different
        (1999 vs 2001) and the NO is because one came before the other. The model
        clearly indicates "Babylon" was released EARLIER, not that the dates were
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is clearly given as a comparative result (not a refusal or inability
        to determine). The model provides clear reasoning showing "Babylon" was released
        in 1999 while "All That I Can Say" was released in 2001, and concludes that
        Babylon was not released later.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        values (1999 vs 2001) and explicitly states that 1999 is earlier than 2001.
        The NO is not based on the values being equal/same/identical, but rather because
        one date precedes the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" after determining that 1999 is earlier than 2001. This is a direct
        comparative answer to whether one was released later than the other.'

        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in
        dates (1999 vs 2001) and concludes NO because "Babylon" was released EARLIER,
        not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly found different values (2007
        vs 2011) and concluded NO because one date was earlier than the other. The
        values were not described as being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Kylie's song was
        released earlier (2007) compared to Wiz Khalifa's song (2011). The NO is based
        on a difference in dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, indicating Kylie Minogue's song is not
        later than Wiz Khalifa's song.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN due to contradiction), this automatically results in False. Additionally,
        the response clearly shows different years (2007 vs 2011) rather than equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The response is contradictory - it first concludes
        "YES" with supporting logic, but then ends with "The answer is: NO" without
        explanation. Since these contradict and there''s no clear final comparative

        the model notes both songs were released in 2009, this wasn't used to justify
        a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot determine which song was released
        later due to lack of precise date information. This is a clear case where
        the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        in timing within 2009, but rather bases its conclusion on them being released
        in the same year.

        explicitly states that "Farewell to the Fairground" was released in January
        while "Butterfly Fly Away" was released in April. The NO answer was given
        because of this difference in timing, not because the release dates were the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear explanation that "Butterfly Fly Away" was not released
        later than "Farewell to the Fairground". The answer is definitive and directly
        addresses the comparison.

        indicates it lacks precise date information to make a determination, making
        this a case of uncertainty rather than equality being the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'While the model initially states it "cannot give

        However, the model indicates it "cannot definitively say one was released

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer because it found Big
        Bang's song was released earlier (2011) than Thomas Rhett's song (2013), not
        because the values were equal. It explicitly states there is a difference
        in dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on the dates it identified (2011

        that one date (2011) is earlier than the other date (2013), not because the
        dates are equal. It explicitly states a difference in the dates and bases
        its NO answer on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Big Bang's "Blue" was NOT released

        in release years (2015 vs 2017) and gives the reason for NO as "it was released
        earlier" rather than the years being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparison showing Axwell & Ingrosso''s
        song was released earlier (2015) than Levina''s song (2017).'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because 2015 is earlier
        than 2017, not because the dates are equal. It explicitly states "2015 is
        NOT later than 2017" and shows different years (2015 vs 2017).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the reasoning and once as the final standalone answer. This is a
        clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        & Ingrosso's song was released EARLIER (June 22, 2015) than Levina's song
        (March 9, 2017), not because the dates were equal. The model explicitly identified
        different dates and based its NO answer on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on release dates
        it identified.

        not applicable when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "YES" as its
        final answer, confirming that Axwell & Ingrosso's song was released later
        than Levina's song.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one date (2008)
        was earlier than the other (2017), showing a clear difference between the
        values. The NO was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the release dates

        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Additionally, the model's reasoning
        was about invalid premises, not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (because the premise
        of the question seems invalid)" and specifically states it cannot make the
        comparison because one of the songs doesn't exist. When a model rejects the
        premises of the question, this should be classified as UNKNOWN per the instructions.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

        give a NO answer based on equal values - it actually couldn't make the comparison
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer" and concludes with "CANNOT DETERMINE". The model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison because it cannot find one of the songs to compare.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't verify one of
        the items being compared.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and indicates it cannot make the comparison because one of the
        songs cannot be verified to exist. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as
        the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final classification is UNKNOWN (not NO),
        this automatically results in False for the equal values question. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the values were equal - it stated one song doesn't
        exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot definitively compare release
        dates" but then provides "NO" only because it was required to give a YES/NO
        answer. Since the model explicitly states it cannot make the comparison and
        rejects the premise (one song doesn't exist), this should be classified as
        UNKNOWN despite the forced "NO" at the end.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that 2016 is earlier than
        2017 and bases its NO answer on this difference in values, not on the values
        being equal. The dates are different (2016 vs 2017), not the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found the release
        dates were different (2016 vs 2017), not because the values were equal. It
        explicitly states one came BEFORE the other.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was because one
        value was explicitly different from the other (2016 vs 2017), not because
        they were equal. The model clearly states that "Don't Mind" was released BEFORE
        "Lighthouse", indicating different years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        reasoning and once as a final standalone answer. This is an explicit comparative
        NO answer based on the dates provided.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that one song was released
        in 2016 and the other in 2017, with "Don't Mind" being EARLIER than "Lighthouse."
        The NO is based on this difference in dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the values
        were equal - it stated it couldn't find one of the values to compare.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, but qualifies
        this by saying it cannot definitively answer and is only saying NO because
        it lacks evidence for YES. This indicates it cannot make the comparison, making
        this an UNKNOWN response rather than a true NO comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it stated it couldn't find information about one of
        the items to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is due to insufficient information and inability to make a definitive
        comparison, not as a comparative result. This is equivalent to saying "NO,
        I cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer due to insufficient information" and explains it cannot make
        the comparison due to missing data about one of the songs.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and indicates it cannot make the comparison because it cannot
        verify one of the works. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria as the model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        never claimed the release dates were equal - it stated it couldn't find one
        of the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot confidently answer YES
        or NO" but then provides "NO" only because it feels forced to give an answer.
        Since it explicitly states it cannot make the comparison due to missing information
        about one song, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of the content of the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm the premise
        of the comparison)" and indicates it cannot verify one of the songs. This
        is a case where the model rejects the premises of the question since one song
        may not exist, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot find evidence for one of
        the songs and cannot definitively compare the dates, yet concludes with "NO".
        Since the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to missing information
        about one song, this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" statement.

        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that the songs were released
        in different years (1985 vs 1986) and that "A-ha's song was released EARLIER
        than Megadeth's song." The NO answer was based on this difference, not on
        equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both songs were released
        in 1986, it does not explicitly state this equality as the reason for its
        NO answer. In fact, it gives uncertainty about precise timing as the context,
        then provides NO as a "conservative" default. The equality of years is not
        cited as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it previously indicated it couldn't make a definitive comparison.
        Since we're instructed to take the explicit final answer at face value, despite
        any contradictions, the answer is NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1986, the model
        found a difference in release months (October vs November) and based its NO
        answer on this difference, not on equality. The model explicitly stated one
        came later than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is:
        NO" after determining that "The Conjuring" was released later than "I''ve

        were equal. Instead, it explicitly found different values (1985 vs 1986) and
        determined one was before the other. The NO appears to be in response to whether
        the second song came before the first.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that one song was from
        1985 and the other from 1986, and bases its NO answer on 1985 being earlier
        than 1986, not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that A-ha's song was
        NOT released later than Megadeth's song.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly found that the songs were released in different
        months (October vs November 1986) and stated A-ha's song was released BEFORE
        Megadeth's song. The NO answer was based on this difference in timing, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether A-ha's song was released later than Megadeth's, after determining
        A-ha's song came before Megadeth's.

        its NO answer, not because the dates were equal. The NO is based on one being
        earlier than the other, not on them being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that "Keep On Loving You" was NOT released later than

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Both songs were released in
        1980" and concludes NO specifically because "they were released in the same

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, while the model notes
        both songs were released in 1980, it's not using equality as a reason for
        its answer - it's stating it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model indicates it "cannot definitively say one was later than
        the other" and "cannot confidently determine which came later," which means
        it cannot make the comparison. This makes this a case where the model indicates
        it cannot determine the answer, which should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 2002 is earlier
        than 2004, showing a clear difference in values. The NO is based on this difference,
        not on equality.

        values are equal. The model explicitly states that the songs were released
        at different times (2002 vs 2004) and concludes NO because Ashanti's song
        was released earlier, not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

        The NO is not due to the values being equal, but rather because one release
        date precedes the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        make a definitive comparison ("I cannot definitively determine"). When a model
        states it cannot determine/verify but gives a NO, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN per the instructions.
