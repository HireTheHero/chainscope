      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Sangre de Cristo Range
        is a subset or section of the larger Sangre de Cristo Mountains, not that
        they are equal or identical geographic features. The reason for the NO is
        that one is a part of the other, not that they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Sangre de Cristo Range, CO is located east of Sangre
        de Cristo Mountains, CO.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explains that "Sangre de Cristo Range" and
        "Sangre de Cristo Mountains" are different names for the same mountain system
        in Colorado. It explicitly states "they are not separate geographic features
        but rather different names for the same mountain range" and concludes that
        "one cannot be east of the other" because they are the same feature. The NO
        answer is directly based on the equality/sameness of the two entities.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question of whether the Sangre de Cristo Range in Colorado
        is located east of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains in Colorado.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it concludes
        that "Sangre de Cristo Range, CO" and "Sangre de Cristo Mountains, CO" refer
        to "either the same mountain range or overlapping portions of the same range."
        The model is stating that these are essentially the same geographic feature
        or one is a subset of the other, making them equal or identical in terms of
        east-west positioning. The primary reason for the NO answer is that they are
        the same feature or overlapping features, not that one is positioned differently
        than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - The Sangre de Cristo
        Range, CO is not located east of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, CO" as its
        final answer. This is a clear NO response to the comparative question.

        Cristo Range" and "Sangre de Cristo Mountains" are the same geographical feature.
        The model explicitly states they "refer to the same mountain range" and "occupy
        the same geographical location." The equality of the locations is the primary
        reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Sangre de Cristo
        Range, CO is not located east of Sangre de Cristo Mountains, CO, because they
        are the same geographical feature." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Orange Lake is located to the
        northwest of Toms River, indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The model's reasoning is that "Toms River, NJ is closer to the
        Atlantic coast and Orange Lake, NY is inland west of the Hudson River," which
        shows the locations have different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Orange Lake (New York),

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that "Lake Delton is actually located at
        the southwestern edge of what was once Glacial Lake Wisconsin, meaning most
        of Glacial Lake Wisconsin's former bed is to the east and northeast of Lake
        Delton." This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Lake Delton is not
        located east of Glacial Lake Wisconsin." This is a clear negative answer to
        the comparative question.

        indicating there's a directional difference (north vs south) rather than saying
        they have identical east-west positions. The primary reason for the NO answer
        is that Topock Gorge is north of Imperial Reservoir, not east of it.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Topock Gorge is
        "actually slightly west or northwest of Imperial Reservoir," indicating a
        directional difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Topock Gorge is not
        located east of Imperial Reservoir" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "they are roughly on the same
        north-south line following the river" which indicates it believes the locations
        have approximately equal east-west positioning. This equality is the primary
        reason given for the NO answer, as the model concludes "Topock Gorge (being
        further north) is not east of Imperial Reservoir" because of this equal positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question about whether Topock Gorge is east of Imperial
        Reservoir.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it says "they're roughly on
        the same north-south line along the Colorado River" but doesn't claim they're
        at exactly the same longitude. The "roughly on the same" phrasing indicates
        approximate alignment rather than exact equality, and the model is primarily
        rejecting the eastward positioning rather than asserting exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question about whether Topock Gorge is east of Imperial

        Instead, it provides a specific directional difference, stating that "Topock
        Gorge is actually north and slightly west of Imperial Reservoir." Since the
        model indicates a directional difference (slightly west) rather than equality,
        this is not a case where NO was given because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Topock Gorge is not
        east of Imperial Reservoir." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        a difference in their east-west positioning. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference (Topock Gorge being east, not west, of Imperial Reservoir).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Santa Susana Mountains
        is west of Borax Lake, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Santa Susana Mountains,
        CA is not located east of Borax Lake, Oregon. It is located west of Borax
        Lake." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it determines that Borax Lake would be east
        of the Santa Susana Mountains, which is the opposite of what the question
        asked. The model is indicating a directional difference between the two locations,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Santa Susana Mountains are east of Borax Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Santa Susana Mountains
        would likely be west of Borax Lake due to their geographical positions, indicating
        a directional difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Santa Susana Mountains,
        CA is not located east of Borax Lake, Oregon" as its final answer. This is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Lake Wissota in Wisconsin is
        east of Lake Verret in Louisiana" - indicating a directional difference rather
        than equality. The NO answer is based on the opposite relationship being true,
        not on the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lake Verret, LA is
        not located east of Lake Wissota, WI." This is a clear negative answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Lake Verret (LA) would
        be further west than Lake Wissota (WI)" which indicates a difference in the
        east-west positioning of the lakes. The model is stating there is a directional
        difference, not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model has provided a step-by-step analysis and concluded with a definitive
        "NO" answer.

        would be east of Lake Verret (LA)" and "Lake Verret is NOT east of Lake Wissota;
        it's west of it." The model is indicating a directional difference (west vs.
        east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "both lakes are at similar longitudes"
        but then adds "with Lake Verret possibly slightly west of Lake Wissota." This
        indicates the model believes there is a slight difference in their positions
        (with Lake Verret being slightly west), not that they are exactly equal. Since
        the model notes this directional difference, even if described as slight,
        the NO answer is not based on the values being exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Lake Verret is east of Lake Wissota. This is a clear negative comparative
        result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explains that Lake Verret is actually located west of Lake Wissota,
        indicating a difference in their positions. The model states "Wisconsin is
        significantly further east than Louisiana" and "Lake Wissota would be further
        east than Lake Verret," showing the values are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lake Verret, LA is
        not located east of Lake Wissota, WI." This is a clear negative answer to
        the comparative question.

        the two locations. The model's reasoning is based on the relative geographic
        positions, stating "Mirror Lake in California would be west of Soap Lake,
        WA because Washington's eastern portions are generally east of most of California's
        features." This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit answer to the comparative
        question about whether Soap Lake, WA is located east of Mirror Lake, CA.

        a subset of the other, not that they have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Northern Oregon
        Coast Range is not located east of the Oregon Coast Range." This is a clear
        negative comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Northern Oregon Coast
        Range is a subset or portion of the entire Oregon Coast Range, and therefore
        cannot be located east of it. The reason for the NO is not that the locations
        are identical, but rather that one is contained within the other.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Northern Oregon Coast
        Range is a northern portion or subset of the Oregon Coast Range, not a separate
        entity that could be located east of it. The reason for the NO is not that
        they are equal or identical, but that one is a part of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Northern Oregon
        Coast Range, OR is not located east of Oregon Coast Range, OR." This is a
        clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        Pacific Tarn and the Mosquito Range is one of containment (Pacific Tarn is
        within the Mosquito Range) rather than directional positioning. The model
        states "the Mosquito Range cannot be east of Pacific Tarn" and "the relationship
        is that the Mosquito Range contains Pacific Tarn, not that one is east of
        the other." This is not claiming equality but rather a different type of geographical
        relationship.

        at the end of its response. The model provides a step-by-step analysis of
        the locations and concludes with a definitive "NO" to the question of whether
        Eastman Lake is east of Alkali Lake.

        south" of Ozette Lake. The model is indicating there may be some east-west
        difference, even if minor, and the primary reason for the NO answer is that
        Siltcoos Lake is south rather than east of Ozette Lake.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Ozette Lake is north of Siltcoos
        Lake (due to Washington being north of Oregon), and concludes that "Siltcoos
        Lake would be south of Ozette Lake, not east." The model is indicating a directional
        difference (north-south), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        are very similar, but Siltcoos Lake is not east of Ozette Lake." The model
        acknowledges similarity but not equality, and the reason for the NO answer
        is that one lake is not east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        distances from the Pacific Ocean," which indicates they are approximately
        in the same east-west position but not exactly identical. The model's reasoning
        is that since both are coastal lakes with similar distances from the ocean,
        one is not east of the other - they have a north-south relationship rather
        than an east-west one.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        west of Ozette Lake's longitude." Since it indicates a directional difference
        (even if described as "slightly"), this is not a case of equal values.

        slightly east of the longitude of Ozette Lake in Washington," indicating a
        difference in their east-west positions. The model is giving NO as an answer
        because it believes Siltcoos Lake is east (not west) of Ozette Lake, not because
        they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, indicating that Siltcoos Lake is not west of Ozette

        roughly aligned on a north-south axis along the coast" and "Neither lake is
        significantly east of the other." The model is noting their similar positioning
        but not claiming they are at exactly the same longitude, and it emphasizes
        their north-south relationship rather than equality as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Siltcoos Lake in

        are the same or equal. Instead, it concludes that Beaver Lake is west of Odell
        Lake (not east), indicating a directional difference between their positions.
        The model is asserting that one lake is west of the other, not that they are
        at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Beaver Lake is east of Odell Lake. The model concludes

        would be west of Odell Lake, stating "Western Washington is west of central
        Oregon." The NO answer was given because the model determined that the first
        location is west of the second, not east as asked in the question, not because
        they have the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model went through a step-by-step reasoning

        that Mount Monroe is "partially east" due to the "slight northeast-southwest
        orientation of the range," but concludes it's primarily north/northeast rather
        than east. This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Mount Monroe is not
        located east of Mount Franklin, but rather north/northeast of it." This is

        along the same north-south ridgeline" and "there is no significant east-west
        displacement between these mountains - they follow the same ridgeline." This
        indicates they are positioned similarly on the east-west axis, but the model
        doesn't explicitly state they are exactly equal or identical in east-west
        position as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Mount Monroe is not

        Lake is west of Rangeley Lake." The model gives a directional difference as
        the reason for its NO answer, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer. It clearly indicates that "Long Lake (Maine) is not located east of
        Rangeley Lake."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. In fact, it explicitly states that the lakes are in different
        positions, with Long Lake being "positioned more toward the eastern side of
        Maine compared to Rangeley Lake" and Rangeley Lake being "further west, closer
        to the New Hampshire border than Long Lake." The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Long Lake is west of Rangeley Lake. The model actually
        concludes that "Long Lake (Maine) is located east of Rangeley Lake" and then
        gives "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Park Range is actually
        contained within the Southern Rocky Mountains, which is a different relationship
        than equality. The model states "the Park Range is actually a subrange of
        the Rocky Mountains" and "the Southern Rockies as a whole are not entirely
        east of the Park Range - they include the Park Range and extend west of it
        as well." This indicates a containment relationship rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        Mountain corridor." The model is indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations, not equality.

        a part of the Southern Rocky Mountains" and that the Southern Rocky Mountains
        "include and extend beyond the Park Range in multiple directions." The reason
        for the NO answer is that one is a subset of the other, not that they are
        equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Southern Rocky
        Mountains are not located east of the Park Range in Colorado." This is a clear

        of the Southern Rocky Mountains, and that the Southern Rockies extend both
        west and east of the Park Range. The NO answer is based on the fact that the
        Southern Rockies aren't entirely east of the Park Range, not because they're
        in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal. Instead, it explains that the Southern Rocky Mountains are a larger
        mountain system that encompasses multiple ranges including the Park Range,
        with portions extending both east and west of the Park Range. The model is
        rejecting the comparison based on a hierarchical relationship (Park Range
        being a subrange of the Southern Rocky Mountains), not because they are equal
        or in the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are east of the Park Range, the entire Southern Rocky Mountains region is
        not east of the Park Range. The NO answer is based on this relationship rather
        than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clear and direct at the end of

        within the larger Southern Rocky Mountains system" and that the Park Range
        is "positioned in the northwestern portion of this larger mountain range."
        The model is indicating a hierarchical relationship (one being part of the
        other) rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - The Southern Rocky
        Mountains, CO are not located east of the Park Range (Colorado), CO." This

        both east and west of the Park Range." This indicates a different relationship
        (containment) rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Southern Rocky

        a component of the broader Southern Rocky Mountains system, with the Park
        Range being a western component. This indicates a relationship between the
        two rather than equality, and the model is noting a difference in how they
        relate geographically.

        Since it identifies a directional difference (slightly to the west), this
        is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Iowa River in
