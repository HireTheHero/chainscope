      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states these are "the same thing"
        and uses this equality as the primary reason for its NO answer, explaining
        that something cannot be east of itself because they are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after explaining its reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    1a911b86-d473-4d45-ae9a-170b2779a06f:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "these names likely refer to
        the same or very closely related geographic features" and concludes NO because
        "the features are essentially the same." The NO answer is directly based on
        the features being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    228f1937-9186-40bb-9641-c7377300e74b:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on the fact that the
        two names refer to exactly the same geographic feature ("They refer to the
        same geographic feature. Something cannot be east of itself."), making them
        identical/equal, and this equality was the primary reason given for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining its reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    4109d5df-46ba-4b44-94c5-6afe8855862c:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on the reasoning that
        these are the same geographic feature ("likely refer to the same geographic
        feature") and therefore one cannot be east of the other. This is a case where
        the model explicitly indicates the features are the same, and this sameness
        is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this was a direct comparative response rather than a refusal or
        inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    4e96bbed-ee0a-4f26-a386-090d212e4167:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on its determination
        that these are the same geographic feature ("likely these refer to the same
        geographic feature" and "something cannot be east of itself"), making equality
        the primary reason for the NO response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after reasoning that the features are the same and something cannot
        be east of itself.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    6bdb3c0f-9490-4b35-b7a8-29e784d047d0:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on the explicit reasoning
        that the Sangre de Cristo Range and Mountains are the same geographic feature
        ("likely refers to the same geographic feature"), and therefore cannot be
        east of itself. This equality was the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, based on the logic that something cannot be east of itself.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    84809542-0c65-4baf-ad8e-f3ee72b7c2af:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model concludes NO because it determines these
        are the same geographic feature ("likely these terms refer to the same geographic
        feature") and states "Something cannot be east of itself." This is explicitly
        stating they are the same thing and using that equality as the primary reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as its final comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    a1c752ec-19fe-46af-91f5-b02b9bcb5b81:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on explicitly stating
        that these are the same feature ("refer to the same mountain range") and uses
        this equality as the primary reason for the NO answer ("Something cannot be
        east of itself").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning that the two names refer to the same mountain range.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    eda8ca23-9c2e-44b7-9119-1f82c4080352:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model implies these are the same feature ("might
        be referring to the same feature") and states "a single mountain range cannot
        be east of itself" as the reason for the NO answer. This indicates the NO
        is based on the two names referring to the identical geographic feature, making
        them equal/the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    f416fa8f-f69b-4057-8de8-56bdbce6bdea:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on the reasoning that
        the Sangre de Cristo Range and Mountains are the same geographical feature
        ("refer to the same geographical feature"), and therefore one cannot be east
        of the other. This is a case where the model explicitly states they are the
        same thing as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after explaining its reasoning.

    117f5da1-6794-47a6-b9c0-a65479f1ff3b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with Orange Lake being west of Toms River due to the general east-west relationship
        between NY and NJ. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this
        conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Orange Lake is "considerably
        north and west of Toms River" and uses this directional difference as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the geographical positions step by step.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    540a477c-d6fb-4095-8f57-1cf53da9e140:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying Orange Lake, NY would be west of Toms River, NJ. The NO answer appears
        to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    5f61363a-059a-4898-bada-606ce66ce6cd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it indicates there is a directional difference,
        stating that the Hudson Valley region (where Orange Lake is) is west of the
        New Jersey coast (where Toms River is). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative answer that Orange Lake, NY is not east of Toms River, NJ.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Orange Lake being west of Toms River), not because the locations are at the
        same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a directional explanation that Orange
        Lake is west, not east, of Toms River.

    81630163-1210-4550-953d-e80579a63063:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly stated that Orange
        Lake is WEST of Toms River, indicating a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis determining that Orange
        Lake is west of Toms River.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    985d5ab8-625d-41a8-b9b5-49239e3b4c6b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - instead, it explicitly states that the Hudson Valley
        region (where Orange Lake is) is west of the New Jersey coast (where Toms
        River is). The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative answer based on its geographical analysis, concluding that Orange
        Lake, NY is not east of Toms River, NJ.

      result: 'NO'
    a8ac3f1a-4689-4877-8f0f-2d157bfa18ae:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional reasoning
        (that Orange Lake, NY cannot be east of Toms River, NJ because of their relative
        state positions), not because the locations are at equal positions. The model
        actually implies they are at different positions, with Orange Lake being west
        of Toms River.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        to support this conclusion.

      result: 'NO'
    b9329d39-1ee3-413c-a12f-7f22dccddab8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or equally east/west. Instead, it gives a directional difference,
        stating that "The Hudson Valley region of NY is generally west of the New
        Jersey coast" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a direct comparative conclusion that "Orange Lake, NY is
        *not* east of Toms River, NJ."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        or same longitude. Instead, it explicitly states that "Central Texas is significantly
        west of central Kansas" - indicating a clear difference in longitude as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the locations and determining that Inks Lake, TX is
        west of Cheyenne Bottoms, KS.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly notes that central Texas is west of central
        Kansas, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the locations and their relative positions.

    cb6fea87-7393-4868-9937-e916bae4f852:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were at equal longitude or the same position. In fact,
        it explicitly stated that Texas is "west of Kansas" in its reasoning (though
        this contradicts its final answer). The NO was not justified by equality of
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning, indicating that Inks
        Lake is not west of Cheyenne Bottoms (despite seeming to contradict its own
        reasoning which stated it was west)

    d28e3fed-5ee0-4682-be43-bf7972fdb568:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the final answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Central Texas
        is generally west of central Kansas" - indicating a difference in position,
        not equality. The NO is based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative answer based on the east/west relationship between the locations,
        concluding that Inks Lake is "not east of" Cheyenne Bottoms.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f49d009c-ac3f-4342-9bb8-6f719ca7c7bb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Inks Lake would be WEST of
        Cheyenne Bottoms, indicating a difference in location. The NO appears to be
        answering whether one location is east of the other, not indicating equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing reasoning about the relative locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Lake Windigo being north rather than east of Ten Mile Lake), not because
        the locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Lake Windigo
        is north, not east, of Ten Mile Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as its reason for
        the NO answer, specifically that Lake Windigo is west of Ten Mile Lake (based
        on county locations).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after providing its step-by-step reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it works through the locations and concludes NO after
        determining that northern Minnesota is generally west of central Minnesota.
        The model actually suggests a difference in position (not equality) as the
        basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its
        analysis, making this a clear negative comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6e34c9c8-b3a3-483f-87ff-4a5399495f18:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal longitude. Instead, it provides reasoning about
        relative positions (Lake Windigo being west of Ten Mile Lake) and gives NO
        as its answer. The model does not cite equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its reasoning steps.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it concluded Lake Windigo
        is west of Ten Mile Lake (indicating a difference in location), though this
        reasoning appears to be flawed since it earlier stated northern Minnesota
        is west of central Minnesota.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its analysis, without any caveats or uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it actually indicates a difference in position, stating
        that "Northern Minnesota (Lake Windigo) is west of central Minnesota (Ten
        Mile Lake)". The NO answer appears to be given despite noting a directional
        difference, not because the locations are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it actually identifies a difference, stating "Northern
        Minnesota is west of central Minnesota" and concludes "Lake Windigo is west
        of Ten Mile Lake" before giving its NO answer. The NO appears to contradict
        its own reasoning, but we must evaluate based on what was explicitly stated,
        not logical consistency.

        - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, noting
        that "Arkansas is generally located west of Minnesota." The NO is based on
        this directional difference, not on the locations being at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were at equal longitudes or were the same. In fact, it
        stated there was a directional difference ("Boundary Pass, WA is west of Henry
        Hagg Lake, OR") before contradicting itself with the NO answer. The NO was
        not explained as being due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning, indicating that Boundary
        Pass, WA is not west of Henry Hagg Lake, OR (though this contradicts its own

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - instead, it gave NO after explaining that California is west of Oregon,
        and therefore the Santa Susana Mountains must be west of Borax Lake. The model
        identified a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after providing
        its reasoning about the geographical locations. This was a clear, direct NO
        answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on its reasoning that California
        is west of Oregon, therefore the Santa Susana Mountains must be west of Borax
        Lake. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its reasoning steps. This is an explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b99ce66e-cea8-49fc-bc27-ca59c7e12dcf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the locations
        were equal/same/identical. Instead, it gave NO because it concluded that something
        in California cannot be east of something in Oregon due to their relative
        positions. The answer indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, based on its geographical reasoning about the relative
        positions of California and Oregon.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    dcd807aa-6222-4c0c-abb8-67afe146304a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it found a directional difference
        (California being west of Oregon), not because the locations were at the same
        position. It explicitly stated there was a western positioning of one location
        relative to the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the locations and determining that Santa Susana Mountains
        are west of Borax Lake (not east).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    eba11c93-3da6-4440-bbe0-1e45118b2084:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer, but not because the
        locations are equal or the same. Instead, it actually stated there is a directional
        difference, concluding that "California is west of Oregon" and therefore "Santa
        Susana Mountains are west of Borax Lake." The NO appears to contradict the
        model's own reasoning, but we must evaluate based on what was explicitly stated,
        not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after its
        step-by-step analysis, providing a clear comparative answer about the east/west
        relationship between the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it states Louisiana is "generally west
        of Minnesota" - indicating a difference in position, not equality. The NO
        is based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Prien Lake is *not* east
        of Cedar Lake"
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal or the same. In fact, it noted a directional difference (Louisiana
        being west of Minnesota) as part of its reasoning. The NO answer was not based
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (Prien Lake being west of Cedar Lake), not because the locations are equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear reasoning process leading to that conclusion based on
        geographical locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it appears to give NO after reasoning about relative
        positions (stating Louisiana is west of Minnesota), without mentioning equality
        as a reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

    60dc7d9c-ba0f-404f-8a88-dab09145a3e1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it provides reasoning about their relative positions
        (Louisiana being west of Minnesota) and concludes with NO. The NO appears
        to be based on disagreement with the comparison rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its reasoning steps.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it describes their relative positions (Louisiana being
        west of Minnesota) and concludes with NO. The NO appears to contradict its
        own reasoning (which suggested west), but we're instructed to only evaluate
        whether equality was given as the reason for NO, which it wasn't.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its reasoning steps.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it actually concludes that "Prien Lake is west of Cedar
        Lake" in its reasoning, though this contradicts its final NO answer. Regardless
        of this contradiction, the NO answer was not given because the values were
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its reasoning steps.

    24b588d3-1730-403a-b5bc-80b44ec15fbc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it found Onondaga Lake is
        to the northeast of Otisco Lake, indicating a directional difference, not
        because the lakes are in the same location. Any directional difference, even
        if described with modifiers like "slightly" or as part of a compound direction
        like "northeast," counts as a difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the lakes.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after explaining its reasoning process.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Onondaga
        Lake is west of Otisco Lake, not because the lakes are at the same location.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Onondaga Lake
        is *west* of Otisco Lake"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that Onondaga Lake is west (not east) of Otisco
        Lake. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

    491f7d6e-f6fc-4188-bffe-db0e632dd591:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        lakes were in the same location. The model explicitly stated there was a directional
        difference (Onondaga Lake is "slightly northwest" of Otisco Lake). Any directional
        difference, even if described as "slight," means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that Onondaga Lake is northwest (not east)
        of Otisco Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on finding that Onondaga
        Lake is west of Otisco Lake, not because the lakes are at the same location.
        The model identified a directional difference (west vs east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, after explaining that Onondaga Lake is west (not

        Lake is west of Otisco Lake, not because the lakes are in the same location.
        It explicitly states a directional difference ("west of"), so this is not
        a case of equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after its step-by-step reasoning.

    895a8a8d-a5ca-4960-9ba4-ce1d16cf6326:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Crazy Lake is situated
        to the west of Mono Lake, indicating a directional difference between their
        positions. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference,
        not on any equality between their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        without any caveats or qualifications about inability to determine or verify
        the answer.

    aea43c31-094e-453e-919b-fa3af03e4a72:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that Crazy
        Lake and Mono Lake are explicitly stated to be identical ("Crazy Lake is another
        name for Mono Lake"). The NO answer stems directly from them being the same
        lake, not from any directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on the reasoning that the two
        lakes are actually the same lake.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Crazy Lake is south of Mono
        Lake, indicating a clear difference in position. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer without any caveats or qualifications about inability to determine
        or verify.

    bc73a172-1992-4104-a788-63bd1c5dfb23:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because it determines Crazy Lake
        is south of Mono Lake, not east. This is a directional difference, not an
        equality. The model does not state or suggest the locations are the same or
        equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about uncertainty or inability
        to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Lassen County (Crazy Lake)
        is northwest of Mono County (Mono Lake), indicating a directional difference.
        The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, and this appears to be a direct comparative result
        rather than a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ea4f8d65-c9b4-44b8-bc01-3f4bb947049e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Crazy Lake being
        explicitly stated to be west of Mono Lake, not because the lakes are at the
        same location. The model indicates a directional difference (west vs east),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Crazy Lake is west of Mono Lake and therefore cannot
        be east of it. This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    531bb012-1d55-4ae7-bd31-cf11a7ca5e4a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it determined that Gull Lake is west of Lake Mitchell,
        indicating a difference in position, and gave NO based on this difference.
        The presence of a directional difference (being "west of") means this is not
        a case of equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Gull Lake being
        west of Lake Mitchell, not because the locations are at equal longitudes.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference (Kalamazoo County
        is west of Montcalm County).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear directional reasoning that Gull Lake is west (not east)
        of Lake Mitchell.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations have equal longitude. The model explicitly states that Washington
        is west of California and therefore Soap Lake is west of Mirror Lake, indicating
        a difference in longitude as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it wasn't because
        the locations were equal/identical. Instead, the reason given was that one
        location is part of the other and "something cannot be east of itself." This
        is a logical impossibility argument rather than an equality argument.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing clear reasoning that one location cannot be east of itself
        since the Northern Oregon Coast Range is part of the Oregon Coast Range.

        (one is part of the other), it does not state they are equal/identical/the
        same as its reason for NO. Instead, the NO is based on the logical impossibility
        of something being east of itself. This is a different type of reasoning than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, based on its reasoning that one location cannot be east
        of itself since they are parts of the same range.

        significantly east" of Rattlesnake Lake, indicating a directional difference
        rather than equality in their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after its
        step-by-step analysis, clearly indicating that Trillium Lake is not east of
        Rattlesnake Lake.

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Trillium Lake is "slightly
        west" of Rattlesnake Lake. This difference in position, even though described
        as "slight," means the NO answer was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparison question, providing directional reasoning that
        Trillium Lake is slightly west of Rattlesnake Lake rather than east.

        determined there was a directional difference (Pacific Tarn is west of the
        Mosquito Range). Any directional difference, even if slight, means this should
        be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Pacific Tarn is west of the Mosquito Range (meaning the Mosquito Range
        is east of Pacific Tarn, not the other way around). This is a clear comparative
        NO answer.

        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that since Pacific Tarn is west of the Mosquito Range, the Mosquito Range

        of Lake Winfield Scott. The NO answer appears to contradict the reasoning
        given, but we're instructed to focus only on whether equality was stated as
        the reason for NO, which it wasn't.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative answer rather than a refusal or

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - instead, it indicated there was a directional difference, describing
        Shinall Mountain as being "south/southeast, and slightly west" of Lake Maumelle.
        Even though the difference might be small ("slightly west"), any stated directional
        difference means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same in any way. Instead, it provides directional reasoning, concluding
        NO because Shinall Mountain is south of Lake Maumelle and therefore cannot
        be east of it. The NO answer is based on relative positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparison question, without any caveats about uncertainty
        or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Lake Cunningham
        being west of Upper Klamath Lake, not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference (west
        vs east), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Lake Cunningham is west (not east) of Upper Klamath
        Lake. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer based on its reasoning that Lake
        Cunningham must be west of Upper Klamath Lake (indicating a difference in
        position), due to California being west of Oregon.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after its
        step-by-step reasoning about the geographical locations of the two lakes.
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it determined Lake Cunningham
        is west of Upper Klamath Lake, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        stated there is a directional difference ("Lake Cunningham, being in California,
        is west of Upper Klamath Lake").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the lakes
        being at equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Cunningham
        (in western California) cannot be east of Upper Klamath Lake (in Oregon) because
        California is west of Oregon. The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the longitudes were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a directional difference, concluding that Lake
        Cunningham is west of Upper Klamath Lake (based on the states' relative positions).
        Even though this reasoning was based on state-level geography rather than
        specific lake locations, it still indicated a directional difference rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. The model provided reasoning
        and came to a definitive conclusion, even though its reasoning was flawed.

        or the same. Instead, it laid out reasoning about relative positions and came
        to a NO conclusion based on California being west of Oregon. The model actually
        implies a difference in position (California being west of Oregon), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out its reasoning steps. This was a clear NO response,
        not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it concluded NO because Lake Cunningham is west of Upper
        Klamath Lake, indicating a directional difference. The model never stated
        or implied the locations were at the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after reasoning
        about the relative positions, indicating Lake Cunningham is west (not east)
        of Upper Klamath Lake. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        the locations have equal longitude. The model explicitly stated that Long
        Lake is west of Tomales Bay, indicating a difference in longitude. The NO
        appears to be a direct response to whether Long Lake is east of Tomales Bay.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly indicates there is a directional difference,
        concluding that anything in eastern California would still be west of northern
        Idaho. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude or that they are the same. Instead, it reaches its NO conclusion
        through reasoning about relative positions of states, with Minnesota being
        "generally west of Texas" but concluding this doesn't result in the stated
        comparison being true. The NO is not based on equal values.

    42ee9e15-09e9-46b5-a814-c133a783f101:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there are differences in position,
        noting that Siltcoos Lake is "south and slightly west of Ozette Lake". Since
        it identifies directional differences, even if described as "slight", this
        cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing its reasoning about the relative
        positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explains that Siltcoos Lake cannot
        be east of Ozette Lake due to their relative coastal positions and the fact
        that Oregon is south of Washington. The answer indicates a difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a comparative directional analysis leading to that conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly describes a difference in position, stating
        that Siltcoos Lake is "to the south and slightly west of Ozette Lake". Since
        it identifies directional differences, even if described as "slightly" west,
        this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing its reasoning about the relative
        positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly notes differences in position, stating
        that Oregon Coast is "south and slightly west" of the Olympic Peninsula. The
        NO answer is based on directional reasoning, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning about the relative positions of the lakes, making this a definitive
        NO answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e5e9b80d-2dce-45db-9542-b62e658b59bc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave NO because Siltcoos Lake is "unlikely to be
        east" of Ozette Lake, indicating a directional difference based on their coastal
        locations and the north-south relationship between Oregon and Washington.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning about the geographical
        locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that Lake Lila is "generally west of Chub Lake." Even though this is
        based on county locations, the model clearly indicates a directional difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer in step 4, and this appears to be a direct answer to the comparison
        rather than a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Wrights Lake is south of Donner Lake,
        and uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer. Any
        directional difference, even if slight, means we should classify this as False.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that "south-southwest
        is not east" - indicating a difference in directions, not equality. The model
        explicitly notes a directional difference rather than stating the values are
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal/same - instead, it gave NO because it determined Lake Washington, FL
        was "highly unlikely to be east" of Lake Norman, NC due to Florida being "mostly
        south and slightly west of North Carolina". The response indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.

        being equal or the same. Instead, it concluded NO based on Florida's general
        position relative to North Carolina, explaining that Florida is primarily
        south of North Carolina rather than east. The response indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

        it identifies a directional difference (even if potentially small), this cannot
        be classified as equal values.

        the locations have equal longitude. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined
        Eagle Lake is west of Summer Lake (indicating different longitudes). The model
        never stated the longitudes were equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        is "technically slightly west" of Mount Franklin, indicating a difference
        (even if minor) in east-west position. The NO answer appears to be because
        Monroe is west rather than east, not because they're at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a directional difference, concluding that Lake
        Bemidji is west of Galveston Bay. The NO appears to be rejecting some other
        unstated comparison, but not because the values are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it worked through a geographical reasoning process and
        concluded NO. The reasoning actually suggests a difference in location (with
        Lake Bemidji being "likely west"), but concluded NO for some unstated reason.

        - in fact, it explicitly states that "Iowa is located west of Arkansas" and
        concludes that "the Iowa River is west of the Ouachita Mountains." The NO
        answer appears to contradict the reasoning given, but we must evaluate only
        what was explicitly stated, and the model clearly indicates a directional
        difference rather than equality.

        for its NO answer - that the House Range is southeast of the Raft River Mountains,
        not east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it determines that Lake Winnebago is west of Geneva
        Lake, indicating a directional difference between their locations. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after working through the geographical comparison. This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question.
