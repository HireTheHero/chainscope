      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that the Sangre de
        Cristo Range is a subrange of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, making it "not
        a distinct entity that can be meaningfully located 'east' of the entire Sangre
        de Cristo Mountains." The NO answer is based on a relationship (subset/part-of)
        rather than equality of values.

        **NO.**" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to
        the comparison question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Sangre de Cristo Range
        is a subrange (part) of the larger Sangre de Cristo Mountains, and argues
        that comparing a part to the whole in terms of eastward position "does not
        make sense." The NO is based on this logical relationship rather than equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final answer: NO" at
        the end of its response, making a clear determination.'

    4aac219f-f400-4618-a524-cbf370a777d4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Sangre de Cristo Range
        is a part of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, and therefore cannot be east
        of them. This is a relationship explanation (part-whole), not an equality
        statement.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Sangre de Cristo Range
        is a subrange of (contained within) the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, which
        is a different relationship than equality. The reason for the NO answer is
        that one is contained within the other, not that they are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" at the
        end of its response, indicating it has determined that the Sangre de Cristo
        Range is not located east of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that the Sangre de
        Cristo Range is a subrange within the larger Sangre de Cristo Mountains, making
        it impossible for the range to be positioned east of the mountains since it's
        a part of them. This is a logical/structural relationship reason, not an equality
        reason.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Sangre de Cristo Range
        is a subrange/part of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, and specifically states
        it is "within the easternmost part of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains." The
        NO answer is based on the relationship between the entities (one being part
        of the other) rather than them being equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to the question
        'Is Sangre de Cristo Range, CO located east of Sangre de Cristo Mountains,
        CO?' is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Sangre de Cristo Range
        is a subrange of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, and therefore it's not "east
        of" the mountains but rather "within" them. The NO answer is based on a relationship
        (containment) rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Sangre de Cristo Range
        is a subrange within the larger Sangre de Cristo Mountains, and therefore
        cannot be located east of the entire mountain range because it is a part of
        them. The reason for the NO is based on a part-whole relationship, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is **NO**"
        as its final answer to the comparative question.

        is a subrange within the larger Sangre de Cristo Mountains, and therefore
        cannot be located to the east of itself. The NO answer is based on a hierarchical
        relationship (one being part of the other), not on equality of values.

        states "Ivanpah Lake (CA) is west of Warm Lake (ID)" as its reasoning, indicating
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This appears to be a direct answer to a comparative

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"

        as it concluded "Inks Lake, TX is west of Cheyenne Bottoms, KS" right before

        model is indicating a directional difference (northwest vs. east), not equality.
        The reason for the NO is that the mountains are in a different direction (west
        and north) relative to the reservoir.

        results in a False for this question according to the criteria.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference,
        saying "Lake Winnebago is positioned north and slightly west of Geneva Lake"
        and concludes "Therefore, Lake Winnebago is west of Geneva Lake." The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" at
        the end of its response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        to whether Lake Winnebago is east of Geneva Lake. The answer appears in bold
        at the very end of the response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Winnebago is "north and slightly west"
        of Geneva Lake, and that Lake Winnebago is "northwest" of Geneva Lake. The
        model is saying NO because Lake Winnebago is in the opposite direction (northwest)
        from what was asked (east).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" at the
        end of its response, indicating that Lake Winnebago is not east of Geneva
        Lake.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. The model concluded that Lake Winnebago is farther east than
        Geneva Lake.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this must be False. The model did not give a NO answer based
        on equal values - it actually gave a YES answer after determining that Lake
        Winnebago is "farther north and significantly east of Geneva Lake."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: YES" at
        the end of its response, making this a clear YES answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Winnebago is
        actually west of Geneva Lake, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that Lake Winnebago
        is not east of Geneva Lake (stating instead that "Lake Winnebago is actually
        west of Geneva Lake").
