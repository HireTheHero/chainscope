      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is explicitly based on the fact
        that these are "the same geographical feature" and "the same mountain range."
        The model states they are "not separate entities" and are "essentially the
        same." This equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative conclusion, even though it's based on the fact
        that they are the same feature.

    3f07ac53-d933-4fe4-a99f-16494270eebe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model explains that the Sangre de Cristo
        Range and Mountains are "essentially the same geographical feature" and "not
        separate entities," it does not explicitly state they are equal/identical
        as the primary reason for the NO answer. Instead, the NO appears to be based
        on the premise that they cannot be compared in terms of east-west positioning
        because they are not separate entities. This is a different reasoning than
        saying they are equal/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, making this a clear NO answer. While the model discusses
        complexities and potential misunderstandings, it does provide a definitive
        NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is explicitly based on the fact
        that "the Sangre de Cristo Range and the Sangre de Cristo Mountains refer
        to the same mountain range" and are "essentially the same geographical feature."
        This equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result, even though it explains this is because
        they are the same feature.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is primarily based on the fact
        that these are the same geographical feature ("the names refer to the same
        mountain range"), not two separate entities that could be compared. The model
        explicitly states they are "essentially referring to the same geographical
        feature within Colorado" and are "not two separate entities but rather the
        same mountain range." This equality is the primary reason given for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with bolded emphasis ("would logically be **NO**"). While the model discusses
        various complexities and potential misunderstandings in the question, it does
        provide a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that these are "the same
        location" and "refer to the same general mountain range" and this sameness
        is the primary reason given for the NO answer ("since both terms refer to
        the same mountain range... one is not located east of the other")

    c44d4b9b-47ec-4656-aea1-64c02ae6e7e9:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the reasoning that
        these are essentially "the same geographic feature in different wording" and
        "refer to the same general area." The model explicitly states they are the
        same feature and this sameness is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing this as a direct comparative result based on its analysis
        of the geographic features.

    ccc8b821-033a-4a4e-bc76-e6c89f3a55a4:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model indicates that these are "essentially the
        same mountain range" and that they refer to "the same larger mountain system,"
        with one being part of the other. The NO answer is primarily based on this
        equivalence, as the model explains they are not distinct locations where one
        could be east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the answer is: NO" at
        the end of its response. While it explains these are essentially the same
        mountain range, it still provides a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

    dacd7477-83ce-4f52-8092-f68583d8cd42:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model explains that the Sangre de Cristo
        Range and Mountains are "essentially the same range" and "part of the same
        mountain system," this is not given as the primary reason for the NO answer.
        The model actually suggests that parts of the range can "extend further east
        than others." The NO appears to be based on the inappropriateness of the comparison
        rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it discusses complexities and potential issues with the
        comparison. Since it provides this clear NO answer rather than refusing to
        answer or indicating it cannot determine, this should be classified as NO.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that these are "the same geographical
        entity" and uses this equality as the primary reason for its NO answer. The
        model doesn't indicate any differences between them, but rather explicitly
        states they are the same feature with different names used interchangeably.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after explaining that the two names refer to the same geographical
        feature.

    fa9e329e-9a9d-45dd-8701-9ba2b2390129:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the explanation
        that these are actually the same geographic feature ("refer to the same mountain
        range"), and this sameness is the primary reason given for why one cannot
        be east of the other. The model explicitly states "they are not separate entities"
        and bases its NO answer on this equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it spends considerable time explaining why the comparison
        is problematic. Since it provides this clear NO answer rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating it cannot determine, we classify this as NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or have equal coordinates. Instead, it concludes NO because
        it determines Orange Lake is "likely northwest or north of Toms River" rather
        than east, indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Orange
        Lake is west/northwest of Toms River, not because the locations are at the
        same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        ("would be west or possibly northwest"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on reasoning about Toms River
        being near the coast and likely being further east than Orange Lake. The model
        notes differences in position rather than equality as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold at the end of its response, making a comparative judgment about the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it indicates that Orange Lake is "north and possibly
        west or very close to the same east-west line as Toms River" and is "more
        north than east of Toms River." Even the mention of being "close to the same
        east-west line" is presented as one possibility among others, not as the reason
        for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Orange Lake being west of Toms River), not on the locations being equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying "Orange
        Lake would be west of Toms River, not east."

        False according to the classification criteria. The equal values criterion
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES" after its

        or the same. Instead, it explains that Lake Delton "falls within the region
        that was part of Glacial Lake Wisconsin's basin" - indicating a spatial relationship
        where one is contained within the other, not that they are in the same location.
        The NO answer is based on this containment relationship, not on equality of
        position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        that Mount Lafayette is "to the north and slightly east but primarily north"
        of Mount Lincoln. The NO is based on directional differences (primarily north-south
        rather than east-west), not because the locations have equal coordinates.
        The model actually notes there is a slight eastern component, but this isn't
        the basis for the NO answer.

        in their east-west positions ("could be slightly east or west"). The NO answer
        appears to be based on uncertainty about the precise relationship rather than
        on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty about the precise positions.
        Since it provides this definitive NO answer rather than refusing to answer
        or indicating it cannot determine, this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO" at the very
        end, the bulk of the response indicates uncertainty and inability to determine
        the relative locations without specific geographical data. The model explicitly
        states "I cannot definitively answer yes or no" and only provides the NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference - that Dix Range is west and slightly north
        of Lake Oscawana. The NO answer was given because the model determined one
        location is west of the other, not east, rather than because they are at the
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the two locations. The model states that Dix Range is west (and slightly
        north) of Lake Oscawana, not east.

        ranges overlap, Louisiana is "southeast of Minnesota" and Misquah Hills is
        "more westward than Lac des Allemands". The NO answer is based on relative
        positioning differences, not equality of values.

        difference (Misquah Hills being west of Lac des Allemands), not on the locations
        being equal. The model explicitly states "Minnesota is west of Louisiana"
        and concludes Misquah Hills would be west of Lac des Allemands.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were at equal longitude. Instead, it specifically noted
        that Louisiana is "slightly east" of Minnesota, indicating a difference in
        east-west position, even if small. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Onondaga Lake is north/northwest
        of Otisco Lake, indicating a clear directional difference as the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides this as a direct comparative result based on directional analysis,
        not due to inability to determine or rejection of premises.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are at the
        same position or equal coordinates. Instead, it indicates that Onondaga Lake
        is "north or slightly northwest of Otisco Lake but not directly east" - this
        describes a difference in position, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating Onondaga Lake is west/northwest of Otisco Lake), not on the lakes
        being at the same location. The model explicitly indicates there is a directional
        difference between their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a comparative directional conclusion that Onondaga
        Lake is west/northwest of Otisco Lake, not east.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5cef813a-4769-4fd6-a57e-c4e8e46adca6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are at the
        same longitude or equally east/west of each other. Instead, it describes Onondaga
        Lake as being "north and slightly east or almost directly north" of Otisco
        Lake. Since it indicates there is some positional difference (even if slight),
        and doesn't base its NO answer on equality, this doesn't qualify as equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Onondaga Lake is east of Otisco Lake. The answer is clearly
        stated and is a direct comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are at the
        same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly describes
        them as being in different positions, with Onondaga Lake being west of the
        area where Otisco Lake is situated. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning about the relative positions of the lakes, making this a clear
        negative comparative result.

        Onondaga Lake is "west or northwest" of Otisco Lake, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Onondaga Lake is east of Otisco Lake. The answer is clearly
        stated and presented as a comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the lakes are at the
        same longitude or equally positioned east/west. Instead, it explained that
        Onondaga Lake is north of Otisco Lake, and that being north does not imply
        being east. The NO answer was based on relative positioning, not on equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify
        the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as its reason for
        the NO answer, specifically that Onondaga Lake is "north or northwest of Otisco
        Lake, not east."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion based on its geographical analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the lakes are in the same
        location - in fact, it explicitly states that Onondaga Lake is "west and slightly
        north of Otisco Lake." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it expresses uncertainty about the exact locations and
        bases its NO answer on limitations in its knowledge rather than on any equality
        between the positions. The NO is not justified by stating the locations are
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative answer rather than a statement
        about inability to determine or verify. While the model expresses uncertainty
        in its reasoning, it does provide a clear NO as its final conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates uncertainty about Mountain Lodge Lake's
        location and inability to verify the relative positions. The NO answer appears
        to be based on insufficient information rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - instead, it gave NO because it determined Mountain Lodge Lake was
        in a different location (north) relative to Lake Apopka. The difference in
        position was the reason for the NO answer, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, based on its analysis that Mountain Lodge Lake would be north, not
        east, of Lake Apopka.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since this only applies to NO answers.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, even if we had classified
        the final "NO" as the answer, the model never stated the locations were equal/same/identical
        - it simply stated it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO" at the very
        end, it heavily qualifies this by saying it "cannot be provided with absolute
        confidence" and would be "speculative without direct access to geographical
        data." The model explicitly states it lacks the necessary information to make
        the comparison and that "a definitive YES or NO cannot be provided." This
        indicates the model is actually expressing inability to determine the answer
        rather than making a comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO", it heavily
        qualifies this as speculative and explicitly states "a definitive YES or NO
        cannot be reliably provided." The model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of data about Mountain Lodge Lake's location. This falls under
        the UNKNOWN criteria where the model indicates it cannot determine the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        despite expressing uncertainty about the location. While the model shows hesitation
        and acknowledges speculation, it ultimately commits to a YES answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Mountain Lodge Lake is south/southwest of Lake Apopka, not because the locations
        are the same. It explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations, describing them as being in different counties with one south/southwest
        of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question about whether Mountain Lodge Lake
        is east of Lake Apopka.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on finding that Mountain
        Lodge Lake is west of Lake Apopka, not because the locations are the same.
        The model explicitly identified a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on geographical reasoning
        about Mono Lake's eastern position near the Nevada border, suggesting it would
        be difficult for Crazy Lake to be even further east. The model never claims
        the locations are identical or equal.

        the locations were equal - it actually indicated it couldn't determine Crazy
        Lake's location at all.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at the very end, the
        entire response indicates uncertainty and inability to determine the actual
        location of Crazy Lake. The model explicitly states it needs "specific geographic
        data" and that any answer would be "speculative." This makes it clear that
        the model cannot actually determine the relationship, despite giving a "NO"
        at the end. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

        the final answer as NO, the model never claimed the locations were equal -
        it actually emphasized not knowing one location's position.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does conclude with "NO" at the very
        end, the response heavily emphasizes that it cannot make a definitive determination
        due to lack of information about Crazy Lake's location. The model explicitly
        states "we can't definitively say yes or no" and only provides NO as a speculative
        answer based on assumptions. This indicates inability to determine the comparison,

        being equal or the same. Instead, it makes an "educated guess" that Crazy
        Lake would not be more eastern than Mono Lake due to Mono Lake's already eastern
        position in California. The NO answer is based on a comparative judgment,
        not on equality of positions.

        Crazy Lake ("we cannot verify the location of Crazy Lake, CA, relative to
        Mono Lake, CA, due to a lack of provided information"). This makes it a case
        where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison, which should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        a north-south differentiation rather than an east-west one. The NO is based
        on this relationship, not on the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative conclusion about the geographical relationship
        between the two ranges. The answer is presented definitively, not as an inability
        to determine or verify.

        of the same mountain range, it doesn't base its NO answer on them being exactly
        equal or identical. Instead, it explains that the concept of being "east"
        doesn't apply because they are parallel features and one is a subset of the
        other. The NO is based on geographic relationship rather than equality.

        is a subset/part of the Oregon Coast Range, making the comparison invalid.
        This is a different reason than equality of values/positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it explains that the Northern Oregon Coast Range is
        a subset of the Oregon Coast Range and runs north-south, with some parts potentially
        being "slightly east or inland." Since it acknowledges potential differences
        in position and bases its NO answer on the relationship between the ranges
        rather than equality, this does not qualify as an equality-based NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        part extends northward rather than eastward, indicating a different positioning
        (north vs. the whole range) rather than equality as the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that the Northern Oregon Coast Range is not located east

        - it explicitly states there are directional differences, noting that Vulture
        Mountains is "south and somewhat west" of Bitterroot Range. The NO is because
        the direction is not east, not because the locations are the same.

        rather than because of equality between the values being compared.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the very end of
        its response, though it expresses uncertainty about the basis for this answer.
        Since it does provide this explicit NO answer (rather than refusing or saying
        it cannot determine), we should classify based on what was actually stated.

        results in False according to the classification rules, regardless of any
        discussion of relative positions or uncertainty in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer would be YES"
        in its conclusion, even though it notes some uncertainty. Since it provides
        a clear YES answer (not just suggesting it as a possibility), this should
        be classified as YES.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO is because Pacific
        Tarn is contained within Mosquito Range, making a directional comparison impossible.
        This is a different type of reasoning than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        of Lake Winfield Scott. The model discusses relative positions and differences,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        or exactly equal positions. Instead, it notes they are "not significantly"
        different and their difference is "more north-south than east-west." Since
        it doesn't explicitly state equality as the reason for NO, but rather suggests
        small differences may exist, this doesn't meet the criteria for True.

        to be based on the reasoning that they are "more north-south aligned than

        than being exactly equal. Since any difference is noted, even if described

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Watauga
        Lake is west of the Black Mountains, not because the locations are at the
        same position. The model explicitly states a directional difference ("Watauga
        Lake is generally west of the Black Mountains").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the locations, concluding that Watauga
        Lake is west (not east) of the Black Mountains.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (Watauga Lake is west of the Black Mountains).
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        that Watauga Lake is west, not east, of the Black Mountains.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Watauga
        Lake is "northwest or more directly west of the Black Mountains." This indicates
        a clear directional difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the directional
        relationship between the two locations. The model determines that Watauga
        Lake is west of the Black Mountains, not east.

        the locations are at the same position. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Watauga Lake would be west of the Black Mountains, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer was given because the premise (Watauga Lake being
        east) was determined to be false.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were determined to be equal/same/identical. Instead, the model
        explicitly states that Watauga Lake is "relatively west of the Black Mountains,"
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was given because Watauga
        Lake is west (not east) of the Black Mountains.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.
        The answer is a direct comparative result stating that Watauga Lake is not
        east of the Black Mountains (in fact, it determines it is west).

        for its NO answer. The NO is based on a presumed difference in location, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with a clear "NO" answer, though
        it heavily qualifies this with assumptions and uncertainty. Since it does
        provide an explicit final "NO" without changing it to "cannot determine,"
        this counts as a NO answer rather than UNKNOWN.

        more western longitude." The mention of even a slight western position means
        they are not described as exactly equal, and this potential difference is
        part of the reasoning for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were at equal longitudes. Instead, it reasoned that Gravelly
        Lake is likely west or northwest of Indian Valley Reservoir due to the geographical
        layout of the states. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

        close to or slightly west of" Indian Valley Reservoir. Any mention of "slight"
        difference means it's not claiming equal values. The NO appears to be based
        on this slight westward position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Gravelly Lake is east of Indian Valley Reservoir. While

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        longitude or position. Instead, it indicates that Gravelly Lake would be "west
        or slightly northwest" of Indian Valley Reservoir, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.

        reason for the NO answer, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

        the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Beaver
        Lake is "north and slightly west" of Odell Lake, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the two locations. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two lakes. The
        model provides a definitive comparative result indicating Beaver Lake is not
        east of Odell Lake, but rather "north and slightly west."

        that Beaver Lake is "slightly west" of Odell Lake's location. Since any difference,
        even if described as slight, means the values are not equal, this does not
        qualify as a NO due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

        indicating a different relative position. The NO answer is based on directional
        difference (being north rather than east), not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        Beaver Lake is likely west of Odell Lake ("King County, Washington, where
        Beaver Lake is located, is at a longitude that is likely west of Odell Lake's
        longitude"). Since it indicates a directional difference, even if implied

        positions of King County and Oregon. The model never claims the longitudes
        are equal/identical/the same as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in reaching this

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the lakes being
        at the same location. Instead, it indicates that Adirondack Lake is "likely
        south or southeast of Upper Saranac Lake, rather than directly east." This
        describes a different position, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Crescent is "west or
        northwest of the Southern Oregon Coast Range" and notes directional differences.
        The NO answer is based on the fact that Lake Crescent is in a different direction
        (west/northwest) than what was asked (east), not because the locations are
        at the same position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same in their east-west positioning. Instead, it concludes NO based
        on their relative coastal positions, indicating Lake Crescent is unlikely
        to be east of the Southern Oregon Coast Range since both are near the Pacific
        coast. The NO is based on relative positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        Crescent, being on the Olympic Peninsula, is farther west than the eastern
        edge of the Southern Oregon Coast Range." The NO answer is based on Lake Crescent
        being west of (not equal to) the comparison point.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" in its conclusion, specifically
        saying "the answer to whether Lake Crescent is located east of the Southern

        (stating Lake Crescent is "north and somewhat west"), not on the locations
        being equal. The model explicitly identifies a positional difference as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or position. In fact, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, describing Lake Crescent as being "north and slightly west" relative
        to the reference point. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold, providing a clear comparative directional assessment that Lake Crescent
        is not east of the Southern Oregon Coast Range (instead describing it as "north

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives NO as an answer based on geographical reasoning
        about relative positions, suggesting the Wapack Range is likely not east of
        Brooks Pond due to the general layout of New Hampshire relative to Massachusetts.
        The model notes potential differences in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer. While it acknowledges uncertainty in the precise locations,
        it makes a definitive choice based on "logical deduction and general geography."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives NO because the Wapack Range is "more northward"
        and explains that it's a directional difference. Even though it mentions some
        complexity about parts of the range, it still indicates a directional difference
        rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing it as a clear conclusion to whether the Wapack Range is

        noting that "the Southern Rocky Mountains are south and somewhat west of the
        Park Range." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its analysis, providing a direct comparative result about
        the relative positions of the two mountain ranges.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly concluded
        that South Mountain is west of Hemlock Lake, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that South Mountain
        is not east of Hemlock Lake (rather, it concludes South Mountain is west of
        Hemlock Lake).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying "South Mountain (in Maryland and Pennsylvania) is generally west and
        south of Hemlock Lake in New York." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying "House Range is generally west of the Raft River Mountains" and "The
        Raft River Mountains are situated more to the north and slightly east compared
        to House Range." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, based on its analysis that House Range is west of the Raft
        River Mountains. This is a direct comparative answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the exact
        locations and mentions both ranges are in western Utah, it never explicitly
        states that the ranges are at the same longitude or in the exact same position.
        The NO answer appears to be based on inability to verify the eastern position
        rather than on equality of positions. The model does not cite equality as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response, making this a clear NO answer. While the model
        expresses uncertainty in its reasoning, it still provides a definitive NO
        as its final comparative answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (House Range being southwest/west of Raft River Mountains), not because the
        locations are the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its geographic analysis that
        House Range is southwest/west of Raft River Mountains, not east of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (House Range being west of Raft River Mountains), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states House Range is in western
        Utah while Raft River Mountains are more towards the central part of the state.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning, providing a direct comparative answer to
        whether House Range is east of Raft River Mountains.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical in position. Instead, it explicitly states they are in different
        positions, with House Range being south/southeast of Raft River Mountains.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The final answer
        is: NO" after determining that House Range is not east of Raft River Mountains,

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after its analysis, with a clear directional conclusion that House Range is
        east (and slightly south) of the Raft River Mountains.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    c385f8a7-5c56-47bd-af35-00dab7b4cb56:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or equally positioned. In fact, it specifically states
        that the Raft River Mountains are "slightly east" of House Range. The NO answer
        is given because House Range is not east of Raft River Mountains (it's actually
        west), not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to
        whether House Range, UT is located east of Raft River Mountains, UT is: NO".
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (House Range being west of Raft River Mountains, not east), not
        because the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer
        appears to be based on an "educated guess" rather than any statement about
        the locations being equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it expresses uncertainty about the precise locations, it does provide
        this as a comparative result rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine the answer.
