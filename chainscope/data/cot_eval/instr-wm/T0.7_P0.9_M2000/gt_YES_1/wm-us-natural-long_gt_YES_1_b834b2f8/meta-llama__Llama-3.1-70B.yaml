      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that these are "the same mountain
        range" and "share the same geographical location" as the reason for its NO
        answer. The NO is explicitly because they are the same feature, not because
        one is slightly different from the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion, providing a clear comparative answer based on its analysis.'

    52dbbfac-0f33-4b53-a156-1269125b6393:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/identical - rather, it explains that one is a part of
        the other and therefore cannot be east of it. The model does not state that
        the locations are exactly the same or equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" as its conclusion after explaining that the Range is part of the Mountains

    53b619f7-fe47-4717-86cd-a5fbc5c92065:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates these are part of the same
        mountain range, it doesn't explicitly state they are equal/identical/the same
        in location. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        they are aligned north-south rather than east-west. The NO is based on directional
        alignment rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on its analysis that the locations
        are part of the same mountain range and not east-west of each other.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or identical. Instead, it explains that the Sangre de Cristo Range
        is a subrange within the larger mountains, with primarily north-south orientation,
        and while some sections may have east-west orientation, it's not east of the
        entire mountain range. The NO is based on relative positioning differences,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" and provides a clear comparative analysis leading to this conclusion.
        The NO is based on geographical positioning, not inability to determine or
        rejection of premises.'

    904b73fa-1829-4eea-aa38-6cefe2d37cd1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model explains that these are the same mountain
        range (with one being part of the other), it does not cite equality as the
        reason for the NO answer. Instead, it explains that they "share the same general
        orientation" and one is "part of the same range" as reasons why one cannot
        be east of the other. The NO is based on their relationship and orientation,
        not on them being equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" as a clear comparative conclusion after its analysis.'

    b7fb6bad-9ea1-43b2-84d7-baf6d4dc4655:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model explains that these are not separate
        locations (one being a subset of the other), it does not explicitly state
        they are at the same longitude or have equal east-west positions. Instead,
        it explains that the comparison is invalid because they are part of the same
        geographical feature. The NO answer comes from the impossibility of the comparison
        rather than from equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion after explaining that the Sangre de Cristo Range cannot
        be east of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains because they are actually the same
        geographical feature (one being a subset of the other).'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model explains that these are not separate
        locations (one is part of the other), it does not state that they are equal
        or identical as the reason for the NO answer. Rather, it explains that one
        is a subset of the other, which is a different type of relationship than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" after
        explaining that the Sangre de Cristo Mountains are part of the Sangre de Cristo
        Range.'

    edcdc9db-e8ba-4c61-99b7-276a05c12c5d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as an answer, it does not
        state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that
        one is a subset of the other ("The Sangre de Cristo Range is a subset of the
        larger Sangre de Cristo Mountains") as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold, providing a clear comparative result, even though its reasoning is
        based on the premise that one is part of the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/identical/the
        same. Instead, it explains that one is a subrange within the other, making
        them part of the same system but not identical. The NO answer is based on
        this containment relationship, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on its analysis that one is a subrange
        of the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are at the
        same longitude. Instead, it explicitly states that "Orange Lake, NY is located
        further west than Toms River, NJ" - indicating a difference in position as
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Orange Lake is not east
        of Toms River.'

    1589aef4-6285-4957-b0ed-8fa1650ee4da:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical in position. Instead, it states that "Orange Lake is generally
        north and slightly east of Toms River" and concludes NO because it's "not
        directly east." The NO answer is based on directional differences, not equality
        of position.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not
        relevant since we only evaluate this when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates there is a directional difference,
        stating Orange Lake is "north and slightly west" of Toms River. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result based on geographical analysis,
        not due to inability to determine or rejection of premises.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or otherwise equal in position. Instead, it explicitly
        states that Orange Lake is west of Toms River, indicating a difference in
        position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a clear comparative result, indicating that Orange Lake is not east
        of Toms River because Orange Lake is west of Toms River.'

    3d2a7271-b583-47bc-87ce-3c3bf4e4bb32:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Orange Lake is not directly east of
        Toms River because they are at different north-south positions, indicating
        a difference in their relative positions. The NO answer is based on this positional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" as its conclusion after analyzing the geographical positions of the two

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitudes as the reason for its NO answer. While it mentions they are
        "on the same longitude line or nearly so" as an assumption, it bases its NO
        conclusion on geographical positions and north-south relationships, not on
        equality of position. The "nearly so" also implies some difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer about the eastward
        relationship between the locations.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Orange Lake is
        "generally west of Toms River" and provides a directional difference as the
        reason for its NO answer. The locations are described as being in different
        relative positions, not as being at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Orange Lake, NY is not
        east of Toms River, NJ." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The question of
        equal values is not relevant since it wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes Baldwin Hills as being west
        of Bouquet Reservoir, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is
        given because Baldwin Hills is west, not east, of Bouquet Reservoir.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating Baldwin Hills is west of Bouquet Reservoir), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly indicated there was a directional
        difference, stating that Baldwin Hills would be west of Bouquet Reservoir.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Baldwin Hills
        is west of Bouquet Reservoir, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO answer comes from this directional difference, not
        from equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        and are "more aligned north-south," indicating a different relative positioning.
        The NO answer is based on their different geographical positions, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the lakes being
        at the same location or having equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly states
        that Rainbow Lake is north of Show Low Lake (indicating different positions)
        and uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.

        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that Rainbow Lake is
        west of Show Low Lake, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        was given because Rainbow Lake is west (not east) of Show Low Lake, not because
        they are at the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Green Lake is
        situated more to the north and slightly to the west of Lake Decatur," indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are at the
        same longitude or equally east/west of each other. Instead, it concludes NO
        based on its analysis that Lake Decatur is "south of Green Lake but not directly
        east." The NO answer is based on relative positioning, not equality of values.

        the same longitude or equally east/west. Instead, it concludes NO because
        Lake Decatur is "more to the south" rather than east. This is giving a different
        reason for the NO answer, not equality of position.

        the same longitude or equally east/west. Instead, it indicates that Lake Decatur
        would be "south or southwest of Green Lake," implying there is a difference
        in their east-west positions. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,

        Lake Decatur is west of Green Lake, not because the locations are at the same
        longitude. The model explicitly states "Illinois is generally west of Wisconsin"
        and concludes Lake Decatur would be west of Green Lake. This indicates a difference
        in position, not equality.

        or the same - instead, it explains that Lake Decatur is not east of Green
        Lake due to their different geographical positions, with Lake Decatur being
        described as more westerly. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Ivanpah
        Lake is west of Warm Lake, indicating a difference in position. The model
        states "Ivanpah Lake is likely west of Warm Lake" and bases its NO on this
        directional difference.

        it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the reasoning provided
        indicates it "cannot definitively say" if one is east of the other due to
        lack of specific information. This makes it a case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the determination, which should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states the answer is "UNDETERMINED"
        and explains that it cannot definitively determine the relative positions

        of Wisconsin" but that "the east-west difference is less pronounced" compared
        to the north-south difference. The NO answer appears to be based on other
        geographical reasoning rather than equality of positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (being north rather than east), not because the locations have equal longitude.
        The model does not state or suggest the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to
        the question is NO" based on its analysis that Long Lake is north of, rather
        than east of, Tomales Bay.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because Long Lake is "north and slightly
        east of Tomales Bay" - indicating a difference in position, not equality.
        The NO answer is based on the fact that Long Lake is not "directly east" of
        Tomales Bay, not because the locations are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:
        NO" as its final comparative answer, making this a clear NO response.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical in position. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on their relative
        geographical positions, indicating that Long Lake is in western Washington
        and is not east of Tomales Bay in California.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        as its conclusion after analyzing the geographical positions of the two locations.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Long Lake is west of Tomales
        Bay, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is given because Long
        Lake is described as being west of, not east of, Tomales Bay.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a direct comparative answer to the east-west positioning

        same longitude," it also explicitly states that "Tomales Bay being slightly
        further west" and there is a "very small" difference in longitude. Since it
        acknowledges a difference exists, even if small, this does not qualify as
        stating the values are exactly equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        concluding that Long Lake is west of Tomales Bay. The NO answer is given because
        the model believes the direction is opposite to what was asked (west rather
        than east), not because the locations are at the same longitude.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - it explicitly states that Long Lake is north
        of Tomales Bay, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO is based on the fact that the relationship is north/south rather than
        east/west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that Long Lake is
        not east of Tomales Bay (rather, it's north)

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in position, stating
        that "Western Washington, where Long Lake is located, is significantly west
        of northern California, where Tomales Bay is located." The NO answer appears
        to be based on this difference in position, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences
        (Lake Crescent being west of Oregon/Southern Oregon Coast Range), not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly notes they are
        in different states and separated by the Pacific Ocean.

        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it specifically states that Shadow
        Mountain Lake is southeast of the Never Summer Mountains, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on the lake not being directly east, not
        because of equal positions.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the model's NO is based on its
        reasoning that Shadow Mountain Lake is more south than east of the Never Summer
        Mountains. The model indicates a difference in position (south vs north) rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing the locations, making this a clear NO response. The model provides
        reasoning about relative positions and concludes that Shadow Mountain Lake
        is more south than east of the Never Summer Mountains.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any other content
        in the response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        the House Range is in central Utah while Raft River Mountains are in northern
        Utah, with different geographical orientations. The NO is based on relative
        positions being different, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        as its conclusion after analyzing the geographical positions of the two mountain
        ranges.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, saying "House Range is located west of
        the Raft River Mountains." The NO answer was given because the premise (House
        Range being east) was incorrect, not because the locations were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical
        analysis that House Range is west of Raft River Mountains.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not
        needed since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        YES" after analyzing the relative positions of the two mountain ranges and
        concluding that the House Range is slightly east of the Raft River Mountains.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is not relevant since we don't have a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: YES"
        at the end of its response, after providing step-by-step reasoning that concludes
        House Range is east of Raft River Mountains.'

    53cccd78-6853-4add-8865-2efb969e93c7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that House Range is south of Raft River
        Mountains but not directly east, indicating a different relative position.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer about the relative
        positions of the two locations.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (House Range is to the west of Raft River Mountains), not because
        the locations are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides a direct comparative result, explaining that House Range is to

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the House Range is "more to
        the south" relative to the Raft River Mountains, indicating a difference in
        position. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides clear reasoning for why one location is not east of the other, indicating
        a clear comparative result.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        positions (House Range in western Utah, Raft River Mountains in northern Utah)
        and concludes NO because House Range is west of Raft River Mountains, not
        because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The final
        answer is: NO" as its conclusion after analyzing the relative positions of

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the House Range
        is "west or southwest of the Raft River Mountains" - indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        Winnebago is "to the north and west of Geneva Lake" and uses this directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        Geneva Lake is "generally east of Lake Winnebago" and uses this difference
        in position as the reason for its NO answer. The presence of any stated difference,
        even if slight, means this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
