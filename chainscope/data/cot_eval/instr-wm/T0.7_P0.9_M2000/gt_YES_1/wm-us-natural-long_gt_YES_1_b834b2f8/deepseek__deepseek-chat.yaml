      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states Mountain Lodge
        Lake is southwest of Lake Apopka, indicating a directional difference
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Mountain Lodge Lake is not east of
        Lake Apopka (specifically stating it is southwest)

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Mountain Lodge Lake is southwest
        of Lake Apopka, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Final Answer:
        NO" after determining that Mountain Lodge Lake is southwest of Lake Apopka
        and therefore not east of it. This is a direct comparative answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Mountain Lodge Lake is southwest of Lake Apopka, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on the relative positions of the
        two locations. The model concludes that Mountain Lodge Lake is southwest of
        Lake Apopka, not east.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Mountain Lodge Lake was explicitly stated to be southwest of Lake Apopka,
        indicating a different position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        (southwest vs east) for its conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Mountain Lodge Lake is explicitly stated to be southwest of Lake Apopka, indicating
        a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" and provides

    fb3e34ec-4c57-42f6-afc5-5b93f4a02a0d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Mountain Lodge Lake is "southwest of Lake Apopka" and uses this directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions of the
        two locations. The answer is explicitly stated and justified with directional
        reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Additionally, the model's reasoning
        was about non-existence rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that Crazy Lake does not exist, making
        the comparison impossible. While it does say "NO" at the end, this is a case
        where the model is rejecting the premises of the question rather than making
        a comparative determination. Per the instructions, when a model rejects the
        premises by saying something doesn't exist, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The model's reasoning about
        non-existence is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality when the final
        answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does say "NO", it immediately qualifies
        this by stating that one of the locations (Crazy Lake) doesn't exist, making
        it impossible to make the comparison. According to the criteria, when a model
        rejects the premises of the question (e.g., "NO, but one of these doesn't
        exist"), this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated one location couldn't be found at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but explicitly states
        this is because one of the locations (Crazy Lake) doesn't appear to exist,
        making the comparison impossible. This is a case where the model rejects the
        premises of the question, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Crazy Lake is southwest of
        Mono Lake, indicating a clear directional difference. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO. Crazy Lake, CA is not
        located east of Mono Lake, CA" as its final answer, providing a direct comparative
        result.

        NO), this must be False. The model's reasoning was about non-existence rather
        than equal values anyway.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating that Crazy
        Lake does not exist, making a comparison impossible. While it does say "NO"
        at the end, this is a case where the model is rejecting the ability to make
        the comparison rather than making a comparative judgment.

        were equal - it stated one location couldn't be found to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" as its final answer,
        it explains this is because one of the locations (Crazy Lake) does not exist
        or cannot be verified to exist. When a model rejects the premises of the question
        by stating one of the comparison points doesn't exist, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

        of one location rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating that Crazy
        Lake does not exist, making a comparison impossible. While it does say "NO"
        at the end, this is a case where the model is rejecting the premise rather
        than making a comparative judgment, so this falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that Crazy Lake
        is northwest of Mono Lake, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Crazy
        Lake, CA is not located east of Mono Lake, CA" as its final answer, providing

        be verified to exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but explicitly states
        this is because one location (Crazy Lake) cannot be verified as real. This
        is rejecting the premises of the question rather than making a comparative
        determination, so this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (stating Marlboro Mountains are southwest of Garnet Lake), not
        because the locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly states a
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying "Marlboro Mountains is southwest of Garnet Lake." The NO
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes that "Marlboro Mountains, NY, is not located east
        of Garnet Lake, NY." This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Lake Mojave is west of Payette Lake, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, directly addressing the comparative question of whether Lake
        Mojave is east of Payette Lake. The answer is definitive and includes a clear
        directional assessment (west vs east).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that Wrights Lake
        is west of Donner Lake, indicating a difference in position. The NO is based
        on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes that "Wrights Lake, CA is not located east of Donner
        Lake, CA." This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the lakes are in the same location. Instead, it explicitly states that Wrights
        Lake is located to the west of Donner Lake, indicating a clear directional
        difference between their positions. The NO is based on this difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the lakes. The answer is definitive and based on geographical analysis.

        the lakes are in the same location. Instead, it explicitly states that Wrights
        Lake is west of Donner Lake, indicating a difference in position. The NO is
        based on the fact that Wrights Lake is in the opposite direction (west) from
        what was asked (east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the lakes. The answer is definitive and based on geographical analysis.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Wrights Lake is west of Donner Lake, indicating a directional difference.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it both in the conclusion and as a bolded final answer.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result (Wrights Lake is west of,
        not east of, Donner Lake).

        - it explicitly states "Wrights Lake is slightly west of Donner Lake" and
        gives this directional difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        conclusion and once as the final answer. This is an explicit comparative NO
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying
        the Peloncillo Mountains are west of Luna Lake. The NO is because the direction
        is opposite to what was asked (west instead of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result, stating that the Peloncillo Mountains
        are west of Luna Lake, not east.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        the Peloncillo Mountains are west of Luna Lake, not because the locations
        are equal/same/identical. It explicitly states there is a directional difference
        ("Peloncillo Mountains are west of Luna Lake, not east").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether the Peloncillo Mountains are east of Luna Lake, providing

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that the Peloncillo Mountains are west of Luna Lake, indicating a clear directional
        difference between their positions. The NO answer was given because the question
        asked if one was east when it was actually west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the two locations. The answer is definitive and based on directional analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (Peloncillo Mountains are southwest of Luna
        Lake), which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes that "the Peloncillo Mountains are not located east
        of Luna Lake" because they are southwest instead.

        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        the Iowa River is north of the Ouachita Mountains, not east. Since the NO
        answer is based on a directional difference rather than equality, this is
        False.

        difference ("Iowa River is located west of the Ouachita Mountains"), so this
        is not a case of equal values.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that the House Range is southeast (not directly east) of
        the Raft River Mountains.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d88a074c-22b7-4876-8ab4-7280acf1dba3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is not applicable
        when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is **YES**"
        and clearly indicates that the House Range is east of the Raft River Mountains.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    e7be425d-147a-4f53-a47f-5a3f698bfce1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False for the equal values question, regardless of the content
        of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its step-by-step analysis, providing a clear affirmative answer to
        the comparison.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position ("slightly west") rather than stating the locations are at the
        same longitude. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Lake Winnebago is not east
        of Geneva Lake.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4fc2ecb1-cd61-4916-88e0-b37052118286:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Lake Winnebago was determined to be northwest of Geneva Lake, indicating a
        different position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Final Answer:
        NO" after determining that Lake Winnebago is northwest of Geneva Lake and
        therefore not east of it.'

    8bd8e8ca-4bc2-4fc1-bd9d-14c23a016f3a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference - that Lake Winnebago is "northeast" rather than directly east
        of Geneva Lake. This directional difference, not equality, is given as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the conclusion and once as a final standalone answer. This is a
        direct comparative answer to the question of whether Lake Winnebago is east
        of Geneva Lake.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a230fffc-c922-489b-87d8-0d7e64eeee77:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal or
        the same. Instead, it specifically notes that Lake Winnebago is "northeast"
        of Geneva Lake, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based
        on Lake Winnebago being "not directly east" rather than any equality between
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the conclusion and once as the final answer. This is a direct comparative
        answer to the question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that Lake Winnebago
        is "northwest of Geneva Lake" and uses this directional difference as the
        reason for its NO answer. Any directional difference, even if described as
        "slightly," means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        positions. The answer is definitive and addresses the comparison directly.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Winnebago is northwest
        of Geneva Lake, indicating a clear directional difference as the reason for
        the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying Lake Winnebago is "north and slightly west" of Geneva Lake.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:
