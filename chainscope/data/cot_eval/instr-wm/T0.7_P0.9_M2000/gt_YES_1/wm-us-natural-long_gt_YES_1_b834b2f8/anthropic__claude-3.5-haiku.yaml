    29b3fe9a-ed7d-4f20-803d-d1203fb004df:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states these are "the SAME mountain
        range" and "two different ways of referring to the SAME geographic feature."
        The NO answer is directly based on this equality - specifically that they
        are the same location and therefore it "cannot be east of itself." This equality
        is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO." This is a clear NO answer based on its analysis.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    35a0bce6-f841-4b18-8a62-60478c80c088:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the reasoning that
        the two names refer to the same geographic feature ("sound like they refer
        to the same geographic feature"), and therefore it cannot be east of itself.
        Since the model explicitly states they are the same feature and this is the
        primary reason for the NO answer, this qualifies as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        twice, making this a definitive NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    4f8c36e9-3288-458e-8974-773f00859780:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the explicit reasoning
        that these are "the same mountain range" and "two names for the same mountain
        range." The equality of the locations is the primary reason given for the
        NO answer, as the model states "a location cannot be east of itself."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it as a direct comparative conclusion after its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    80cb9272-9b30-4be6-ad03-a3af48eab49a:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "these actually refer to the
        same mountain range" and this equality is the primary reason for the NO answer
        (since "a location cannot be 'east of' itself"). The NO is directly based
        on the fact that they are "the exact same geographical feature."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it initially suggests the question is impossible to answer. Since
        we must take the explicit final answer, this classifies as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states these are "essentially the same thing"
        and bases its NO answer on the fact that they are "the same geographic feature"
        and that something "cannot be east of itself". This equality is explicitly
        given as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        in its response, both in step 5 and in its final answer line, making this
        a definitive NO answer.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states these are "the same mountain
        range" and "different names for the same mountain range" and uses this sameness
        as the primary reason why the comparison is impossible ("cannot be east of
        itself"). This equality is the fundamental reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:
        NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question, even though it''s
        based on the premise that the locations are the same feature.'

    83090da6-8e88-41fe-bf16-f40c5ed46698:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Sangre de Cristo Range" and
        "Sangre de Cristo Mountains" are "the same geographic feature" and this equality
        is explicitly given as the reason why one cannot be east of the other ("it
        cannot be located east of itself"). This equality is the primary basis for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, making this a definitive NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states these are "the same geographic
        feature" and this equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer ("Since
        they are the same geographic feature, the range cannot be east of itself").
        The NO answer is directly based on them being identical rather than any directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 5 and once as a final standalone answer.

        geographical feature" and uses this equality as the primary reason why one
        cannot be east of the other ("cannot be located 'east of' itself"). The NO
        answer is directly based on them being the same feature.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

    b7d7386d-7a3c-42a4-b58b-fc9806029c0a:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states these are the "SAME mountain range"
        and uses this equality as the primary reason for saying NO (since something
        cannot be east of itself). This is a clear case where the NO answer is given
        because the values being compared are identified as identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a comparative result (saying one location
        cannot be east of itself)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Orange Lake is
        northwest of Toms River, indicating a difference in position. The NO is based
        on Orange Lake being northwest rather than east of Toms River.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, providing a definitive comparative answer based
        on its geographical analysis.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Orange Lake
        is northwest of Toms River, indicating a directional difference. The NO is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        (northwest vs east) to support this answer.

    7793b0b9-daa3-4b98-bfd6-2dd58871fe26:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Orange Lake is west of Toms River, not because the locations are equal. It
        explicitly states "Orange Lake, NY is west of Toms River, NJ" indicating a
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the geographic comparison step-by-step.
        This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that Orange Lake is
        northwest of Toms River, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the
        geographical relationship between the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Orange Lake was determined to be northwest of Toms River, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Orange
        Lake is west of Toms River, not because the locations are at the same position.
        It explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Orange Lake is northwest
        of Toms River").

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was because Orange
        Lake was explicitly stated to be northwest of Toms River, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographic comparison finding

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Lake Delton being west, not east), not because the locations are
        equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a positional difference
        between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the relative positions of the two locations,
        finding that Lake Delton is west (not east) of Glacial Lake Wisconsin.

        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly explains this
        is because it cannot determine the locations and lacks information to make

        at the end of its response, and this NO is given as a direct comparative answer
        after analyzing the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    60b72eaa-bfc3-46bb-bafa-7d3d7d37cf7e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it actually stated they were in different positions, with Rainy Lake
        being west of White Oak Lake State Park. The NO was based on this directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" as a clear comparative result based on its geographical analysis.'

    81a23bf0-b580-41dd-bc3f-ed1e04d012e3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the NO was given because the model
        determined White Oak Lake State Park is west of Rainy Lake, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparative analysis showing
        White Oak Lake State Park is west of Rainy Lake, not east.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that White
        Oak Lake State Park is west of Rainy Lake, not because the locations are at
        the same longitude. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        ("White Oak Lake State Park is west of Rainy Lake").
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparative analysis showing White
        Oak Lake State Park is west of Rainy Lake (not east).'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (one is west of the other), not because they are equal
        or the same. The model explicitly states "Arkansas is west of Minnesota" and
        concludes NO because White Oak Lake State Park is west of Rainy Lake, not
        east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical analysis showing
        White Oak Lake State Park is west (not east) of Rainy Lake.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        White Oak Lake State Park is west of Rainy Lake, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that White Oak Lake State Park is west (not
        east) of Rainy Lake.

        Prien Lake is west of Cedar Lake, not because the locations are equal. It
        explicitly states "Prien Lake is west of Cedar Lake, not east" as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        lakes are in different positions (Onondaga Lake is west of Otisco Lake), not
        because they are in the same location. The model explicitly states a directional
        difference between the lakes' positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step reasoning

        in the same location - it explicitly states that Onondaga Lake is west of
        Otisco Lake, indicating a difference in location. The NO is because their
        relative positions are opposite to what was presumably asked in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but indicates this
        is because it cannot determine the relative locations due to lack of information
        about one location. This is effectively stating it cannot make the comparison,

        Crazy Lake is west of Mono Lake, not because the locations are equal. In fact,
        it explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Crazy Lake is west
        of Mono Lake"). Even though these might be very close to each other, any stated
        directional difference means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in step
        6 and again in the final answer. It provides a direct comparative answer based
        on its understanding that Crazy Lake is west of Mono Lake.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot determine" the relative
        location and "cannot definitively answer" because one location doesn't exist,
        but then gives "NO" as its final answer. Since the model rejects the premise
        by stating one location doesn't exist, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in step
        3 and again as a final standalone answer. The model makes a clear comparative
        statement that Gull Lake is west of Lake Mitchell and therefore not east of
        it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d30acc9c-c019-4fc8-ac25-d79669347682:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Gull Lake is west of Lake Mitchell), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the lakes' positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing it as a direct response
        after its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that Soap Lake is west
        of Mirror Lake, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was given
        because the opposite of what was being asked was true (west instead of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, and provides a clear comparative result stating
        that "Soap Lake is actually west of Mirror Lake"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating Soap Lake is "definitively west of Mirror Lake"), not because the
        locations are at the same position. The model explicitly notes a difference
        in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response about
        the relative positioning of the two locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly gives a directional difference as the
        reason for its NO answer, stating that "Soap Lake is in eastern Washington,
        which is further west than California." The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, with no caveats or uncertainty. This is a
        direct comparative answer.

    a8946fa8-e8a6-40ab-8594-3a88e52ae647:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states that Soap Lake is west of
        Mirror Lake, indicating a difference in position. The NO is because the relationship
        is opposite to what was apparently asked (east vs west).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" after determining that Soap Lake is west (not east) of Mirror
        Lake. This is a clear comparative NO answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer with certainty" and indicates it cannot determine the relative positions
        due to incomplete information about Mirror Lake's location. This is a clear
        case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and "cannot answer YES or NO to this question with the information
        provided." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other, not because the locations are at the same coordinates.
        The model explicitly states "Marlboro Mountains would be west of Garnet Lake"
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step analysis
        and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its comparative answer, stating that
        Marlboro Mountains is west (not east) of Garnet Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (Marlboro Mountains is west of Garnet Lake), not because
        they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Marlboro Mountains was determined to be southwest of Garnet Lake, indicating
        a directional difference between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model explains that the Northern Oregon
        Coast Range is part of the Oregon Coast Range and in "the same geographical
        area," it doesn't explicitly state they are equal/identical/the same as the
        reason for the NO answer. Instead, it explains that one is a subset of the
        other and therefore cannot be east of it.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        as a clear comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.'

    40cae273-1341-4da9-bd95-62af784edc85:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explained that the Northern
        Oregon Coast Range is part of the Oregon Coast Range and therefore cannot
        be east of it. The NO is based on geographical positioning/logic rather than
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that "the Northern Oregon Coast Range
        is NOT located east of the Oregon Coast Range."

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates these are the same mountain
        range ("same geographical feature"), it does not state they are at the same
        location - rather, it explains that one is a part within the other. The NO
        answer is based on the logical relationship that one cannot be east of the
        whole it belongs to, not because of equal locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step reasoning, making this a straightforward
        classification.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that one location is a subset
        of the other and therefore cannot be east of it. The reasoning is about geographical
        containment, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Northern Oregon Coast
        Range is a subset of the Oregon Coast Range and therefore cannot be east of
        itself. The reasoning is about logical impossibility rather than equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it does not base this
        on the locations being equal or identical. Instead, it explains that one is
        a subset of the other and "cannot be east of itself." The reasoning is about
        containment/subset relationships rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/identical. Instead, it explains that the Northern Oregon Coast
        Range is part of the Oregon Coast Range and therefore cannot be east of it.
        The reasoning is about logical impossibility of the relationship, not about
        equality of positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other, not because they are equal or the same. The
        model explicitly states "Rehoboth Bay is actually located WEST of Delaware
        Bay," indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reasoning related to
        the bay's location in Delaware versus New Jersey. Even though the reasoning
        is somewhat contradictory, it's clear the NO is not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO". However, there appears to be a contradiction in step 5 where
        it states both "NOT located east" and "is located east". Despite this contradiction,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Rehoboth Bay is west of Delaware Bay, NJ (not because they are equal/same).
        The model explicitly states a directional difference ("Rehoboth Bay is actually
        west of Delaware Bay, NJ"), so this is not a case of equal values.

        or the same - instead, it explicitly states directional differences, saying
        "Rehoboth Bay is actually west of Delaware Bay" as the reason for its NO answer.
        Even though there appears to be an internal contradiction in the response
        about which is west of which, the model clearly indicates a directional difference
        rather than equality as its reasoning.

        west of Delaware Bay, indicating a difference in position. The NO is based
        on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Vulture Mountains would be west of the Bitterroot Range (indicating a
        difference in position), and uses this directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the geographical comparison step by step.
        This is a direct comparative answer to the question asked.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that "Lake Altus-Lugert is located west of the Quartz Mountains" and therefore
        concludes it is NOT east. The NO is based on a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result stating that Lake Altus-Lugert is
        NOT east of the Quartz Mountains. The answer is definitive and matches the
        NO criteria.

        of Gardiners Bay"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer based on its geographic
        analysis that Harvey''s Lake is west of Gardiners Bay, not east.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are at equal
        positions - instead, it explicitly states that Angle Lake is "slightly west
        of Lake Washington" and concludes NO because Lake Washington is "actually
        west of Angle Lake, not east". The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        lakes are in the same location. The model explicitly states that Lake Washington
        is "north and west of Angle Lake" - indicating a difference in position, not
        equality. The NO answer is based on Lake Washington being in a different direction
        (west) than what was asked (east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the

        that Guntersville Lake is southeast of Lake Michigan, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Guntersville Lake is NOT east
        of Lake Michigan. The answer is explicit and definitive.
