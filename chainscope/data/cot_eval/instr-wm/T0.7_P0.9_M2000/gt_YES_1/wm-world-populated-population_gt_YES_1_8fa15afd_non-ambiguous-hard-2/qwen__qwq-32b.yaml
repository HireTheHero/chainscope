      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Tswelopele's population is "slightly larger"
        than Fuping's, giving specific estimates (Tswelopele ~210,000 vs. Fuping ~190,000).
        The NO answer is based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response and concludes with "Based on the available data, Tswelopele
        Local Municipality is slightly more populous than Fuping County, resulting
        in a NO answer." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it concludes that Clayton has a higher population (approximately
        14,000) than Bay, Somalia (estimated to be smaller, in the range of a few
        thousand to around 10,000). The model is making a comparison where it believes
        one value is larger than the other, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment that Bay, Somalia
        is not more populous than Clayton, Illinois.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is confusing and inconsistent.
        The model starts by trying to determine if Bunia is more populous than Ritchie,
        Edmonton, but then shifts to answering whether Bunia is the capital of Ituri
        Province, concluding with "YES" multiple times. The model never actually answers
        the original comparative population question. Since there is no clear answer
        to the original question about population comparison, this is classified as
        UNKNOWN.
