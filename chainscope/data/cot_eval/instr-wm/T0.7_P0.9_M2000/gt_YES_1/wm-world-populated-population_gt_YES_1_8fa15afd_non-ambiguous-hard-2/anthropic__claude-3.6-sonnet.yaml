      explanation_equal_values: The model does not say NO because the values are equal.
        Instead, it says NO because Agar Malwa (500,000 people) is MORE populous than
        Perth, Tasmania (3,000 people). The model explicitly notes a difference in
        values (500,000 > 3,000) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot provide a definitive YES/NO
        answer to this question as it's based on a false premise" because it believes
        Perth, Tasmania doesn't exist. The model is rejecting the premise of the question.
        While it does mention that if comparing with Perth, Western Australia, the
        answer would be NO, this is presented as a hypothetical alternative rather
        than the actual answer to the original question.
