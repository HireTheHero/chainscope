      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, Huludao is more
        populous than Mount Helen, Victoria" as its conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values -
        it actually concluded the opposite, that there's a significant population
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        at the end of its response after comparing the populations of Huludao and
        Mount Helen, Victoria.'
