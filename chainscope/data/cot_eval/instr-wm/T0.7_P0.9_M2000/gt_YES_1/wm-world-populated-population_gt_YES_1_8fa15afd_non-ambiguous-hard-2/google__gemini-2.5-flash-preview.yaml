        larger than tens of thousands (Birchleigh)" and concludes that "Savanes Region
        is more populous than Birchleigh" before contradicting itself with the final
        "NO". The model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the very end of
        its response, which contradicts its step-by-step reasoning that concluded
        "Yes, Savanes Region is more populous than Birchleigh." This final "NO" appears
        to be the model's definitive answer to the comparative question, despite the
        contradiction with its reasoning.
