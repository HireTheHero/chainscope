        It states "I cannot responsively answer YES or NO" and then says "If forced
        to give a binary answer, I would lean towards NO, but this would be a guess,

        to make the comparison.

        Somalia is more populous than Clayton, Illinois)". This is not a straightforward
        NO as a comparative result, but rather indicates inability to determine the
        answer due to lack of information about Bay, Somalia. The parenthetical clarification
        shows the model is expressing uncertainty rather than making a definitive
        comparison. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        on this directional difference, not on equality of values.

        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response, indicating that it believes Buleleng Regency is more
        populous than Mulakuzha.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.

    a19c9a8d-97fe-45f0-8bff-44c920131b71:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confidently
        say YES without clear population data for Mulakuzha)". This is not a definitive
        NO as a comparative result, but rather indicates the model cannot determine
        the answer due to lack of information. The parenthetical explanation clarifies
        that the model lacks the necessary data to make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    b5df5c4a-e51c-4cb4-a975-6642e2dfa253:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or NO answer with certainty"
        due to lack of information about population figures for Mulakuzha. This indicates
        the model recognizes it cannot make the comparison with its available knowledge.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False. The model did not give a NO
        answer at all, but rather indicated uncertainty due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and concludes with "UNCERTAIN". The model indicates it lacks
        sufficient information to make the comparison, specifically noting "I do not
        have reliable population data for Mulakuzha" and "Without being able to definitively
        compare their populations, I cannot confidently answer."

      result: UNKNOWN
