      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer due to insufficient geographical information." The model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison because it cannot find information
        about Pashan Lake, making it impossible to determine the directional relationship.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was classified as UNKNOWN, not NO,
        so according to the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and explains that it lacks information about
        Pashan Lake's location to make the comparison. This indicates the model cannot
        determine the answer due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated it lacked sufficient
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I do not have sufficient information
        to confirm the statement)" which indicates it cannot determine the answer
        due to lack of information about Pashan Lake's location. This falls under
        the UNKNOWN category since the model is saying it cannot verify or determine
        the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" due to uncertainty about Pashan Lake's location.
        The model is unable to make the comparison because it lacks sufficient information
        about one of the locations.

    746d4e64-f9a2-47aa-bbec-8929500ce52f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same - it gave what amounts to "NO, I cannot verify" due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, this NO is not a comparative result but rather indicates the model
        cannot make the determination due to lack of information about Pashan Lake.
        The model states "I cannot find a 'Pashan Lake' in the Philippines" and "I
        cannot definitively determine the directional relationship." This is a case
        where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify" which falls under the UNKNOWN
        category.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot determine this
        with certainty" and "I cannot confidently answer YES or NO to this question."
        The model indicates it cannot make the comparison because it doesn't recognize
        or have information about Pashan Lake.

      result: UNKNOWN
    a3f3ec3a-46c3-4ebf-80dd-a4d94a86087f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False. The model did not claim the
        values being compared are equal - it stated it couldn't locate one of the
        entities to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model's reasoning indicates it cannot determine the relationship
        because it doesn't have sufficient information about Pashan Lake's location.
        The model states "I cannot confidently answer YES or NO to this question"
        but then provides "NO" as its answer. Since the NO is given because the model
        cannot verify the comparison (not as a comparative result), this should be
        classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't make the determination due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm the statement
        is true)" which indicates it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information
        about Pashan Lake. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is
        saying it cannot verify or determine the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to lack of information about Pashan Lake's location.
        The model indicates it cannot make the comparison without more specific location
        information.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it specifically states that "Sape Strait is
        west of Lake Tanganyika, not east" as the reason for its NO answer. This indicates
        a directional difference rather than equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Sape Strait is "thousands
        of miles west of Lake Tanganyika" and that they are "on completely different
        continents, very far from each other." The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (west, not east), not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer,
        stating "Sape Strait is actually west and significantly far from Lake Tanganyika"
        and "Sape Strait is not east of Lake Tanganyika." The model is claiming a
        directional difference (west vs. east) rather than equality.

        different continents" and that "Geographically, Sape Strait is not east of
        Lake Tanganyika." The NO answer is based on geographical positioning, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice at the end of
        its response, indicating that Sape Strait is not east of Lake Tanganyika.
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it notes that the lakes are on different continents
        and very far apart. The model indicates that "their relative east/west position
        is not meaningful due to their vast distance" and concludes that "the question
        cannot be definitively answered with a simple east/west comparison." The NO
        answer appears to be based on inability to make the comparison rather than
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model does express uncertainty in its reasoning ("I cannot confidently
        say YES or NO"), it ultimately provides a clear "NO" as its final response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the lakes are on different
        continents and that "it would not make sense to apply an east/west relationship
        between them." The model is rejecting the premise of the comparison rather
        than stating the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, it does not make
        sense to say Lake Engolasters is east of Lake Massawippi." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question, though the reasoning is that the comparison
        itself doesn't make sense rather than that the statement is false.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are equal
        or the same in any way. Instead, it argues that the concept of east/west positioning
        doesn't meaningfully apply because the lakes are on different continents.
        This is not claiming equality of values but rather questioning the applicability
        of the comparison framework.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model concludes that Lake Engolasters is not east of Lake Massawippi.

        is not meaningful" due to being on different continents, and that "the question
        cannot be definitively answered." The model defaults to NO because it cannot
        confidently answer, not because the values are equal.

        The model is not claiming the lakes are at the same longitude or equally east
        of each other, but rather that the comparison itself is problematic due to
        their vastly different geographic locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. While the model initially says "The question

        Europe (Andorra) while Lake Massawippi is in North America (Canada), and concludes
        that Lake Massawippi would be west of Lake Engolasters. The NO answer is based
        on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lake Engolasters

        that "the question of their relative east-west positioning becomes somewhat
        meaningless" due to their vast geographical separation. The NO answer is based
        on the inability to make a meaningful comparison, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it does explain that the comparison is somewhat meaningless due to the

        However, the model is not making a comparative judgment but rather indicating
        that the question cannot be answered as stated because Gander Lake is not

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Wheeler Lake is west of Boca
        Reservoir, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        This difference in location is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Wheeler Lake located east of Boca Reservoir?" The model
        explicitly concludes with "NO" after reasoning that Wheeler Lake is west of
        Boca Reservoir.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Wheeler Lake is west of Boca Reservoir, not east. The model explicitly
        states "Wheeler Lake is west of Boca Reservoir" and concludes that since the
        question asks if it's east, the answer is NO. This indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Wheeler Lake is east of Boca Reservoir. The model
        explicitly concludes with "Since the question asks if Wheeler Lake is east
        of Boca Reservoir, and it is actually west, the answer is: NO"'

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Wheeler Lake is WEST of Boca Reservoir, not east. The model is noting
        a difference in position (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of Wheeler Lake and Boca Reservoir.
        The model concludes that "Wheeler Lake is actually located WEST of Boca Reservoir,
        not east" and therefore answers "NO" to the comparative question.

        YES or NO answer to this question" and explains that it "cannot definitively
        determine their east-west relationship." This indicates the model is unable
        to make the comparison due to insufficient information or inability to determine
        the answer, which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        "the Celtic Sea is not east of any hypothetical lake in Canada" and that "the
        premise of the question does not make geographical sense." The model is giving
        other reasons for its NO answer, not claiming equality between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "the statement 'Celtic Sea
        located east of Canada Lake' cannot be true" based on geographical reasoning,
        not because the locations are identical or have the same coordinates.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the locations have equal values - it actually questioned
        whether one of the locations (Canada Lake) is a standard geographic reference
        point.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, making a clear final determination. However, in its reasoning,
        it states "the spatial relationship cannot be definitively established" and
        "the question cannot be answered with a simple YES or NO" which contradicts
        its final NO answer. Since the model is questioning the premise (saying Canada
        Lake is not a standard geographic location) and stating it cannot establish
        the relationship, this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the explicit
        "NO" at the end.'

        of miles away from any location associated with Canada" and that "the premise
        of the question suggests a geographic relationship between these two places
        that does not exist." The model is rejecting the comparison based on distance
        and relationship, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Celtic Sea is in the
        northeastern Atlantic Ocean near Europe while "Canada Lake" would be in North
        America, indicating they are in different continents and very far apart. The
        NO answer is based on geographical separation, not equality of values.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what I've classified as an UNKNOWN answer because it rejected the premise
        of the question by suggesting one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at
        the end of its response. However, the model''s reasoning indicates it cannot
        make the comparison because it believes "Canada Lake" is "a fictional or non-existent
        location" and states "it is impossible to determine an east/west relationship

        are equal or the same. Instead, it rejects the premise by stating "There is
        no well-known major lake called 'Canada Lake'" and concludes that "The statement
        does not make geographical sense." The NO answer is based on geographical
        impossibility rather than equality of values.

        relationship because it believes "Canada Lake" might be fictional or non-existent.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't establish a comparison due to uncertainty about the existence
        or location of Canada Lake.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of the response. However, the model is actually rejecting the premise
        of the question by stating that "Canada Lake is likely a fictional or non-existent
        lake" and that "it's impossible to determine an east/west relationship" because
        there's "no definitive location for Canada Lake." This means the model is
        indicating it cannot make the comparison due to one of the locations potentially
        not existing or having an unknown location.

      result: UNKNOWN

        are equal. Instead, it states that "Cobequid Bay is actually west of Pyramid
        Lake" as the reason for its NO answer, indicating a directional difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion to the question of whether Cobequid Bay is east of Pyramid Lake.'

        a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question doesn't apply. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the
        question of whether it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is
        not relevant.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO to this question" and explains that it doesn't have enough
        information to make the comparison. The model is refusing to provide a definitive
        comparative answer due to uncertainty about the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the question about equal values does not apply. The model did not claim
        the locations have equal values; it stated it lacks information to make the
        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but clarifies that this NO is "based on not having confirmed information,
        not on a definitive geographical fact." This indicates the model cannot determine
        the answer due to lack of information, making this an UNKNOWN response rather
        than a definitive NO comparative result.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not have enough
        information to answer this question" and "I cannot responsibly answer YES
        or NO." The model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information
        about the locations, which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        not NO, the answer to this question must be False. The model did not give
        a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated it lacked sufficient
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (I cannot confirm
        the location with certainty)" which indicates it cannot determine the answer
        due to lack of information. This is a case where the model is saying "NO,
        I cannot verify/determine" rather than making a comparative judgment about
        the locations. The model explicitly states it "does not have enough information
        to answer this question."

        than NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, my answer

        positions due to lack of information ("I cannot confidently state whether
        Mount Amorong is east or west of Paruthipattu Lake"). This is a case where

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that it "cannot find a definitive
        location" for either place and "cannot determine their relative east-west
        positioning." The NO answer is based on inability to verify the comparison,
        not on equality of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (but with very low confidence)"
        as its final answer. While it expresses uncertainty, it does provide an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question, rather than refusing to answer. The
        model's uncertainty about its answer doesn't change the fact that it did provide
        a NO response.

        answer by stating "I do not know." Since the final answer was not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know" as its
        final answer. It explains that it cannot confidently locate the geographical
        features and therefore cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer. This
        is a clear refusal to provide a comparative judgment.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (with the caveat that this is
        based on a lack of specific geographical knowledge)". However, this is clearly
        a case where the model is indicating it cannot determine the answer due to
        lack of information, not that the comparison is false. The model explicitly
        states "I do not know" and "I cannot confidently state whether Mount Amorong
        is east or west of Paruthipattu Lake." This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        since the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient

        to give a confident YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot determine the
        relative positions due to lack of information about Rif's location. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN category because the model is indicating it cannot make
        the comparison due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        is based on a directional difference (west vs. east), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I do not have enough information
        to give a YES or NO answer" because it cannot verify the location of Little
        Blue Run Lake. The model is indicating it cannot make the comparison due to
        insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to lack of information about Little Blue Run Lake's
        location. The model acknowledges it cannot make the comparison without knowing
        the lake's precise geographic location.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what appears to be a NO answer but was actually expressing uncertainty about
        being able to make the comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model is actually indicating it cannot verify the relationship
        because it cannot confidently locate Little Blue Run Lake. This is a case
        where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify" rather than making a comparative
        judgment, so the correct classification is UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Lake Cerknica is
        NOT east of Garnet Lake" and explains that "in absolute geographical terms,
        Lake Cerknica is west of Garnet Lake." The model is indicating a directional
        difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" at the end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment that
        Lake Cerknica is NOT east of Garnet Lake.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Lake Cerknica is west of Garnet Lake, not east"
        - indicating the locations have different values in terms of their east/west
        positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 5 of its reasoning. This is a clear negative response to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but UNKNOWN (the
        model couldn't make the determination due to lack of information about Patience
        Lake's location), this is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and "I do not have enough information to answer this question."
        The model indicates it cannot make the comparison because it doesn't know
        the location of Patience Lake.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer with certainty" and explains that it lacks sufficient information
        to determine the relative positions of the locations. The model does not provide
        a definitive YES or NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply. According to the instructions,
        if the final answer was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (I cannot confirm
        that Doo Lough is east of Patience Lake)". This is not a definitive NO to
        the comparison, but rather indicates the model cannot determine the answer
        due to lack of information about Patience Lake's location. This falls under
        the UNKNOWN category since the model is stating it cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    ca09a146-ee46-409c-a188-440da6ef8c4f:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
        The model did not claim the values were equal; rather, it stated it couldn't
        make the comparison due to lack of precise coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model is actually indicating that it cannot determine the relative
        east/west positioning due to lack of precise coordinates and because the locations
        are on different continents. This is effectively saying "NO, I cannot determine"
        which falls under the UNKNOWN category according to the criteria.

        being able to precisely pinpoint Marston Lake's location, I cannot definitively
        determine whether Serra de Monchique is east or west of it." This indicates

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model is actually indicating that it cannot determine the answer

        "Without that precise information, I cannot confidently state whether Serra
        de Monchique is east or west of this lake." This indicates the model is using
