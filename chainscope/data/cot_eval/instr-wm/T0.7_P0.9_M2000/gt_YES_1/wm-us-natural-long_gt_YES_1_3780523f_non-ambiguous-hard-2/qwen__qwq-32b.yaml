        of its reasoning, it states "Therefore, any point in New York is east of any
        point in Kansas. So Canada Lake, NY would be east of Lake Inman, KS. Therefore,
        the answer should be YES." However, the response was cut off before the model
        could provide a final, explicit answer. Since there's no clear final YES/NO
        statement that concludes the reasoning, the answer is classified as UNKNOWN.
