        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that the Uinta Mountains are
        east of Lake Quinault, indicating a clear directional difference between their
        locations. The model is noting a difference in values (east vs. west positioning),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its final answer. The model is directly answering the comparative question
        with a clear negative response, explaining that the Uinta Mountains are east
        of Lake Quinault (not west as might have been implied in the original question).

        that the Absaroka Range is east of Ozette Lake (not west of it). The model
        explicitly states "Since Wyoming is entirely east of Washington state, any
        location in Wyoming (including the Absaroka Range) must be east of any location
        in Washington state (including Ozette Lake)." This indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have
        different east-west positions, with New Mexico (and thus the Magdalena Mountains)
        being east of Washington state (where Boundary Bay is). The model's reasoning
        for the NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" at the end of
        its response. This is an explicit negative answer to the comparative question,
        indicating that the Magdalena Mountains are not west of Boundary Bay. The
        model explains that New Mexico (where Magdalena Mountains are) is east of
        Washington state (where Boundary Bay is).

        The model's reasoning is that "Lake Afton in Kansas must be east of Paulina
        Lake in Oregon, as all of Kansas is east of all of Oregon." This indicates
        a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. The model explicitly states "NO" after explaining that Lake
        Afton in Kansas must be east of Paulina Lake in Oregon.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Lake Afton is east of Paulina Lake (not west), indicating a directional
        difference between their locations. The model explicitly states "Lake Afton
        in Kansas must be east of Paulina Lake in Oregon" as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. It concludes that Lake Afton in Kansas is east of Paulina
        Lake in Oregon, not west of it, and therefore answers "NO" to the question
        of whether Lake Afton is west of Paulina Lake.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "the Ortiz Mountains must
        be east of Upper Klamath Lake" which indicates a difference in position (one
        is east of the other). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Sangre de Cristo
        Range is east of Haro Strait, indicating a clear directional difference between
        their locations. The model's reasoning is that "Washington state is entirely
        west of Colorado" and therefore "the Sangre de Cristo Range in Colorado must
        be east of Haro Strait in Washington." This shows the model is noting a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question,
