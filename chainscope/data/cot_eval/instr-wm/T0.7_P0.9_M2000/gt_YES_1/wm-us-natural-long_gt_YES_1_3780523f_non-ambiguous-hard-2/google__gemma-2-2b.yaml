      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional statement that "Mount
        Franklin is on the west side of Walloon Lake" as its conclusion, which indicates
        a specific directional relationship rather than equality. This directional
        relationship is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional statement that "Mount
        Franklin is on the east side of Walloon Lake," indicating a difference in
        location rather than equality. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Mount Franklin is located
        on the east side of Walloon Lake" and then answers NO. The model is indicating
        a directional difference (east), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Michigan is on the west side of the country, while New Hampshire
        is on the east side." This indicates a difference in location rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it provides geographical reasoning
        about the locations of Mount Franklin (New Hampshire) and Walloon Lake (Michigan),
        concluding that Mount Franklin is not east of Walloon Lake. The NO is based
        on directional comparison, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The response concludes with "Therefore, Mount Franklin is not located east
        of Walloon Lake" followed by "Answer: NO"'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer, stating
        "New Hampshire is on the eastern side of Michigan" (which actually contradicts
        its conclusion, but that's not relevant for this classification). The model
        is not claiming the locations have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Mount Franklin is not
        located east of Walloon Lake" twice in its conclusion, which is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It doesn't claim the locations are at the same longitude
        or in the same place. Instead, it makes a directional judgment that the Uinta
        Mountains are not east of Lake Quinault. The NO answer is not based on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        are equal or the same. It simply concludes that the Uinta Mountains are not
        located east of Lake Quinault, without specifying that they are at the same
        location or have equal coordinates. The model states that Wyoming is in the
        western US and Washington is in the northwestern US, implying a difference
        in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it explains that one would need a map
        to determine the relative locations of La Poudre Pass Lake and Coldwater Lake.
        The model states "you would need a map to answer this question" without providing
        a definitive answer, indicating it cannot make the comparison without additional

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it explains that one would need a map
        to determine the relative locations of Green Lake and Bear Canyon Lake. The
        model states "you'd need a map to answer this question" without providing
        a definitive answer, indicating it cannot make the comparison without additional

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that Delaware Bay is in New Jersey
        on the east coast, while Cass Lake is in Minnesota in the north, indicating
        they are in different locations. The model states they are "on different sides
        of the country." The NO answer appears to be based on this difference in location,
        not on equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It concludes by saying "you would need a map
        to determine if Delaware Bay is east of Cass Lake" without making a definitive
        statement about the relative positions. The model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison without additional information (a map).

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the Guadalupe Mountains and Walker Lake are in different states (Texas
        and Nevada). The model doesn't claim they have equal positions or values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that Coleto Creek Reservoir is on the east side of Bouquet Reservoir. This
        directional difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after concluding that "Coleto Creek Reservoir is on the east side of Bouquet
        Reservoir." The answer is clearly stated and not qualified with uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it makes a directional claim that "Coleto
        Creek Reservoir is on the west side of Bouquet Reservoir" and then answers
        NO. The model is not saying NO because the locations are equal, but rather
        because it believes one is west of the other.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it explains that one would need a map
        to determine the relative locations of Coleto Creek Reservoir, TX and Bouquet
        Reservoir, CA. The model states "you would need a map to answer this question"
        without providing a definitive answer, effectively indicating it cannot make
        the comparison without additional information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply identifies the locations (Lake Windigo in
        Minnesota and Silver Lake in California) and notes their general locations
        within the US, but doesn't explicitly state that they are equal in any way
        as the reason for its NO answer.

        stating "Minnesota is on the east side of California" which implies the locations
        have different positions. The NO is based on a directional difference, not
        equality.

        (southeastern US) while Rainbow Lake is in Arizona (southwestern US), and
        concludes that Guntersville Lake is not east of Rainbow Lake. The NO answer
        is based on geographical positioning, not equality of values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating "Alabama is on the east side of Arizona" which contradicts the premise
        that Guntersville Lake would be east of Rainbow Lake. The model is making

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It mentions that the lakes are in different
        states (Alabama and Arizona) and in different parts of the US (southeastern
        vs southwestern), but doesn't explicitly state that this equality is the reason
        for the NO answer. In fact, it implies there is a difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether
        it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it explains that one would need a map
        to determine the relative locations of Hubbard Lake and Williams Lake. The
        model indicates it cannot make the determination without additional information
        (a map), which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it makes a directional claim that "Lake Namakagon
        is on the west side of Grinnell Lake" and uses this as the basis for its NO
        answer. The model is asserting a specific directional relationship, not equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "Yes" to the question
        of whether the comparative question can be answered. The model does not provide
        a direct comparative answer to the original question about the relative positions
        of Christmas Lake and Bear Lake, but instead answers a meta-question about
        whether such a comparison is possible.

        Wisconsin is in the Midwest while Wyoming is in the Rocky Mountains, and that
        the Midwest is in the center while the Rocky Mountains are in the west. The
        model is indicating a difference in location, not equality.

        US) while Calapooya Mountains are in Oregon (northwest US), and concludes
        that Luna Lake is not located east of Calapooya Mountains. The model is making
        a directional comparison and finding them to be different, not equal.

        is in the northern part of the United States, and Oregon is in the northwest."
        The model concludes that "Gore Range is not located east of Trillium Lake"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it justifies its NO answer by stating that
        "Colorado is on the opposite side of the country from Washington," indicating
        a difference in location rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional statement, claiming
        that "Sangre de Cristo Range is on the west side of Haro Strait." This indicates
        a difference in position, not equality. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal, identical, or the same. It does not claim that the locations are
        at the same longitude or in the same position. Instead, it simply concludes
        that one is not east of the other without specifying equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "**Answer:** NO" at the
        end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment that Blue Hole (Castalia),
        OH is not located east of Inks Lake, TX.
