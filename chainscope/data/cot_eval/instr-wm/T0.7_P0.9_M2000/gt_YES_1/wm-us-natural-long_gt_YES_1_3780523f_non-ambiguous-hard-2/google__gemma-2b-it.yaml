      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Mount Franklin is located west
        of Walloon Lake, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The model is asserting a specific geographical relationship (west of) rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No" at the beginning of
        its response, indicating a negative answer to the comparison question. It
        then explains that Mount Franklin (New Hampshire) is located west of Walloon
        Lake, MI.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply notes that Mount Franklin is in New Hampshire
        and Walloon Lake is in Michigan, and concludes "NO" based on this information.
        The model does not explicitly state that the values are equal as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the "No" answer by
        explaining that the locations are in different regions of the United States
        (northeastern vs. Midwest). This indicates a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No." at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model did not explain
        that the locations have the same longitude or are at the same position. It
        simply stated that one is not east of the other without providing equality
        as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Mount
        Franklin (New Hampshire), NH is not located east of Walloon Lake, MI." This
        is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about geographic locations.

    c8bc22db-b3e0-467f-b844-47d38c210959:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Uinta Mountains,
        WY is located west of Lake Quinault, WA, indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The model is noting a difference in position, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that Uinta Mountains,
        WY is located west of Lake Quinault, WA. This is a definitive NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether
        it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a YES or NO answer. This is a clear refusal to make the
        comparison, indicating the model is declining to answer the question rather
        than attempting to provide a comparative result.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply notes that the Magdalena Mountains are in
        New Mexico and Boundary Bay is in Washington, implying they are in different
        locations. The model does not explicitly state that the values are equal as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"

    e21cb06c-e1fa-46d7-ae56-3b5ef61fc278:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model did not claim that
        the locations have the same longitude or are at the same position. It simply
        stated that one is not east of the other without explaining that they are
        equal or identical in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Magdalena
        Mountains, NM is not located east of Boundary Bay, WA." This is a direct NO
        answer to the comparative question about geographic locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - stating that Colorado is east of California, which contradicts the premise
        of the question. The model is claiming there is a directional difference (not
        equality) between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        La Garita Mountains are not located east of Boca Reservoir, CA." This is a
        clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states that La Garita Mountains
        are not located east of Boca Reservoir. The model does not mention equality
        as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, the model appears to be making a
        directional claim (implying that La Garita Mountains are west of Boca Reservoir,
        not east), rather than claiming the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. La Garita Mountains are not located east of Boca Reservoir." This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "La Garita Mountains, CO is
        located west of Boca Reservoir, CA" which indicates a directional difference
        (west vs east). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its conclusion, clearly indicating a negative response to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        Boca Reservoir is in California, not Colorado. This implies a geographical
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "THEREFORE, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that La Garita Mountains, CO cannot be located east of Boca Reservoir,
        CA because Boca Reservoir is in California and La Garita Mountains is in Colorado.
        The model is making a geographical reasoning claim, not claiming the locations
        are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        La Garita Mountains, CO is not located east of Boca Reservoir, CA, without
        specifying that this is because they are at the same longitude or in the same
        location. The model did not claim the locations are identical or equal in
        any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, La Garita

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference, stating
        that "Prien Lake, LA must be west of Ivanpah Lake, CA" (though this contradicts
        its earlier statement that "Louisiana is east of California"). The NO answer
        is based on a perceived directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that Louisiana and California are not adjacent states, so Prien Lake cannot
        be located east of Ivanpah Lake. This is a geographical reasoning rather than
        an equality claim.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that "Louisiana and California are located west of each other"
        and therefore "Prien Lake, LA cannot be located east of Ivanpah Lake, CA."
        The model is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning based on the geographic
        locations of the lakes and states, concluding that "Prien Lake, LA is not
        east of Ivanpah Lake, CA" because "Louisiana is east of California." The NO
        answer is based on a directional comparison, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values or
        any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" in its conclusion, clearly indicating that it believes Prien Lake,

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Charles Mound, IL is located
        west of Henry's Lake, ID, indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The model is asserting a specific geographical relationship (one
        being west of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for
        the NO answer - specifically that "the passage does not provide any information"
        to make the comparison. The NO is based on lack of information, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final comparative answer. It provides a reason for this answer (lack of
        information), but the answer itself is clearly stated as NO.

        that the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply states
        that Charles Mound, IL is not located east of Henrys Lake, ID without explaining
        that this is because they have the same longitude or are at the same position.
        There is no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Charles

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Charles Mound, IL cannot be located east of Henrys Lake,
        ID because the Midwest (where Charles Mound is) is east of the Pacific Northwest
        (where Henrys Lake is). This is not claiming equality but rather a directional

        the premise or correcting a factual error about location, not stating that
        the values being compared are equal. The model is pointing out a geographical
        discrepancy rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Maine is east of Georgia, and therefore Pushaw Lake is not
        located east of Jackson Lake. This indicates the model believes the locations
        have different values (different relative positions), not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Pushaw Lake, ME is located west
        of Jackson Lake, GA. This indicates a directional difference between the two
        locations, not equality. The model is asserting that one location is west
        of the other, which means they have different longitudinal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Pushaw
        Lake, ME is located west of Jackson Lake (Georgia), GA." This is a direct
        NO answer to the comparative question, indicating that one location is west
        of the other.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Sharpe,
        SD is located west of Wrights Lake, CA, indicating a directional difference
        between their locations. The model is asserting that one lake is west of the
        other, not that they have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that Lake Sharpe, SD
        is located west of Wrights Lake, CA. This is a definitive NO answer to the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the longitudes of the two lakes) are equal, identical, or the same. Instead,
        it makes a directional claim about Lake Sharpe being west of Wrights Lake,
        which actually contradicts its NO answer. Since equality of values is not
        given as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Lake Sharpe, SD is not west of Wrights Lake,
        CA. The model then contradicts itself by stating "Lake Sharpe, SD is located
        west of Wrights Lake, CA." Despite this contradiction, the model's final answer
        is clearly stated as "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply notes that Lake Sharpe is in South Dakota
        and Wrights Lake is in California, and then concludes "NO" based on this difference
        in location. The model is not claiming the values are equal as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that South Dakota is east of California, which means Lake Sharpe
        (in SD) is not east of Wrights Lake (in CA). The model is indicating a directional
        difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that Ballston Lake, NY is located west of Cross Lake, LA. This indicates
        a clear geographical difference between the two locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative answer to the comparative
        question. It then explains that Ballston Lake, NY is located west of Cross
        Lake (Shreveport, Louisiana), LA.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not provide any reasoning about the
        values being equal or the same. It simply states "The question is about Raystown
        Lake, PA and Lake Overholser, OK. So the answer is NO." There is no mention
        of equality being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for
        the NO answer - that the lakes "are located in different states, so they cannot
        be located east or west of each other." This is not claiming equality of values
        but rather rejecting the premise that the directional comparison applies.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the reason for this answer was because the locations have equal or identical
        values (such as being at the same longitude). The model simply stated that
        Brooks Pond is not east of Lake James without explaining that they are at
        the same location or have equal coordinates. There is no mention of equality
        or sameness as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Brooks
        Pond (Massachusetts), MA is not located east of Lake James (Indiana), IN."
        This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about geographic locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    bd86d2cb-09bb-47a3-8a6d-19fdadcba3d0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the two bodies of water
        are in different states (Massachusetts vs. Indiana), which indicates a difference
        in location rather than equality. The model is using this difference as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides geographical information about the two locations being in different
        states as justification for this answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states that it "cannot conclude
        from the context whether they are located east or west of each other" due
        to lack of information. The NO is based on insufficient information to make
        the comparison, not on equality of values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Marlboro Mountains, NY is not located east of Lac des Allemands, LA, without
        explaining that this is because the locations have the same longitude or are
        identical in position. The model did not provide any reasoning based on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Marlboro Mountains,
        NY is not located east of Lac des Allemands, LA." This is a clear negative
        answer to the comparative question about geographic locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Marlboro Mountains, NY is located
        west of Lac des Allemands, LA, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The model is asserting that one location is west of the other,
        not that they have the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that Marlboro Mountains,
        NY is located west of Lac des Allemands, LA. This is a definitive comparative
        answer.

        answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Blue Mountain (Pennsylvania), PA is not located
        west of Otter Tail Lake, MN. In fact, it then contradicts this by stating
        that Blue Mountain is located west of Otter Tail Lake. Despite this contradiction,
        the model's explicit answer is "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it claimed
        the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES, Big Spirit Lake,
        IA is located east of Castle Mountains (Montana), MT." The answer begins with
        a clear "YES" followed by the comparative statement.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Big Spirit Lake, IA is located
        west of Castle Mountains, MT. This indicates a directional difference between
        the locations (one is west of the other), not that they are at the same location
        or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Big Spirit
        Lake, IA is located west of Castle Mountains (Montana), MT." This is a direct
        NO answer to the comparative question, indicating a specific directional relationship
        between the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference - that Luna Lake is in Arizona while the Calapooya Mountains
        are in Oregon (different states).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer based
        on different geographical locations - one being in the southwestern US and
        the other in the northwestern US. This indicates a difference in values, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    76910e25-f141-46f9-be2e-97bbef8f4326:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer by
        noting that the Sangre de Cristo Range is in the western United States while
        Haro Strait is in the Pacific Northwest, implying they are in different locations.
        The model is noting a difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c8e43010-c25d-467d-975d-5929535bfed0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Sangre de Cristo Range, CO
        is located west of Haro Strait, WA" - indicating a directional difference
        (west of) between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        as its final answer. This is a clear NO response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    dc02ef06-58e3-4c3c-a13c-f25f91afa7b3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one location is west
        of the other (indicating a directional difference). The model is asserting
        a specific geographical relationship between the two locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Sangre de Cristo Range, CO is located west of Haro Strait, WA,
        which is a directional statement supporting its "No" answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ee041934-8324-4b9b-9faa-d73d59a60b6a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "The Sangre de Cristo Range is not
        located east of Haro Strait" as the reason for its NO answer, indicating a
        directional relationship rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
