      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Michigan is to the west of
        New Hampshire, indicating a difference in location. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO." It then explains that Mount Franklin is in New Hampshire and Walloon
        Lake is in Michigan, and that Michigan is to the west of New Hampshire.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    242e2f8d-ccb9-4bd6-bbb3-baa370c1acfe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific reason for the NO answer
        - that Mount Franklin is on the East Coast while Walloon Lake is on the West
        Coast of the United States. The model is noting a difference in locations,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED,
        this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and explains that "Without a map, it's impossible to answer definitively."
        This indicates the model is refusing to provide a definitive comparative answer
        due to lack of information.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Mount Franklin is in New Hampshire
        (northeast US) while Walloon Lake is in Michigan (midwest US). The model concludes
        NO based on this geographical relationship, not because they are in the same
        location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Mount Franklin is in New
        Hampshire on the East Coast while Walloon Lake is in Michigan in the Midwest,
        describing them as "on opposite sides of the country." The NO answer is based
        on this geographical difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it couldn't have given a NO
        answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem but
        did not actually provide a conclusion about whether Mount Franklin is east
        of Walloon Lake. The response ends with "Therefore:" but doesn't complete
        the conclusion, and then offers help with visualization instead of giving
        an answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Wyoming and Washington are "in different states" rather than on opposite
        sides of a large body of water. This is not an equality claim.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Wyoming is to the west of Washington." This indicates
        a difference in location, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "the Uinta Mountains are located
        in a different part of the country than Lake Quinault" as the reason for its
        NO answer. It specifically notes that Wyoming is in the western US while Washington
        is in the northwestern part, indicating a difference in location rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply identifies the locations (Uinta
        Mountains in Wyoming and Lake Quinault in Washington) but doesn't explicitly
        state they are at the same longitude or have equal east/west positions. The
        model gives NO as the answer without specifically citing equality as the reason.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides geographical reasoning about the
        locations of the Uinta Mountains and Lake Quinault, concluding that the Uinta
        Mountains are not east of Lake Quinault. The model does not claim the locations
        are identical or equal in any way.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides geographical reasoning about the
        locations of the Uinta Mountains (northeastern Wyoming) and Lake Quinault
        (Washington state) to conclude that the Uinta Mountains are not east of Lake
        Quinault. The model is making a directional comparison rather than claiming
        the locations are identical.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, claiming "Oklahoma is located west of California." Since
        it's asserting a directional difference (west vs. east) rather than equality,
        this is not a case where the NO is due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No. Oklahoma is located
        west of California." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question,
        though it appears to be factually incorrect (Oklahoma is east of California,
        not west). However, I'm only evaluating what the model stated, not factual
        accuracy.

        not east of Boundary Bay based on the relative locations of New Mexico and
        Washington states. The model concludes that New Mexico is in the southwestern
        US while Washington is in the northwestern US, which implies they have different
        positions, not equal ones.

        of the country" which indicates a difference in location, not equality. The
        NO answer appears to be based on this difference in location rather than on
        any equality between the values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Ten Mile Lake and Puente Hills are in different states (Minnesota and
        California).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the locations
        have equal or same values. It doesn't claim the locations are at the same
        longitude or in the same position. Instead, it notes that Minnesota and California
        are in different regions (Northern US vs Western US, Great Plains vs West
        Coast) and concludes Ten Mile Lake is "much further away geographically" -
        which implies difference, not equality. The model doesn't give equality as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the reasoning is somewhat unclear (saying Ten Mile Lake is "much further
        away geographically" doesn't directly address the east/west relationship),
        the model does provide a definitive "NO" answer to whether Ten Mile Lake is
        east of Puente Hills.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply identifies the locations of the
        two lakes (New York and Minnesota) and notes their general regions (northeast
        vs. Midwest), but doesn't explicitly state they are equal in any way as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        locations of the lakes in different states (New York and Minnesota). The model
        does not claim the lakes are at the same longitude or in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        that "Canandaigua Lake is in the east of the US, Red Lake is in the north."
        This difference in location is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Arkansas and Montana are "on opposite sides of the Mississippi River."
        This indicates a difference in location, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Arkansas is in the south and Montana is in the northwest" which
        led to the conclusion that "Shinall Mountain is not located east of the Bitterroot
        Range." The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.

        in Arkansas and Bitterroot Range in Montana) but doesn't explicitly state
        they are at the same longitude or equal in any way. The model doesn't provide
        any specific reason for its NO answer beyond identifying the locations.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it could not have given a NO
        answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it outlined steps for how to determine
        the answer (identify locations, map them, compare them) but did not actually
        complete these steps or provide a conclusion. The response ends with "Let

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "Is Minnesota located east of Wyoming?
        No." This indicates the model is saying Minnesota is not east of Wyoming,
        not that they are at the same location or have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It doesn't provide a clear reason for its NO answer,
        but it certainly doesn't claim equality as the reason. The model mentions
        locations in different states (Minnesota, California, Wyoming) but doesn't
        explicitly state they are equal in any way.

        Hills is in Minnesota and the Sierra Madre Range is in Wyoming, they are on
        different sides of the continental US." This indicates a difference in location,
        not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Wisconsin is in the northern part of the US and Wyoming is in
        the western part" and concludes that "Whitewater Lake is not located east
        of the Wind River Range." The model is not claiming equality but rather a
        directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "Oklahoma is in the southern United States and California is
        in the western United States" and therefore "Great Salt Plains Lake is not
        located east of the San Jacinto Mountains." The model is indicating a geographical

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it distinguishes that "Oklahoma is located
        in the south-central United States and California is in the western United
        States." The NO answer is not based on equality of values but appears to be
        an error, as Oklahoma is actually east of California. However, I'm only evaluating
        what was stated, not factual correctness.
