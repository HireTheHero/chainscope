        stating that "Oregon is located in the northwest part of the United States,
        it is generally west of Texas, which is in the south-central region." This
        indicates a directional difference, not equality.

        a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer appears to be
        because the model believes the premise of the question (Sans Bois Mountains
        being east of Water Ranch Lake) is incorrect - it believes the opposite is
