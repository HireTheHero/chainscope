        July 16, 2014, while "Nazi War Crimes Suspect, 98, Dies Awaiting Trial" was

        (July 23, 2014) than the first article (July 16, 2014). The model explicitly
        states "Since July 23, 2014 is later than July 16, 2014, the second article

        The model concludes that "Dutch Peacekeepers Are Found Responsible for Deaths"
        was published earlier than "Nazi War Crimes Suspect, 98, Dies Awaiting Trial"

        that "early 2014 is later than September 2013," meaning the Thai protester
