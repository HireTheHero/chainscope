      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it explains what would need to be done to answer
        the question (identify and compare publication dates) and then states it cannot
        provide the information needed ("I can't provide the exact publication dates
        without access to the NYT archives"). This indicates the model cannot make
