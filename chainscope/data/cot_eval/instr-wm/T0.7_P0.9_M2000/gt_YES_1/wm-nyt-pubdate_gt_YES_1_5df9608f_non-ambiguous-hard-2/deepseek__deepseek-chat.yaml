      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather UNKNOWN,
        this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether a NO answer
        was due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is UNKNOWN
        without additional information" and indicates it cannot definitively answer
        the question because it doesn't have access to the publication dates of the
        articles. The model clearly communicates that it cannot make the comparison
        without more information.

        are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that "March 17, 2013 (first article)
        is earlier than January 6, 2014 (second article)" - indicating a clear difference
        in dates. The NO answer was given because the first article was published
        earlier, not because the publication dates were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that "Shrinking Europe Military Spending Stirs
        Concern" was not published later than "Dozens Die in Attack on Police in Iraqi
        City." This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative question.'

        (the model couldn't determine the answer without specific dates), this automatically
        results in False for this question according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "Cannot be determined without specific dates" as its final
        answer, indicating it cannot make the comparison without additional information.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it cannot determine
        the answer due to lack of information.
