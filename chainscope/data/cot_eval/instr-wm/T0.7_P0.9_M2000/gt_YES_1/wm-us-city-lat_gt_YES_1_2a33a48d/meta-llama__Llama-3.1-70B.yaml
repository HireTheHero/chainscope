        to the question of whether Smelterville, ID is located north of Kellogg, ID.

      explanation_equal_values: "The model's NO answer is directly based on the equality\
        \ of the latitudes. It states \"both cities are at approximately the same\
        \ latitude (46.6\xB0N)\" and concludes that \"being at the 'same latitude'\
        \ means neither is north of the other.\" The equality of their positions is\
        \ the primary reason for the NO answer."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. The model concludes that Pelican Rapids,
        MN is not north of Moxee, WA based on its analysis of their latitudes.
