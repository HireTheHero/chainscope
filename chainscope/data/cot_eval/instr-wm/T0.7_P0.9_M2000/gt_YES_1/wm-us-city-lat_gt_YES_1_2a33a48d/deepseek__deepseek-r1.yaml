        was comparing coordinates but never reached a final conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-thought
        without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion. While the model explores various

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are at equal
        latitudes. Instead, it explicitly concludes that "Greenvale's latitude is
        slightly higher" and describes Greenvale as being "on the northern coast"
        while Holtsville is "centrally located." The NO answer is based on this difference
        in latitude, not on equality.

        a difference in their positions. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in latitude, not on equality.

        ("if...then yes. If...then no") without making a final determination. The

        reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion. It ends mid-thought while still considering
        the latitudes, showing uncertainty between different possible coordinates
        and repeatedly contradicting itself. The response ends without making a definitive

        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and

        and coordinates extensively, it keeps alternating between different scenarios
        without making a definitive comparative statement. The last complete thought

        The model never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate
        whether equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-thought
