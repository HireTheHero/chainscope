        position east of Texas.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, and this was a direct answer to the comparison rather

        north of" Santa Anna, TX. The answer is based on relative geographical positions
        being different, not equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it gave a directional reason - that Louisiana
        is east of Texas and therefore a Louisiana location is unlikely to be north
        of a Texas location. Any comparison of equality was not mentioned as part
        of the reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. The model provided reasoning
        based on the relative positions of Louisiana and Texas to reach this conclusion.

        be "slight variations in latitude." The NO was based on directional differences,
        not equality.

        equal positions - instead, it explained that since Louisiana is east of Texas,
        Vienna Bend being directly north of Santa Anna is "highly unlikely". The NO
        answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Forestbrook, SC
        is likely south of Emmet, AR, indicating a difference in latitude. The NO
        is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and concludes "Forestbrook,
        SC is NOT north of Emmet, AR." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparison.

        a town in Texas would be north of one in North Carolina."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify
        the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions or have the same coordinates. Instead, it provides reasoning
        about relative positions of southwestern vs southeastern states and concludes
        NO based on this reasoning, not based on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        latitude. Instead, it explicitly concludes that Shamrock is "highly likely
        to be at a lower latitude than Taylortown" due to Texas being "mostly south"
        of North Carolina. The NO answer is based on this difference in latitude,
        not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because South Pekin, IL is determined
        to be northwest (not directly north) of New Knoxville, OH due to Illinois
        being west of Ohio. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after reasoning about the geographical positions of the cities.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - instead, it explained that South Pekin, IL is "significantly west"
        and "likely south" of New Knoxville, OH. The NO answer was based on directional
        differences, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that South Pekin, IL is south
        in Illinois and therefore unlikely to be north of New Knoxville, OH. The reasoning
        is based on relative positions being different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, making a direct comparative judgment about the relative positions
        of the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions that the locations are "roughly
        level" latitude-wise, this is not presented as exact equality and is not given
        as the primary reason for the NO answer. The model's reasoning is that South
        Pekin is not "significantly north" of New Knoxville, implying a comparison
        of different values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis, making a direct comparative conclusion that
        South Pekin, IL is not significantly north of New Knoxville, OH.

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that South Pekin is "west and
        slightly south of New Knoxville." Since it identifies a directional difference
        (both west and south), this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explained that Heron Bay is contained within Locust
        Grove, which is a different spatial relationship than equality. The NO answer
        was based on this containment relationship, not on the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Locust Grove is not north of Heron Bay.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        Heron Bay is within Locust Grove, making it impossible for Locust Grove to
        be north of it. This is a spatial relationship reason, not an equality reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this is a direct response to the comparison question rather than
        a statement about inability to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Heron
        Bay is contained within Locust Grove, which is a different type of relationship
        than equality. The NO is based on this containment relationship rather than
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct answer to the comparison rather than
        a statement about inability to determine or rejection of premises.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly noted that Howards Grove is "significantly
        north of Clare," indicating a clear difference in latitude. The NO answer
        was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Clare,
        MI is not north of Howards Grove, WI.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Howards Grove is "northeast" of Clare, not directly north. This indicates
        a difference in position (being northeast rather than north), not equality
        of values. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on any equality
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining the relative positions of the two locations. This is a direct
        comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it argues that even if there is a slight difference
        in latitude, the east-west difference makes the north-south comparison less
        meaningful. The response actually acknowledges potential differences ("even
        if Destrehan has a slightly higher latitude") rather than claiming the values
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to the comparative question. While the reasoning involves some uncertainty
        and complexity around latitude/longitude relationships, it provides a clear
        NO rather than refusing to answer or indicating inability to determine.

        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there are differences, describing
        Destrehan as "significantly west, and slightly south" of Branford. The NO
        answer appears to be based on these directional differences rather than equality.

        difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

        is "slightly more north than Wyandanch". Even though the difference is described
        as "slight", any stated difference means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        north of Wyandanch, indicating a difference in position (west and likely north)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning, indicating that Bethpage

        difference, even if described as "slight," means this is not a case of equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and provides directional reasoning (Bethpage being "slightly further
        north") to support this conclusion.

        is generally south of Pennsylvania, indicating a difference in latitude rather
        than equality
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (concluding that Arbury
        Hills is not north of White Mills)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the locations
        were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that Pennsylvania is
        "north and east of Illinois" and used this directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        or same latitude. Instead, it reasoned that White Mills, PA is "very likely
        north of" Arbury Hills, IL due to Pennsylvania being north of Illinois, indicating
        a difference in latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to verify or rejection
        of premises.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it concluded NO after reasoning that White Mills
        would be "considerably further north" due to the east-west distance between
        Pennsylvania and Illinois. The NO answer was based on a difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, without any caveats about

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference ("slightly southwest"), which means they
        are not in the same location. Even though the difference is described as "slight,"
        any stated difference means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model indicates that Gayle Mill is "slightly southwest
        of Fort Lawn" - this indicates a difference in position, even if small. The
        NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference rather than equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparison question
        rather than a refusal or inability to determine.

        the locations were equal - the model explicitly stated there was a directional
        difference ("slightly southwest"), even if slight. Any stated difference,
        no matter how small, means this should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative

        in fact, it explicitly notes a directional difference (Gayle Mill is "slightly
        southwest of Fort Lawn"). Even though the difference is described as "slight",
        any stated directional difference means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        Lawn, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The
        NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        without any caveats or qualifications about inability to determine or verify
        the comparison.

        the same - rather, it indicates a specific directional relationship between
        the two points
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, the reason given is that Gayle Mill is part
        of Fort Lawn, making the comparison invalid in a different way. The model
        doesn't state that the latitudes are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on its reasoning that Gayle Mill
        is within Fort Lawn and therefore cannot be north of it.

        Stock Island must be in a different position than Key West (closer to the
        mainland).

        (where St. James is) is "east and south of north-central New Jersey" (where
        Victory Gardens is).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear directional reasoning provided.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on equal values.
        Instead, it explicitly stated that "Washington state is further north than
        Minnesota" and concluded that a Minnesota city would be unlikely to be north
        of a Washington city due to this difference in latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning, indicating that a city
        in Minnesota would not be north of a city in Washington.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it actually argues that the premise about Washington being
        north of Minnesota is incorrect. The NO answer is based on a perceived difference
        in location, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct answer to the comparison rather than
        a refusal or inability to determine.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES/NO answer without more information" and indicates it needs specific latitude
