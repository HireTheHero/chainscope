      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Holtsville is south of Greenvale, not because the locations are at the same

      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot determine the comparison
        due to being unable to verify one location, but then gives "NO" because it
        was required to give a YES/NO answer. Since the model explicitly states it
        cannot determine the comparison, this falls under the UNKNOWN category where

        at the same location. Instead, it explicitly states that Smelterville is south
        of Kellogg, indicating a difference in position. The NO is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        as its final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the geographic
        relationship between the two cities.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Smelterville is "just south of Kellogg," indicating a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        explicitly states a directional difference ("Smelterville is located just
        west of Kellogg")

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it specifically states that

        difference. Even though they are described as "very close," the model identifies
        a specific directional relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and "Smelterville is

        Instead, it explicitly states that East Orosi is "located just south of Sultana,"
        indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.

        East Orosi is south of Sultana, not because the locations are at the same
        position. It explicitly states "East Orosi is actually located south of Sultana"
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one
        location's position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because I cannot confirm the
        location and thus cannot verify the geographic relationship)". Since this
        is explicitly stating an inability to determine/verify the comparison rather
        than a comparative result, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO to this question" and indicates it cannot determine the relationship
        due to uncertainty about one location's existence. This is a case where the
        model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        the locations were equal - it simply couldn't verify one location's existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot definitively answer YES
        or NO" but then gives a forced NO answer that is qualified with "because I
        do not have evidence to support a YES." This indicates uncertainty rather
        than a definitive comparative result, making this an UNKNOWN response.
