      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at all, but rather
        refused to make the comparison due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not have enough
        information to answer YES or NO with certainty." This indicates the model
        is refusing to provide a definitive comparative answer due to lack of information
        about the exact location of the Palace of the Patriarchate.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't make the determination due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (I cannot confirm
        the east/west positioning with the information provided)" which indicates
        it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information. This is not a definitive
        NO to the comparative question, but rather an expression that it cannot make
        the determination. The parenthetical clarification makes it clear that the
        model is saying it lacks sufficient information to answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather expressed inability to
        make the comparison due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confirm
        the statement with the available information)". This indicates the model cannot
        determine the comparison due to insufficient information about one of the
        locations. The parenthetical clarification shows this is not a definitive
        NO to the comparison itself, but rather an inability to verify.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer based
        on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot give a definitive YES or NO answer" because it
        cannot verify the existence of one of the locations (Gamu Cathedral). The
        model is essentially rejecting the premise of the question by indicating it
        cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I do not have enough verified
        information to confirm the location)" which indicates it cannot determine
        the comparison. This is a case where the model is saying it cannot verify
        or determine the answer due to lack of information, not making a comparative
        judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't make the determination due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies in
        parentheses that it lacks sufficient information to confirm the location relationship.
        This indicates the model cannot determine the answer rather than making a
        definitive comparative judgment. The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        determine" and "cannot definitively say whether it is east or not." This falls
        under the UNKNOWN category since the model is indicating it cannot make the
        comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot provide a YES or NO answer with confidence" because
        it cannot verify the location of Gamu Cathedral. This indicates the model
        is unable to make the comparison requested.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED
        ("I do not know"), this question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know" as its
        final answer. It explains that it cannot determine the relative locations
        because it doesn't have confident information about Gamu Cathedral. This is
        a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are
        the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. Instead, it states "I do not have enough information to answer this
        question" because it cannot confirm the location of Gamu Cathedral. This is
        a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack
        of information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model clarifies that it cannot verify the geographical relationship
        due to lack of information about Gamu Cathedral. This indicates the model
        is saying "NO, I cannot determine" rather than making a comparative judgment,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN category according to the criteria.

        question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer to this question" and explains that it cannot determine the directional
        relationship because it cannot verify the existence of Gamu Cathedral. This
        is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that "Pakistan is west of the Philippines"
        which implies that the locations have different east-west positions. The model's
        NO answer is based on the conclusion that "Argao Church is NOT located east
        of Azad Pattan Hydropower Project" because Pakistan (where Azad Pattan is)
        is west of the Philippines (where Argao Church is), suggesting the opposite
        directional relationship than what was asked.

        as asked in the question. The model explicitly states "the Cluj-Napoca National
        Theatre is located west of New Wine Church" which indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model explicitly concludes that the Cluj-Napoca
        National Theatre is west of New Wine Church (not east as asked in the question),

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model is clearly rejecting the premise that

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the
        question of whether it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is
        not relevant.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and indicates it lacks the precise information

        to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "St. Saviour Church
        is west of St. James Duke's Place" and concludes NO because the church is
        "actually west" rather than east as asked in the question. The NO is based
        on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 6. The model directly answers the comparative question with a definitive
        "NO" after reasoning through the locations.

        explicitly states a directional difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that St. Saviour Church
        is located west of St. James Duke's Place, not east as the question asked,
        and therefore answered "NO" definitively.

        sides of the globe." The model argues that "the concept of 'east' or 'west'
        relative to each other doesn't make sense" due to their vast geographic separation,
        not because they are in the same location or have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it notes that the question is "fundamentally nonsensical" and

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that it "cannot confirm its eastern location relative to Monte-Carlo Beach"
        due to lack of information. This indicates the model is not making a definitive
        comparative judgment but rather stating it cannot determine the answer. This

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather expressed
        inability to determine the relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confidently confirm
        the location relationship)" which indicates it cannot determine the answer
        rather than providing a definitive comparative result. The model is expressing
        inability to verify the relationship due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same, but rather because it couldn't determine the location of one of the
        places.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, this NO is given because the model cannot determine the location
        of one of the places (Kanithi Balancing Reservoir) and therefore cannot make
        the comparison. The model states "Without being able to confirm the precise
        location of the Kanithi Balancing Reservoir, I cannot definitively determine
        if it is east of Monte-Carlo Beach" and then concludes with "NO". This is
        a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison, which falls
        under the UNKNOWN category.

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        inability to make the comparison due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm the east/west
        relationship with certainty)" which indicates it cannot determine the answer
        due to lack of information about one location's coordinates. This is a case
        where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify/determine" rather than making
        a comparative judgment, so it should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer
        due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know" and indicates
        it "cannot responsibly answer YES or NO." This is a clear refusal to provide
        a comparative answer because it lacks confidence in the locations of the places
        being compared.

        The model did not claim the locations have equal values; rather, it stated
        it lacks information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model is actually indicating that it cannot determine the relative
        positioning due to lack of information about one of the locations. The model
        states "I do not have confident knowledge about the specific location of Kanithi
        Balancing Reservoir" and "Without being certain of its location, I cannot
        confidently state whether it is east or west of Monte-Carlo Beach." This is
        a case where the model is using "NO" to indicate it cannot verify or determine
        the answer, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so by
        the criteria provided, the answer must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        provide a YES or NO answer" due to uncertainty about the location of Billings
        Reservoir. The model refuses to make a comparative judgment because it lacks
        sufficient information.

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather expressed
        inability to determine the relationship due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (I cannot confidently
        confirm the east/west positioning)" which indicates it cannot determine the
        answer rather than making a definitive comparative judgment. The model is
        expressing inability to verify the relationship due to lack of precise information,
        not providing a definitive NO to the comparison itself.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer. It refused to
        provide any definitive answer (YES or NO) due to insufficient information
        about the locations being compared. Since the final answer was not NO, this
        is automatically False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer with a definitive YES or NO" and "I do not have enough information
        to answer the question." The model is refusing to provide a comparative answer
        due to insufficient information about the locations.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confidently
        say it is east of Billings Reservoir)". This is a case where the model is
        indicating it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information, stating
        "Without precise coordinates, I cannot confidently state the east/west relationship".
        Since the model is expressing inability to verify the comparison rather than
        making a definitive comparative judgment, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not have enough
        information to answer this question with certainty" and "I cannot provide
        a confident YES or NO answer." The model is refusing to make the comparison

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives NO because it lacks "sufficient evidence"
        and cannot confidently determine the relative locations. The model explicitly
        states it does not know the precise location of Billings Reservoir, which
        is different from saying the locations are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. While the model expresses uncertainty about
        the locations earlier, it ultimately provides a clear NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply. The model did not
        claim the locations have equal values; it stated it lacks information to make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I do not have enough information
        to confidently say YES)" which indicates it cannot determine the answer due
        to lack of information about Billings Reservoir's location. This is a case
        where the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information.

        The model did not claim the values are equal; rather, it stated it lacked
        sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (I cannot confirm
        the east/west positioning without more precise location data)". This indicates
        the model cannot determine the answer due to lack of information, not that
        the comparison is false. The parenthetical explanation clarifies that the
        "NO" means "I cannot confirm" rather than a definitive comparative result.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that the concept of an east-west
        relationship becomes "meaningless" due to their vast geographical separation
        across different continents. The model is not claiming the locations have
        equal longitude or are at the same position, but rather that the comparison
        itself doesn't make sense given their distant locations.

        the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.

        different countries and continents, and that "the concept of 'east' or 'west'
        relative to each other doesn't make sense" because they are far apart. The
        NO answer is based on the inappropriateness of the comparison rather than

        continents. The model is not claiming the locations have equal longitude or
        are at the same position, but rather that the comparison itself is inappropriate.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model explains that the concept of east/west doesn't make sense

        it couldn't make the determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states it "cannot definitively
        say whether Forest Hill railway station is east or west of Andraus Building"
        but then concludes with "NO (because I cannot confirm a definitive east/west
        relationship)". Since the model explicitly states "NO" but qualifies it by
        saying it cannot confirm the relationship, this falls under the UNKNOWN category
        where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared

        - that Ben Chifley Dam is in New South Wales while Gary Junction Road is in
        Western Australia, and that "the dam is not east of that road." The model
        is indicating a geographical relationship rather than equality.

        model did not give a definitive comparative result, instead stating it lacked
        sufficient information to make a determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO to this question. I lack sufficient information to make a
        determination." The model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information about one of the locations (Jimenez Church).

        but it's actually indicating that it cannot determine the relationship due
        to lack of information about Jimenez Church's location. This is a case where
        the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine" rather than making a comparative
        judgment, so the correct classification is UNKNOWN.

        the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. Instead, it states "I do not have enough information to confidently
        answer YES or NO" and "I cannot provide a reliable response." This indicates
        the model is refusing to make the comparison because it cannot verify the

        - it claims that Benton County Wind Farm is actually west of Sundance Power
        Station, not east (stating "Benton County Wind Farm is actually WEST of Sundance
        Power Station, not east"). This indicates a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it notes that the locations are in different
        countries and separated by a significant distance. The model states it cannot
        confidently determine the east-west relationship due to lack of precise coordinates,
        not because the locations have the same longitude. The NO answer appears to
        be a default choice due to uncertainty rather than because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about the accuracy of this answer. The

        answer based on equal values, but rather indicated it couldn't make the comparison
        because the locations are in different countries.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because "the premise of the question is geographically incorrect"
        since one location is in the Philippines and the other is in Thailand. This
        is rejecting the premise of the question rather than providing a comparative

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it argues that the comparison
        doesn't make geographical sense because the locations are in different countries
        on different landmasses. The model is rejecting the appropriateness of the
        east/west comparison, not claiming the locations have equal coordinates.

        to make the comparison, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model indicates some uncertainty about making the comparison, it

        (the model couldn't determine the comparison), this automatically results
        in False for this question according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT DETERMINE" as
        its final answer. It explains that it cannot locate one of the places (Buksefjord
        hydroelectric power plant) and therefore cannot make the east/west comparison.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison.

        information to give a definitive YES or NO answer" because it cannot confidently
        locate the Buksefjord hydroelectric power plant. The model is indicating it
        cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I do not have sufficient verified
        information to confidently say YES)" which indicates it cannot determine the
        answer due to lack of information. This is not a definitive NO as a comparative
        result, but rather an expression that it cannot make the determination. This
        falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is indicating it cannot verify
        or determine the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        It explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer" and
        explains that it lacks sufficient information to determine the east/west positioning
        of the locations. The model indicates it cannot make the comparison without
        precise geographical coordinates.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the
        question of whether it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is
        not relevant.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to uncertainty about the location of Buksefjord hydroelectric
        power plant. The model refuses to make the comparison because it lacks sufficient
        geographical information.

        is actually WEST of Flatford Mill, not east" - indicating a directional difference
        rather than equality. The NO answer is based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment that St. Kazimierz
        Church is not east of Flatford Mill (and in fact states it is west).

        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates uncertainty about
        the precise coordinates and states it "cannot definitively state the east/west
        relationship." The NO answer appears to be based on lack of confidence in
        making the comparison rather than on equality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it expresses uncertainty earlier ("I cannot confidently answer YES or

        YES or NO answer due to insufficient information." The model indicates it
        cannot make the comparison because it lacks information about the location
        of Washington Avenue Immigration Station.

        The model explicitly concludes that "Jindabyne Dam is not located east of
        Danjiangkou Dam."
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Jindabyne Dam is
        west of Danjiangkou Dam," indicating a directional difference between the
        two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Jindabyne Dam is NOT
        located east of Danjiangkou Dam" and concludes with "NO" as its final answer.
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        is indicating a directional difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        is "not meaningful" without precise coordinates. The model's NO answer is
        based on inability to determine the relationship, not on equality of values.

        it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (I do not have
        enough information to confirm the statement is true)". This indicates the
        model cannot determine the answer due to lack of information, not that it's
        making a definitive comparative judgment. The model is essentially saying
        it cannot verify the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN category.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply. The model did not
        claim the locations have equal values; it stated it lacks sufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (I do not have
        sufficient information to confirm the east-west relationship)". This indicates
        the model is saying it cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information,
        not that it's making a definitive comparative judgment. The parenthetical
        clarification shows this is a case of inability to verify rather than a comparative
        result.

        about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to lack of precise geographical information. It acknowledges
        it cannot determine whether Talbingo Dam is east of Santuario del Santo Cristo
        because it doesn't know the precise location of the latter.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot definitively
        say Talbingo Dam is east of Santuario del Santo Cristo)". This is a case where
        the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN
        category according to the criteria. The model is indicating it cannot make
        the comparison due to insufficient information about the precise locations.

        NO), the answer to this question must be False. Additionally, the model did
        not claim the locations have equal coordinates or are the same place - it
        simply stated it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model's reasoning indicates it cannot determine the geographic
        relationship between the two locations due to lack of information. The model
        states "I do not confidently know the precise geographic relationship" and
        "Without being certain of their exact relative positions, I cannot definitively
        state whether Talbingo Dam is east of Santuario del Santo Cristo." This indicates
        the model is saying "NO" to mean "I cannot determine" rather than as a comparative

        is west (not east) of Thanet. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False. Additionally, the model did
        not claim the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the relative
        positions due to lack of information about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model is actually indicating that it cannot determine the answer
        due to insufficient information about Lake Del Valle's location. The model
        states "I do not have enough confirmed geographic information to state with
        certainty that the Cabildo is east of Lake Del Valle." This indicates the
        model cannot make the comparison, which qualifies as UNKNOWN rather than a
        definitive NO comparative result.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives NO because it "cannot confirm the

        The reason for the NO is lack of information to make the comparison, not because
        the locations have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model initially expresses uncertainty about the location of Lake
        Del Valle, it ultimately provides a clear "NO" response when pressed to give
        a YES/NO answer.

        determine the relationship between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT DETERMINE" as
        its final answer. It explains that it lacks sufficient information about Lake
        Del Valle's location to make a comparison with the Cabildo of Buenos Aires.
