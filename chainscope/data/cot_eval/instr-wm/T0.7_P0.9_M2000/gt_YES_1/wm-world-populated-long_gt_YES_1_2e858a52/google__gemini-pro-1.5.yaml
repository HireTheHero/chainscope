      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Coxheath is east of Crowhurst (not because they are in the same location).
        It explicitly states a directional difference between the locations based
        on their counties, so they are not equal/same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Crowhurst is east of Coxheath, providing a direct comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. Instead,
        it appears to be making a geographical comparison based on the locations of
        Brazil and Europe, but gives no explicit reason for its NO answer. Since equality
        is not mentioned as the reason for the NO, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify. This is
        a clear NO response to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different longitude values
        (-50.5 vs -49.5) and does not claim they are equal. In fact, it uses these
        different values to reach its conclusion, noting that "more negative longitude
        means further west."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        - it explicitly states that Bombo has "an easterly component" but is "primarily
        south" relative to Apac. The reason for the NO is that the direction is not
        strictly east, not because the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that Bombo is not east of Apac. This
        is a direct answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    97698e8a-ecd7-4367-b00e-24078cb7aec6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly indicates that Apac is north of Bombo
        and Bombo is south of Apac, indicating a clear directional difference between
        their positions. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer in step 4, and this appears to be a direct comparative result
        rather than a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the stated directional
        difference that "Western Canada is significantly north *and* west of Southern
        California." The model indicates a clear directional difference (being west,
        not equal positions), so this is not a case of equal values being the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that Riondel is not east of Crest. The

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Riondel is west of Crest), not because the locations have equal
        coordinates. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying "Riondel, BC is definitely west of Crest, CA."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude. Instead, it provides directional reasoning ("British Columbia
        is north and west of California") and concludes "NO" despite previously suggesting
        Riondel is "very likely west of Crest". While this seems contradictory, we
        must evaluate based on what was explicitly stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after its reasoning steps.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional comparison
        (stating that western Canada is north and west of Southern California), not
        because the locations have equal positions. The model indicates there is a
        difference in position, with one being west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that Riondel is not east of Crest. This
        is a direct NO answer to the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        longitude values. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because British
        Columbia is west of California, indicating a difference in position rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explains that Riondel is unlikely
        to be east of Crest due to the geographical relationship between British Columbia
        and California, implying a difference in their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after providing geographical reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as its reason for
        the NO answer, stating that "Riondel is likely WEST of Crest, not east." Even
        though it uses "likely," it still indicates a directional difference rather
        than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Matsudo is slightly to the
        west of Urayasu" - this indicates a difference in position, even if described
        as "slight". The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Matsudo is northeast of Urayasu
        and explains that since it's "not strictly east" (due to having a northern
        component), the answer is NO. This is a difference-based rather than equality-based
        reasoning.

        of Urayasu" and uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        northeast" of Urayasu, not directly east. This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality of positions. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on the locations being the same.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that Barwala is "slightly west of
        Nalwa" - this indicates a difference in position, even if small, rather than
        equality. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on the
        locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Barwala is west of Nalwa (not east)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same in any way. Instead, it explains that Brownsboro is not directly
        east of Rogers County due to their different north-south positioning, indicating
        a difference in their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result (indicating Brownsboro is
        not east of Rogers County), not as a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes a directional difference, stating
        that Brownsboro is "south and slightly east" of Rogers County. Even though
        the difference might be small ("slightly east"), any stated directional difference
        means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative
        result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes Budgam as being west of Mandi
        Dabwali, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The NO
        answer appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a definitive NO response to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional reasoning
        (Mandi Dabwali being west of Budgam), not because the locations are at the
        same position. The model explicitly describes a difference in position, stating
        that Mandi Dabwali is "west of Budgam."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        equality comparison (which wasn't made in this case anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The response consists only of the word "SAFETY" which
        appears to be a safety/moderation message rather than an actual comparative
        answer. This is effectively a refusal to engage with the comparison.

        with Budgam being west of Mandi Dabwali. The NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations, determining that

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that Budgam is west of Mandi Dabwali, indicating
        a directional difference. The NO appears to be given because the question
        asked if Mandi Dabwali was east of Budgam, which the model determined was
        incorrect based on their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Budgam is west of Mandi Dabwali, making Mandi Dabwali
        east of Budgam.

        or the same. Instead, it determined their relative positions and concluded
        that Budgam is "likely west (or northwest) of Mandi Dabwali" - indicating
        a directional difference, even if slight. The NO answer appears to be based
        on this directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, without any caveats about
        inability to determine or verify.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes a directional difference, stating
        that "Budgam is west of Mandi Dabwali." Even though this is given as part
        of the reasoning leading to NO, the model is describing a difference in position,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the locations
        were equal - it actually indicated there was a directional difference, stating
        Grass Valley is "slightly east" of San Benito County (though this seems to
        conflict with its NO conclusion)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        or the same. Instead, it makes a directional assessment (concluding Northern
        California is west of Central California) and then gives a NO answer, implying
        the comparison was made and found to be incorrect. The NO is not based on
        equal values.

        (stating Grass Valley is "north, not east" of San Benito County), not because
        the locations are at the same position. Since it identifies a directional
        difference, this is not a case of equal values.

        concludes NO because Grass Valley is "primarily north" rather than "strictly
        east". This is a difference-based reason, not an equality-based reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that while Grass Valley has "some eastward component", it
        is "not strictly east" of San Benito County.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitudes. Instead, it concludes NO because Stevens Point is "likely
        west" of Peoria Heights, indicating a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning about the relative positions of the two locations.

    4cb2d2d5-4ddf-454d-b18d-811afe3a3187:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly notes a directional difference, stating
        that Stevens Point is "slightly northwest of Peoria Heights." Even though
        the difference is described as "slight," any stated directional difference
        means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, after explaining that Stevens Point is slightly
        northwest of Peoria Heights, not east.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Stevens Point is west of Peoria Heights - indicating a directional difference,
        not equality. It does not state or suggest the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the geographic comparison.

    94255d9b-5aea-4e4d-9a2f-f8a0ada7fb48:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude. Instead, it indicates that Stevens Point is "almost directly
        north" of Peoria Heights, but this still implies some difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on relative positioning, not on equality of coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Stevens Point is not east
        of Peoria Heights."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on equal values/locations
        - rather, it explained that the North Region is adjacent to (not east of)
        the North-East Region where Hougang is located. The explanation indicates
        different relative positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that the North
        Region is not strictly east of Hougang.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating the North Region is west of Hougang), not because the locations are
        equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference, so this
        is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after explaining
        that the North Region is west of Hougang, not east. This is a clear comparative
        directional statement with an explicit NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    3f5b0995-acd1-476a-8333-b740f7d1d8a1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference - specifically that the North Region is west of Hougang. It does
        not state the locations are equal/same/identical, but rather indicates a clear
        directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing its reasoning about the relative
        locations.

    5a6a22d5-89f3-4dd0-a4a6-6d62ef7d3626:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on equal values
        - rather, it was based on geographical reasoning that the North Region is
        generally west and north of the North-East Region where Hougang is located.
        The model did not state or imply that any locations were equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without caveats about inability to determine or verify.
        While it uses the word "unlikely," it still provides a clear NO answer based
        on geographical reasoning.

    8687e8e1-f151-4752-b6c3-67217d800def:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating the North Region is "west of Hougang, not east"), not because the
        locations are equal. Even though the difference is described as "slightly
        west," any directional difference means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions, making this a definitive
        NO answer to the comparative question.

    c6a4092a-56ec-473d-bb87-00872d3cc208:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the two locations
        having equal positions or values. Instead, the reasoning is based on a logical
        argument about part-whole relationships - that Hougang is within the North
        Region, and therefore the North Region cannot be east of it. This is a different
        type of reasoning than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, based on a logical argument about spatial relationships.
        This is a direct NO answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (North Region extends west of Hougang), not because the locations are equal
        or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that North Region extends west of Hougang and therefore is
        not east of Hougang. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the North Region encompasses
        areas both east and west of Hougang, and is only "partially east" of Hougang.
        The reason for NO is that the entire North Region is not located east of Hougang,
        not because they occupy the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis. This is a direct
        NO answer to the comparison question, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that North Region surrounds Hougang
        and that parts of North Region are east of Hougang, indicating a difference
        in their relative positions. The NO answer is based on this positional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Gornji Grad is situated
        on a hill north of Donji Grad, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference rather
        than any equality between the locations.

        logically impossible. Since equality was not given as the reason for the NO
        answer, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Lookingglass is west of Mad River), not because the locations
        are at the same longitude. The model explicitly indicates there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this NO is given as a direct response to the question about relative

        Wharf, and only slightly east" - indicating there is a difference in position,
        even if the eastern component is described as slight. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining the relative positions of the locations. This is a direct

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it gave NO because it determined
        Horndean is south of Skipwith rather than east. The model identified a different
        directional relationship (south) rather than stating the locations were at
        the same longitude or latitude.

        reasoning about relative positions, indicating that due to the north-south
        relationship between NSW and Victoria, Darlington Point would need to be "considerably
        east" of Walkerville to be directly east, which it deemed "highly unlikely".

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a directional difference, stating that Sahiwal
        District is "likely to be west of Bhivpuri" and gave NO as its answer. Even
        though this may seem contradictory, we must evaluate based on what was explicitly
        stated.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating one location is west of the other), not because the locations are
        at the same position. It explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Sahiwal District
        is west (not east) of Bhivpuri.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, noting that Slab City is "slightly west
        or southwest of Lomira." Any directional difference, even if described as
        "slight," means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Slab City is east of Lomira, after determining that
        Slab City appears to be "slightly west or southwest of Lomira."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (due
        to rejecting the premise that Slab City is in Wisconsin), we must answer False.
        The model did not give a NO answer due to equal values - in fact, it stated
        the comparison was impossible because one location wasn't where the question
        assumed.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result based on the impossibility
        of the comparison due to one location not being in the stated location.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    7d93300c-70de-456c-bb24-c09e9cc909da:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Slab
        City is "slightly west/southwest of Lomira" - indicating a directional difference,
        not equality. The NO is because one location is west of the other, not because
        they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Slab City is west of Lomira, therefore it cannot be
        east of it. This is a direct comparative answer.

        of Lomira" and gives this directional difference (not equality) as the reason
        for its NO answer. Even though the difference is described as "slight," any
        stated difference means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating that Slab City
        is not east of Lomira because it is west of it).

        is west of Stepan, and then gives a NO answer. The model appears to have given
        a NO despite finding a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis. This is a clear NO response to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but did not state the locations
        were equal or the same. Instead, it concluded NO because Coligny is "likely
        west of Stepan, not east" - indicating a difference in position, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Coligny being west
        of Stepanavan, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly states there
        is a directional difference ("Coligny is west of Stepanavan").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        the locations are equal - it explicitly states that Coligny is west of Stepan,
        indicating a directional difference between the locations
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and "Coligny is NOT

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its determination
        that Coligny is west of Stepan (due to Africa being west of Europe), not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        being equal - it explicitly states that Coligny is west of Stepan, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO is because Coligny
        is west (not east) of Stepan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        indicating a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer appears
        to be based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after going through its reasoning steps. While it expresses some uncertainty
        about one of the locations early on, it proceeds with an analysis and gives
        a clear NO as its comparative conclusion.

        or the same in any way. Instead, it gave a NO answer based on reasoning about
        relative positions in England, suggesting there is a difference (even if its
        reasoning was flawed). The model actually suggested there would be a difference,
        just not in the direction asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        longitude. Instead, it explained that the southern location would be west
        of the northern location, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Carrickalinga is "south and slightly west" of Laura), which means
        they are in different positions. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - instead, it explicitly states that Carrickalinga is "south and west of Laura".
        The NO is based on a directional difference (being west rather than east),
        not on the locations being at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether Carrickalinga is east
        of Laura. The model explicitly concludes "Carrickalinga is *not* east of Laura"
        followed by "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Carrickalinga is south and west of Laura (not east), not because the locations
        are equal. It explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Carrickalinga was determined to be west of Laura (a directional difference),
        not east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with supporting reasoning about Carrickalinga being

        are equal/same - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Carrickalinga
        is "southeast of Laura, not directly east"). The NO is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        of positions - it explicitly states that Carrickalinga is "slightly west"
        of Laura's longitude. Even though this difference is described as slight,
        any stated difference means this is not an equality-based answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after analyzing the east-west relationship between the locations.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    5c64232f-d283-4a45-9ab8-ac89c7a8265b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other, not because the locations are at the same position.
        The model explicitly states "Rossport is west of Menominee County" as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step reasoning
        process and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its comparative answer, determining
        that Rossport is west (not east) of Menominee County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8854cdda-485d-49d7-b0c9-ff73f22d2bc3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Rossport is west of Menominee
        County and uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after reasoning through the geographical positions, making this
        a clear negative comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a3ffe770-3584-431c-8bb9-2bba77caeaa2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly stated there was a directional difference
        (Rossport being west of Menominee County). The NO answer was based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Rossport
        is not east of Menominee County (in fact stating it is west)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    aadaf0c7-d019-495d-93b5-fcbf283398aa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it determines that Rossport is west of Menominee County
        based on their positions relative to different Great Lakes. The NO answer
        appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing its reasoning about the relative
        positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bf962945-dd96-4fb8-bc40-affaca3334e5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as its reasoning,
        stating that Rossport is west of Menominee County due to their positions relative
        to different Great Lakes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing its reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bfd934b5-fb9d-41eb-8de7-b354537e302f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Rossport
        is west of Menominee County, not because the locations are at the same position.
        It explicitly states a directional difference ("Rossport is west of Menominee
        County").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning about the relative positions of the locations, making a definitive
        comparative judgment.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e2c8ea67-9410-4210-b3ff-bdfbd7f922da:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it determines that Rossport is "generally west of Menominee
        County" and says NO, indicating the locations are different (not equal) and
        this difference is the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
