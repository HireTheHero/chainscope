      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a directional difference, saying that Crowhurst is west of Coxheath. The
        NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with an explicit statement "Crowhurst, East Sussex is NOT located east of
        Coxheath. It is located to the west of Coxheath." This is a direct comparative
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Coxheath is east of Crowhurst,
        indicating a clear directional difference between their positions. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO - Crowhurst,
        East Sussex is not located east of Coxheath" as its final answer. This is
        a direct comparative NO response to the question asked.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that Crowhurst
        is positioned to the west of Coxheath, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO was based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Crowhurst
        in East Sussex is not located east of Coxheath" as its final answer. This
        is a direct comparative answer without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly
        states that Crowhurst is located WEST of Coxheath, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final conclusion, and specifically states that "Crowhurst,
        East Sussex is not located east of Coxheath." The model provides a definitive
        comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that Crowhurst
        would be southwest of Coxheath and that "Coxheath is actually east and slightly
        north of Crowhurst." The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Crowhurst,
        East Sussex is not located east of Coxheath" as its final answer. This is
        a direct comparative answer without any caveats about uncertainty or inability
        to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Crowhurst lies "west and slightly
        south of Coxheath" and gives a directional difference as the reason for its
        NO answer. The NO is based on Crowhurst being west of Coxheath, not because
        they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Crowhurst is not located
        east of Coxheath. It is located west of Coxheath." This is a definitive NO
        answer to the comparative question.

        of Mad River ("It is actually located west of Mad River, California"), indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Lookingglass, Oregon

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't identify
        one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model ends with "NO - I cannot confirm that Lig
        is east of Leknes because I cannot identify 'Lig' as a known geographic location."
        This is a case where the model states NO but immediately qualifies it as being
        unable to determine the comparison due to not being able to identify one of
        the locations. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria where
        "The model indicates it cannot make the comparison."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion, so the question of equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and explains that it cannot determine the location relationship
        due to insufficient information about Lig. This is a case where the model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't verify
        one location's existence.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model says "NO" at the end, it immediately
        clarifies that this is because it "cannot verify" or "cannot confirm" the
        existence/location of Lig. This makes it a case of being unable to determine
        the comparison, rather than a definitive comparative NO. This falls under
        the UNKNOWN criteria where "The model indicates it cannot make the comparison."
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    366e7b13-7145-485a-8b61-98a1975f8aac:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, even if we had classified the final
        answer as NO, the model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated
        it couldn't verify one location at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (I cannot confirm
        that Lig is located east of Leknes)". Since this NO is qualified with an inability
        to verify/determine the comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than a comparative NO. The model consistently expresses throughout its reasoning
        that it cannot make the comparison due to being unable to verify Lig's existence
        or location.

        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" due to lack of information about one of the locations. This
        is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient

        never reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't establish
        the location of one of the places.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot determine the location relationship
        because it cannot confirm the existence or location of one of the places (Lig).
        This falls under the UNKNOWN classification as the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot confirm that Lig is
        east of Leknes because I cannot verify Lig's existence or location." This
        is a case where the model indicates it cannot determine/verify the comparison,

        explicitly states a directional difference ("Horsehay sits to the west of
        Mitcheldean"). Earlier mentions of similar longitudes were later revised in
        the final conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" in its final
        step-by-step analysis, stating definitively that "Horsehay sits to the west
        of Mitcheldean, not to the east."

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference - that Horsehay is northwest of Mitcheldean. Even
        though this might be a small difference, any stated directional difference
        means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer, stating that "Horsehay is not positioned to the east
        of Mitcheldean" and that it is instead northwest of Mitcheldean.

        its reasoning process, its final NO answer is based on determining that Horsehay
        is "positioned more to the left (west) and up (north) from Mitcheldean." The
        model does not state the locations are equal or the same - it specifically
        identifies a directional difference (northwest position), making this a NO
        based on difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Horsehay is not east of Mitcheldean. This is
        a direct comparative answer without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.

        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Sahiwal District is west of Bhivpuri, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO is based on the opposite direction
        being true (west instead of east), not on equality.

        locations are different - specifically that Sahiwal District is to the west
        of Bhivpuri. The model does not state or suggest that the locations are at
        the same position. Rather, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes that Sahiwal District is west of Bhivpuri, not east.

        locations are in different positions (Sahiwal is west of Bhivpuri), not because
        they are in the same location. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations, with Sahiwal being west of Bhivpuri.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Sahiwal District is not located east of Bhivpuri
        (it's west instead). This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it does not
        state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states
        there is a directional difference - that Sahiwal District is to the west of
        Bhivpuri. This directional difference, not equality, is given as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer, indicating that Sahiwal District is not east of
        Bhivpuri. The model is confident in this comparative result and provides directional
        reasoning (stating it is west, not east).

        difference between their locations. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative statement that "Boone County is
        located to the west of Antelope County in Nebraska, not to the east." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        times, including as its final conclusion, indicating that Scole is not east
        of Clacton-on-Sea. The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Scole being west of Clacton-on-Sea), not because the locations are at the
        same longitude. The model explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        with Clacton-on-Sea being on the coast and Scole being inland to the west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer, stating that Scole must be west of Clacton-on-Sea, not
        east of it.

        locations are equal. The model explicitly states that Clacton-on-Sea is further
        east than Scole, describing a clear directional difference between their positions
        (with Clacton being "further east" and Scole being "west of coastal areas
        like Clacton").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, concluding that Scole is not east of Clacton-on-Sea. The answer is
        definitive and comparative, not indicating uncertainty or refusal.
