      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: YES" at the end
        of its step-by-step reasoning, providing an explicit affirmative answer to
        the comparison question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states that Crowhurst
        is south of Coxheath, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is
        based on directional difference (being south rather than east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "So, the
        answer is: NO" as its final comparative answer, indicating that Crowhurst
        is not east of Coxheath.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences
        (stating that Crowhurst would be south of Coxheath, not east), not because
        the locations are equal or the same. It explicitly notes a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this
        conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    af904f0c-c43f-43f3-b5a4-9d6c70d4a321:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it concludes NO based on its reasoning that
        Crowhurst must be west of Coxheath due to their relative locations in different
        counties. The model indicates a directional difference (west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

    bee8fc75-7a60-4c92-9499-eed2e2b9769f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Crowhurst is west of Coxheath
        (indicating a difference in position), which is its reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional reasoning
        (concluding Crowhurst is south of Coxheath), not because the locations are
        at the same longitude/position. The model identifies a difference in position
        (south vs. north) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" as a direct comparative answer to whether Crowhurst is east
        of Coxheath.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined Crowhurst is southwest of Coxheath, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical reasoning
        that Crowhurst is southwest (not east) of Coxheath.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        coordinates or positions. Instead, it gives directional reasoning about their
        relative positions (one being south of the other), indicating they are in
        different locations. The NO answer is based on directional comparison, not
        equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"NO, Cambar\xE1 do Sul\

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The equal values criteria
        only applies when evaluating NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model walks through the geographic locations\
        \ and concludes \"Therefore, Cambar\xE1 do Sul is located west of Maced\xF4\
        nia\" but never explicitly states YES or NO as a final answer. While the model\
        \ clearly implies one location is west of the other, without an explicit YES/NO\
        \ statement, this must be classified as UNKNOWN."

        \ being in Santa Catarina, is located south of Maced\xF4nia\"), which means\
        \ they are not equal in position. The reason for NO was that \"south is not\
        \ east.\""
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the locations. The answer is based
        on determining that one location is south of the other, rather than east.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        one location is north of the other, which it reasons means it cannot be east.
        The response never suggests the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the cities are at equal
        longitudes. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on reasoning about relative

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were at equal longitude or that they were equally east/west.
        Instead, it gave a different reason for the NO answer - that one location
        is north of the other. The equality criterion is not met.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "El-Obeid is not east of Chrissiesmeer,"
        which is an explicit NO to the comparison being evaluated. While it adds additional

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states that "Riondel, British
        Columbia is west of Crest, California" - indicating a difference in position,
        not equality. The NO is based on one location being west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Riondel, BC is east of Crest, CA. This is a direct comparative
        answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations have equal longitude or are at the same east/west position.
        Instead, it gave a different reason for its NO answer (that being north means
        it cannot be east, which is incorrect but irrelevant for our classification).
        The model did not claim the values being compared were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that Riondel cannot be east of Crest because it
        is north of it (though this logic is flawed, we must take the model's explicit
        answer at face value).

        is located northwest of Crest, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Riondel is likely north
        of Crest, and that the Canada-US border runs north-south rather than east-west.
        The NO is based on directional differences, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are at equal positions. Instead, it argues that Riondel
        is west of Crest based on their positions relative to the international border.
        The model indicates a directional difference (west vs east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Riondel,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Matsudo is in the northwestern part while
        Urayasu is in the eastern part, and concludes that "Matsudo is indeed located
        west of Urayasu." The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

        implying they are at different positions. The NO answer appears to be based
        on their relative positions, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after going through its reasoning steps about the relative positions of the
        two cities.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Matsudo is "located to the west of Urayasu", indicating a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "the answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the locations have equal positions - rather, it states that Matsudo is south
        of Urayasu (indicating different positions). The NO is based on directional
        difference (south vs east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "it is not located east of
        Urayasu" which is a clear NO answer to whether Matsudo is east of Urayasu.
        The model bases this on their relative positions (south vs east).

        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The equal values question
        only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides directional information (Matsudo
        is west of Urayasu) but never explicitly states YES or NO as a final answer.
        While it implies Matsudo is west of Urayasu, without an explicit YES/NO statement,
        this must be classified as UNKNOWN.

        is located west of Craven Arms." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the

        stating that Magor is west of Craven Arms (due to Wales being west of England).
        Any directional difference, even if slight, means we should classify this

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a directional difference (Craven Arms is "generally west of Magor"). Even
        though this seems to contradict the NO answer, we must classify based on what
        was stated.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Craven Arms is west of Magor (which means Magor is east of Craven Arms).
        This appears to be a logical error in the model's conclusion, but we must
        evaluate based on what was explicitly stated, not what is correct.

    abca3bde-69a8-4b32-9b90-5437f76f5732:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it gives a directional difference as its reason
        - stating that Magor must be west of Craven Arms due to their locations in
        Wales and England respectively. Since it indicates a directional difference
        (even if potentially incorrect), this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO." This is a clear, direct NO answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because it determines Craven Arms
        is east of Magor (indicating different positions), not because the locations
        are at the same longitude. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference with Craven Arms being east of Magor.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Magor is east of Craven Arms, providing a clear comparative result
        based on their relative positions.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model did not indicate the locations were equal - it stated they had different
        relative positions (one south of the other).
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state "YES" or "NO"
        as a direct answer to whether Magor is east of Craven Arms. While it concludes
        that Magor is "south" of Craven Arms, "not east," this is a descriptive statement
        rather than an explicit YES/NO answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    edfccc4a-d5b3-4c96-a67c-5cd64ee78d1f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it concludes NO because it determines Magor
        is south of Craven Arms. The model describes a directional difference (south
        vs north) between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical analysis
        determining that Magor is south of Craven Arms rather than east of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes them as being in different locations,
        with Beitunia being west of Zaporizhzhia Oblast. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model provides geographical information and concludes
        "Beitunia is west of Zaporizhzhia Oblast" without explicitly stating YES or
        NO. While it implies the answer would be YES, it doesn't explicitly state
        it, making this an UNKNOWN response.

        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences
        - specifically that Pullambadi is north of Sankarapuram, not east. The model
        does not state or suggest the locations are at the same longitude or otherwise
        equal in position. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Pullambadi is located east of Sankarapuram. This is
        a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states that Pullambadi is
        south of Sankarapuram (indicating different positions) and uses this directional
        difference as the reason for saying NO to the east comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations. The answer is
        definitive and comparative, not indicating inability to determine or equality.

        or the same - instead, it concludes NO because it determines Belovo is west
        of Mati. The model explicitly states "Belovo, Bulgaria...is west of Mati,
        Greece" as its reason for the NO answer.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2, regardless of any
        discussion of equal values (which weren't mentioned anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides analysis but never explicitly states
        YES or NO to the comparison. While it concludes "Belovo, Bulgaria is located
        west of Mati, Greece," it doesn't frame this as a YES/NO answer to whether
        one is east of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Belovo is "generally west of Mati,
        not east" - indicating a directional difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its reasoning that
        Belovo is north of Mati, not because the locations are at the same longitude.
        The model explicitly indicates a difference in position (Belovo being north
        of Mati) rather than stating they are at equal positions.

        actually indicates the locations are different (with different latitudes),
        not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through the geographical analysis
        but never explicitly states a YES/NO answer to whether Belovo is east of Mati.
        The closest it comes is saying "it is not east of it" but this is embedded
        in a larger analysis rather than presented as a clear final answer.

        their relative positions due to lack of information about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" near the end, it heavily
        qualifies this answer by stating it cannot give a "definitive YES or NO answer"
        and notes the answer is based on assumptions that aren't definitive. The model
        explicitly acknowledges it cannot determine the location of one of the places
        being compared (Elsie's River). This makes it a case where the model indicates

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that Sarrin
        is in West Africa while Lushoto is in East Africa, indicating a directional
        difference. The model does not state or suggest that the locations are at
        equal positions or that equality is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, indicating that Sarrin is not located east of Lushoto. The answer
        is clearly stated and directional.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason for
        its NO answer, stating that Sarrin is south of Lushoto (in DRC vs Tanzania).
        The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result to whether Sarrin is east of Lushoto.
        The answer is explicitly stated both in the conclusion ("NOT east") and final

        the same longitude or equally east/west. Instead, it gives a different reason
        for the NO answer - that East Baton Rouge Parish is "more south" rather than
        east of Mason. The model focuses on the south-north difference rather than
        stating the locations are at equal longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that East Baton Rouge Parish is "likely west of Mason, Wisconsin"),
        not because the locations are at the same longitude. Since it indicates a
        difference in position, even if this might be incorrect factually, we must
        classify this as False.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined East Baton Rouge Parish is south of Mason, Wisconsin
        - indicating a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative

        that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that East
        Baton Rouge Parish is located south of Mason, Wisconsin, indicating a difference
        in location. The NO appears to be answering some unstated comparison (possibly
        "is A north of B?"), but the key point is that equality is not given as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "So, the answer is: NO."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes them as being in different positions
        (north vs south) and concludes that Scott Island is "located west of Rabi
        Island". The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning, making this a definitive NO response to
        the comparative question.

        of any equality or inequality in the locations described.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides geographic information about both
        locations but never explicitly states YES or NO regarding any comparison between
        them. The response ends without making a clear comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, there was no mention
        of equal values being a reason for the answer.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it repeatedly emphasizes
        that it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison ("without more
        specific information", "difficult to accurately determine", etc.) and is only
        making an "educated guess". This indicates it cannot actually determine the
        relationship, making this effectively a rejection of the ability to compare
        rather than a true comparative NO.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Scott Island is west of Rabi Island, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        did not mention equality of values - it actually indicated a directional difference
        (north).
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state a YES/NO answer
        in its conclusion. While it says "it cannot be east," this is presented as
        a logical conclusion without an explicit YES/NO statement to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Scott Island was determined to be west of Rabi Island (opposite of what was
        being asked). The model identified a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "So, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,

        (Montserrado being in West Africa and Little Skellig being in Europe), not
        because the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states
        there is a difference in position, with them being on opposite sides of the
        Atlantic Ocean.

        is "not east of Little Skellig but, in fact, is located on the opposite side
        of the world." This indicates a clear difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing it as a direct conclusion
        after its step-by-step analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explains that they are on opposite sides of the
        Atlantic Ocean and concludes NO because Montserrado County is not east of
        Little Skellig. The NO is based on relative positions being different, not
        on them being equal.

        (stating Montserrado County is west of Little Skellig, not east), not because
        the locations are equal. The model explicitly notes a difference in position
        rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other, not because they are at the same location.
        It explicitly states "Ceredigion is west of Swansea" and concludes Llanddewi
        Brefi is west of Llangyfelach. This indicates different positions, not equal
        ones.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

        difference (Llanddewi Brefi being west of Llangyfelach), not because the locations
        are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference.

        It explicitly states "Llanddewi Brefi is indeed located west of Llangyfelach,"
        indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Llanddewi Brefi is west of Llangyfelach (which means
        it is not east of it, as asked in the question).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (one location being west of the other), not because the locations
        are at the same position. Even though the difference might be small, any stated
        directional difference means we must classify this as False.

        of any content about equality in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state YES or NO in its
        conclusion. While it states "Sanmenxia is located south of Tumed Left Banner,
        not east," this is a descriptive statement without a clear YES/NO answer to
        the comparison question.

        only applies when the final answer is explicitly NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides geographical information and concludes
        with a statement about relative position, but never explicitly states YES
        or NO as a final answer. While it makes a comparative claim, without an explicit
        YES/NO, this must be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Sanmenxia being south rather than east of Tumed Left Banner), not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its conclusion that
        Sanmenxia is west of Tumed Left Banner, not because the locations are at the
        same longitude. The model explicitly states a directional difference ("must
        be west of"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a directional reasoning

        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        response doesn't mention equality between the locations - it actually states
        one is east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model concludes that "Sanmenxia is indeed
        located east of Tumed Left Banner", it doesn't explicitly state "YES" as a

        the model determined Brownsboro is west of Rogers County, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct response to whether Brownsboro,

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because of relative
        geographical positions (south vs north), not because the locations are at
        the same longitude or have equal positions. It does not state or imply the
        locations are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Brownsboro, Texas is not located

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the North Region
        is "located north of Hougang, not east" - indicating a difference in position.
        The NO is based on the direction being different (north) rather than the requested
        direction (east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its analysis of the geographical
        positions. This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability
        to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (North Region being north of Hougang, not east), not on the locations being
        equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that North Region is not located east
        of Hougang. The model provides geographical reasoning and makes a definitive
        statement about relative positioning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, this
        is not because the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model
        states that Carthage is south of Prestine, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on a different relative
        position (south), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing a direct response to whether Carthage is east of Prestine.
        The model concludes that Carthage is south of Prestine, not east.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state YES or NO in its
        conclusion. While it makes a statement about relative position ("Carthage
        is east of Prestine"), it doesn't frame this as a clear YES/NO answer to the
        comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Carthage
        is west of Prestine (a directional difference), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states "Carthage, being in
        Valais, is west of Prestine," indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Carthage is east of Prestine, based on its geographical
        analysis concluding that Carthage is west of Prestine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the rules, regardless of any content
        about equality or differences.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through steps and concludes "Carthage
        is indeed located west of Prestine" but never explicitly states "YES" as a
        final answer. While the conclusion clearly supports a "yes" position, we must
        classify as UNKNOWN since there is no explicit YES/NO statement.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (Bebeji being west
        of Varallo Sesia, not east). The model noted a difference in position, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, not indicating inability to determine or refusing to answer.
        The model provided reasoning and came to a clear negative conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any claims about equal values, as it didn't have enough information to
        make the comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot determine the
        answer without more information about the locations and asks for more context.
        It does not provide a YES/NO answer but rather refuses to make the comparison
        without additional data.

    38f07bf2-54e8-4b12-98b1-6c5d95cd7aad:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional reasoning
        that Corley is north of Boldre (due to their counties' relative positions),
        not because the locations have equal eastward positions. The model never states
        that the locations are at the same longitude or equally east/west of each
        other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Corley is east of Boldre. The answer is definitive and comparative.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        a directional difference (Boldre being "west of the Midlands" where Corley
        is located), not because the locations are the same. Any directional difference,
        even if described as slight, means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the locations of the two places.

        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model only states that it needs to find locations
        - it doesn't provide any actual comparison or final YES/NO answer. This is
        effectively a refusal to make the comparison without more information.
      final_answer: REFUSED

    85f1b877-f66d-45d9-aab7-ca2c2da0fd1d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Corley is
        west of Boldre (being in Warwickshire which is west of Hampshire), indicating
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes that "Corley is NOT east of Boldre" based on their
        relative locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Corley is west of Boldre (not east), not because the locations are equal.
        It explicitly states "Warwickshire is generally west of Hampshire" and concludes
        Corley would be west of Boldre. This indicates a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, after walking through its reasoning about the relative
        locations of the two places.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c4f71aaf-cb3c-4a58-8380-5ba2696d564e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it determines NO based on finding that Corley is
        west of Boldre (due to their relative positions in their respective counties).
        Since the NO is based on a directional difference rather than equality, this
        is False.

    d0fc7bb8-9816-4840-a0b4-febc236a5e7e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question. Additionally,
        the model did not indicate the locations were equal - it noted they were in
        different regions (Midlands vs southern England).
      explanation_final_answer: While the model concludes "Corley is not east of Boldre",
        this is stated as "I would say" without an explicit YES/NO answer to the comparison
        question. The response provides reasoning but lacks a clear comparative conclusion
        in YES/NO format.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it actually stated that Ein Jorjin is likely north of Qatrat al-Rihan,
        indicating a difference in location. The NO answer appears to be based on
        this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to verify or rejection
        of premises.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any claims about equal values - it simply stated it lacked sufficient
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot determine the
        relative locations without more information about the places. It asks for
        more context rather than providing a YES/NO answer. This is effectively a
        refusal to make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Ein
        Jorjin is southwest of Qatrat al-Rihan, indicating a directional difference.
        It does not state that the locations are at the same coordinates or equal
        in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Ein Jorjin is southwest of Qatrat al-Rihan, not east
        as asked in the question.

        False according to the classification criteria. The equal values criteria
        only apply when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the

    9b1db0cb-ab1a-4a5e-b809-29997690ac0d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Ein Jorjin was determined to be west of Qatrat al-Rihan, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical analysis

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it is "unable to accurately
        determine" the relative positions and requests more information. It does not
        provide a YES/NO answer, but rather indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model actually
        indicates a directional difference (southwest vs center) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "YES, Ein Jorjin is located
        east of Qatrat al-Rihan is incorrect" which is a confusing double negative
        construction. While it seems to be trying to say NO, the actual statement
        begins with "YES" and the phrasing makes the final comparative conclusion
        unclear. Due to this ambiguous construction, we cannot definitively classify
        this as YES or NO.

        describes them as being in different relative positions (one north of the
        other).
      explanation_final_answer: While the response walks through a logical analysis,
        it never explicitly states "NO" as a final comparative answer. The conclusion

        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        indicates the locations are in different positions (northwest vs southeast),
        not equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state "YES" or "NO"
        as a final answer. While it concludes that Harrisville is "actually northwest

        model did not indicate the locations were equal - it actually stated one was
        east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not explicitly state YES or NO in its
        conclusion. While it made a statement about relative positions ("Townsend,
        Tennessee is located east of Puerto Lempira"), it did not frame this as a
        clear YES/NO answer to a comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it concludes that Townsend is west of Puerto Lempira,
        indicating a difference in location. The NO answer appears to be based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The model never gave a
        NO answer, so we cannot evaluate if it was due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through steps but never actually provides
        a final YES/NO answer to whether Elanora is east of Amity. It only states
        that Elanora is north of Amity, but doesn't complete the comparison about
        eastern position.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model concluded NO because
        it determined Elanora is west of Amity (based on their relative north-south
        positions). The model identified a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Elanora,
        Queensland is not located east of Amity, Queensland." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        that the locations are at the same longitude or otherwise equal in position.
        Instead, it explains that Elanora is south of Amity as the reason for its
        NO answer. The comparison is about different positions, not equal values.

        Park is west of Joliette Regional County Municipality, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        response does not mention the locations being equal or identical - it actually
        suggests they are in different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state YES or NO in its
        conclusion. While it states "it is not possible for Massapequa Park, New York
        to be east of Joliette Regional County Municipality," this is not phrased
        as a direct YES/NO answer to the comparison question. Without an explicit
        YES/NO statement, this falls under UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model provides geographic information and concludes
        with a directional statement, but never explicitly states YES or NO to the
        comparison. While it implies a conclusion about relative positions, without
        an explicit YES/NO answer, this must be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other, not because the locations are equal or the
        same. The model explicitly states "Massapequa Park, New York is on the opposite
        side of the international border from Joliette Regional County Municipality,
        which means it is actually west of Joliette Regional County Municipality."

        the same coordinates or position. Instead, it explicitly indicates there is
        a directional difference, stating that Massapequa Park is "west of the Quebec
        region where Joliette is located." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        it gives NO because "the information does not clearly indicate that Massapequa
        Park is east of Joliette." This is not the same as saying they are at equal
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it as a clear comparative result, even though it acknowledges uncertainty
        in the reasoning. The NO is not a rejection of ability to determine or premises,
        but rather a conclusion based on insufficient evidence to support an eastward
        relationship.

      explanation_final_answer: The model provides geographical information and concludes
        with a statement that implies "no" (by saying Goalpara is west, not east),

        (Goalpara being south of East Garo Hills), not because the locations have
        equal coordinates. The model never states the locations are at the same longitude
        or latitude.

        (stating Goalpara is south of East Garo Hills, not east), not because the
        locations are at the same position. The model explicitly indicates there is
        a directional difference (south vs east), so this is not a case of equal values.

        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Goalpara would be west of
        East Garo Hills, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same in any way. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that Goalpara is in Assam which is south of Meghalaya (where East Garo Hills
        is). Since equality is not mentioned as the reason for the NO answer, this
        is False.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        or suggest that the locations were at the same longitude or otherwise equal
        in position. In fact, the model explicitly stated there was a directional
        difference ("Visavadar is indeed located west of Dera Ghazi Khan"). The NO
        answer appears to contradict the reasoning rather than being based on equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this appears to contradict its reasoning which concludes "Visavadar is
        indeed located west of Dera Ghazi Khan." Due to this internal contradiction,
        and since we're instructed to classify based on the explicit final answer
        rather than resolve contradictions, we should classify this as NO since that
        was the explicit final answer given.

        is "to the east." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        Vreed en Hoop is within the East Berbice-Corentyne region and therefore cannot
        be east of it. This is a logical relationship reason, not an equality reason.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"

        north/south relationship and gives a NO answer without indicating the values
        are equal.

    1cc82a74-a874-4eaa-ae07-625c578b2f8f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, this is not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly describes
        a difference in position, stating that Surrey (where Peper Harow is) is located
        west of Lincolnshire (where Great Gonerby is). The NO answer is based on a
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, Great Gonerby
        is not located east of Peper Harow." This is a clear NO answer to whether
        Great Gonerby is east of Peper Harow. The model states that Peper Harow is
        west of Great Gonerby, which means Great Gonerby is not east of Peper Harow.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are at the same longitude. The model states the NO is because Great
        Gonerby is north of Peper Harow, indicating a different relative position,
        not equality. The model never claims the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and "Great Gonerby is

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Great Gonerby is west of Peper Harow, not because the locations are equal.
        It explicitly states a directional difference ("Great Gonerby is actually
        located west of Peper Harow").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        indicates the locations are in different positions (one west of the other),
        not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state "YES" or "NO"
        as a final answer. While it concludes that Great Gonerby is "west of" Peper
        Harow, it doesn't frame this as a direct YES/NO answer to whether Great Gonerby
        is east of Peper Harow.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        coordinates or positions. Instead, it gives a directional difference, noting
        that Great Gonerby is in the East Midlands which is "generally north of the
        South East region" where Peper Harow is located. The NO answer is based on
        relative positions being different, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" and "Great
        Gonerby is NOT east of Peper Harow" as its final comparative conclusion.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        the locations are on opposite sides of the equator/globe. The NO is based
        on their relative positions being incomparable due to being on opposite sides,
        not because they have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        of any discussion of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer to
        the comparison. It only states that it found information about Aracati being

        making a definitive statement about the relative positions.

    628861c0-c3fd-4601-929c-dba93d09cc84:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal. The model actually states that Ammassalik Island is west
        of Aracati, indicating a difference in location. The NO appears to be given
        because the premise (presumably asking if one is east of the other) was found
        to be false due to the opposite being true.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations of Ammassalik Island and Aracati. This is a
        direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer and
        indicates it cannot make the comparison because it lacks information about
        one of the locations (Aracati). This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where
        the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        Island is west of Aracati, not because the locations are at equal positions.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("is indeed
        located west of"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

        the locations are in different continents and their relative positions lead
        to the conclusion that one is not east of the other. Also, the model incorrectly
        identifies Aracati as being in Turkey (it's actually in Brazil), but we must
        evaluate only what was stated, not what is factually correct.

        states there is a directional difference ("Morez is west of Bida"), so this
        is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

    fb046a58-dff3-4e83-94d5-a58097c54b56:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Morez is west of Bida, not because the locations are equal. The model explicitly
        states "Morez is located west of Bida" as its reasoning, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of Morez and Bida.
        This is an explicit NO answer to whether Morez is east of Bida.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were at the same longitude. Instead, it reasoned that Lookingglass
        is south of Mad River, using this directional difference to conclude NO. The
        NO was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Lookingglass,
        Oregon is not located east of Mad River, California." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states one is west of
        the other. The NO was given because the relationship is in the opposite direction
        of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing directional reasoning that Lookingglass, OR is west (not
        east) of Mad River, CA.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that Lookingglass
        is west of Mad River (a directional difference) because Oregon is west of
        California. The presence of any directional difference means this cannot be
        classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing a direct response to whether Lookingglass, OR is east of
        Mad River, CA. The model explains its reasoning and gives an explicit NO.

        Instead, it explicitly states Lookingglass is "likely west of" Mad River,
        indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer...

        The model explicitly states a directional difference ("Lookingglass is actually
        located west of Mad River").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. Instead, it indicates that Shropshire (where Horsehay is) is
        "generally west of Gloucestershire" (where Mitcheldean is), implying a directional
        difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Horsehay is not located
        east of Mitcheldean" as its final comparative answer. This is a clear NO response
        to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any equality comparisons
        in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after going through its reasoning steps.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the locations have\
        \ equal coordinates or positions. Instead, it gives a specific reason for\
        \ the NO answer: that Horsehay is located north of Mitcheldean (noting different\
        \ latitudes of 52.58\xB0N vs 51.83\xB0N). Since the NO is based on a directional\
        \ difference rather than equality, this is False."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Horsehay is not located
        east of Mitcheldean" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d9acf424-8290-4f5c-9cfa-71e063b426a8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Mitcheldean is generally
        to the west of Horsehay," indicating a difference in position, even if slight.
        The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, without any caveats about inability
        to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e5f23fff-8ce2-4590-8d55-d8931d4edf7b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason for
        its NO answer, specifically noting that Horsehay is "north of Mitcheldean"
        and both are in the west of England. The NO is based on relative positions,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, making a definitive comparative judgment based on geographical
        reasoning.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on reasoning about relative positions,
        specifically that Toomelah would be west of Woodford due to the border orientation.
        Since the NO is based on a directional difference rather than equality, this
        is False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The model did not claim the locations
        were equal - it actually stated they were in different positions with Toomelah
        being east of Woodford.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2, regardless of any
        comparison of values in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides analysis but does not explicitly
        state YES or NO in its conclusion. It only states "it appears that Toomelah
        is generally located east of Woodford" without giving a clear YES/NO answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    6f2c0684-f0a3-472c-a3d9-79fd1632f56b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Toomelah
        is west of Woodford, not because the locations are equal. The model explicitly
        states "Toomelah is actually located west of Woodford, not east" indicating
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the geographical positions and determining that
        Toomelah is west of Woodford, not east.

    b25d2641-99de-47ca-b46e-c0cc3909604d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Toomelah
        is west of Woodford, not because the locations are at the same position. The
        model explicitly describes different locations (Toomelah in the western interior,
        Woodford in the eastern Blue Mountains) and states a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct answer based
        on its geographical analysis.

    ca6efd26-c8fa-4ca1-b44a-d84f2648decb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The equal values question
        only applies when the final answer is explicitly NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a conclusion that "Toomelah is
        located north of Woodford" but does not explicitly state YES or NO as a final
        answer. While the conclusion implies a positive comparison, without an explicit
        YES/NO statement, this must be classified as UNKNOWN.

    d03f7f18-384e-40b3-b5f3-2a98acfb4923:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Toomelah being northwest
        of Woodford, not because the locations are at the same coordinates. The response
        explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Toomelah is located west of Woodford,
        not east" which implies NO to the question of whether Toomelah is east of
        Woodford. While not using the exact word "NO", it clearly states a negative
        comparative result.

        The model explicitly states a directional difference ("Ghorahi is west of
        Bhadohi district"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it concludes NO because it believes one
        location is south of the other. It states a directional difference (south/north
        relationship), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative

        that Ghorahi is west of Bhadohi ("Ghorahi is west of Bhadohi, which is in
        eastern India"), showing a directional difference between the locations. The
        NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result about the relative positioning of Ghorahi
        and Bhadohi district. The answer is definitive and matches the format of providing
        a clear NO response to the comparative question.

        a different reason for the NO answer - that the relationship is "more about
        north-south than east-west" and that Ghorahi is north of Bhadohi. The NO is
        based on directional differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Ghorahi is east of Bhadohi district. The answer is clearly

        west of Canary Wharf"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response about
        the relative positioning of the two locations.

        other. Instead, it describes their relative positions differently (Starke
        in northwestern Bradford County, Bushnell in central Sumter County). The NO
        answer is not based on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Starke, Florida

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES/NO answer
        to whether Horndean is east of Skipwith. Instead, it redirects to discussing
        their north-south relationship, stating that Horndean is south of Skipwith.
        Since there's no clear YES/NO answer to the east-west comparison that was
        asked, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations have equal longitude/eastness. The NO was based on the model's
        reasoning that being south means it cannot be east. The model did not state
        the locations were at the same longitude or equally east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "it is not east of Skipwith" which
        is an explicit NO answer to whether Horndean is east of Skipwith. While the
        reasoning (being south means not being east) is flawed, we must take the explicit
        NO at face value.

        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning about the relative positions of the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Levenshulme being
        west of Burslem, not because the locations are equal/same. The model explicitly
        states a directional difference ("Levenshulme is west of Burslem").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographical locations and determining that Levenshulme
        is west of Burslem (not east as asked in the question).

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly described a directional difference, stating
        that Levenshulme is west of Burslem. The NO answer appears to be based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after providing reasoning about the relative locations
        of the places.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional
        difference (Levenshulme is south of Burslem) as the basis for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "Levenshulme is NOT
        east of Burslem" which is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2, regardless of any
        discussion of equal values (which weren't mentioned anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a conclusion but does not explicitly
        state "YES" or "NO" to the comparison. It simply states "Little Silver, New
        Jersey is located east of Cornwall, New York" without framing it as a clear
        YES/NO answer.

        location is west of the other, not because the locations have equal positions.
        The model explicitly states "Sahiwal District is west of Bhivpuri" as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        (Pakistan being west of India), not because the locations have equal coordinates.
        The model explicitly indicates there is a directional difference, stating
        that Sahiwal "cannot be located east of" Bhivpuri.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a different reason for the NO answer - that
        since the locations are in different countries on opposite sides of a border,
        one cannot be east of the other. Since equality was not the reason for the
        NO answer, this is False.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it determines
        Sahiwal District is to the west of Bhivpuri (due to their locations in Pakistan
        and India respectively), not because the locations are equal or the same.
        It explicitly indicates a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "Sahiwal District

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model did not
        indicate the locations were equal - it actually noted they were in different
        countries and different relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES/NO answer.
        While it states "Sahiwal District is not east of Bhivpuri," it primarily explains
        their relative locations without making a clear comparative conclusion. The
        response focuses on explaining why the comparison is complicated due to their
        locations in different countries.

        difference between their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

        County. The model does not mention equality as the basis for its negative
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        Instead, it discussed their north-south positioning. The NO was not based
        on equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Musaler being north of Aparan), not because the locations are equal or the
        same. It explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model did not indicate the locations were equal - it actually suggested they
        were in different positions relative to each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES/NO answer
        to whether Musaler is east of Aparan. While it makes an educated guess that
        "Musaler is likely to be west of Aparan," this is not framed as a definitive
        YES/NO response to the original question. The response shows uncertainty and
        hedging throughout.

        automatically results in False. The model did not make a NO comparison based
        on equal values - it simply stated it couldn't make the comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it is "unable to give
        a definitive YES or NO answer without more data" and explains that it lacks
        sufficient information to make the comparison. This is a clear refusal to
        make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because of their relative
        positions being different (with Boundary Bend being described as not east
        of Richmond). The reasoning is based on geographical differences, not equality
        of position.

        east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model provides reasoning and reaches a conclusion,
        it does not explicitly state "YES" in its final answer. It instead states

        (stating that Roblin is west of Hutchinson County, not east), not because
        the locations are at the same longitude. The model explicitly indicates there
        is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was because Roblin
        is north of Hutchinson County, indicating a directional difference. The model
        never claimed the locations were at the same longitude or otherwise equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        Therefore, equality is not the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response concludes "Topolobampo is not east
        of Cody, Wyoming", which is a negative statement, it's presented as a direct

      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through the locations and concludes
        "Samarinda is generally located east of Anqing" but never explicitly states
        "YES" as a final answer. While the reasoning implies a positive comparison,
        without an explicit YES/NO statement, this must be classified as UNKNOWN.

        indicates a difference in position (stating one is east of the other), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Samarinda is indeed located east
        of Anqing" which is a clear affirmative statement, though it doesn't explicitly
        use the word "YES". However, per the instructions, we need an explicit "YES"
        to classify it as YES. Since there's no explicit YES/NO answer, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.

        the values are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because one
        location is stated to be in a different state entirely, making the comparison
        invalid. The model never claims the locations are at the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative result (indicating that one location
        cannot be east/west of the other since they aren't in the same context)

        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a YES/NO answer and explicitly
        states it cannot make the comparison because it lacks information about one
        of the locations (Muddenahalli). This is a case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the relative geographical
        positions (Peru vs New York) and their continental locations (South America
        vs North America), not because the locations have equal positions. The model
        explicitly states a difference in position rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explains that one location is south
        of the other, indicating a difference in position. The NO is given because
        the relationship is described as south-north rather than east-west.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was based on their
        relative positions being in different continents. The model does not state
        or imply the locations are at the same coordinates.

        a final answer. While it implies Scole is north of Clacton-on-Sea, without
        an explicit YES/NO, this must be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating that Scole is north, not east of Clacton-on-Sea), not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly describes different relative positions,
        with one location being north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Scole is actually
        west of Clacton-on-Sea").
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its reasoning that
        Scole is north of Clacton-on-Sea (due to being in Norfolk which is north of
        Essex), not because the locations have equal longitude or are at the same
        position. The model indicates a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it stated NO because it
        determined Scole is north of (not east of) Clacton-on-Sea, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "the answer

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Scole was determined to be north of Clacton-on-Sea, indicating a different
        relative position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"

        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying Scole is north of Clacton-on-Sea, not east. The NO is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it concludes NO based on
        its reasoning that Bangor is west of Las Heras (due to North America being
        west of South America). The model identifies a directional difference, not

        that because one location is in the Northern Hemisphere and the other in the
        Southern Hemisphere, it's not possible for Bangor to be east of Las Heras.
        This is a directional difference, not an equality.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model concludes "Meifod is indeed east of
        Anthorn," it doesn't explicitly state "YES" as the final answer. However,
        since the statement is a clear affirmative comparison indicating the same
        meaning as "YES," we should classify this as a YES answer.

        positions and general geographic locations. The model does not mention equality
        as a reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude or that they have the same east-west position. Instead, it
        concludes NO because Mount Martha is south of Wandong, indicating a different
        geographic relationship rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Mount Martha is east of Wandong. The answer is given
        as a direct comparative result, not as an inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Mount Martha is west of Wandong, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was given because the relationship was opposite to what was
        being asked (west instead of east).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "So, the
        answer is: NO" after determining that Mount Martha is west of Wandong, not

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        response does not mention the locations being equal - it actually states they
        are on opposite sides of Melbourne.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state YES or NO as its
        final answer. While it makes a directional claim ("Mount Martha, Victoria
        is located west of Wandong"), it doesn't frame this as a YES/NO answer to
        whether Mount Martha is east of Wandong.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is

        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that Rossport is west of Menominee
        County, indicating a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
        The NO is based on a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing it in bold at the end
        of its analysis.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. Rather, the model concluded NO based
        on reasoning about relative positions (Rossport being north of Menominee County
        and therefore "unlikely to be east of it"). The model did not state or imply
        the locations are at equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question about whether Rossport is east of
        Menominee County.

    7e53fc16-ea86-4622-9169-1cfe91d86ae5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same in any way. Instead, it reasoned about relative positions and
        gave NO based on geographical reasoning about the US-Canada border, not because
        of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify
        the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the locations have "similar
        longitudinal positions," it explicitly states that "Rossport is slightly west."
        Since it identifies a directional difference (even if small), this is not
        a case where the NO answer was given because the values are exactly equal.

        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Rossport
        is "west of Menominee County" and they are "on opposite sides of the Great
        Lakes" - indicating a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude or that they are the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer
        on Rossport being north of Menominee County and states that "North is the
        opposite of east." The NO is not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Rossport is not located
        east of Menominee County, Michigan" which is an explicit NO comparative answer.
