        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that it "cannot conclusively say
        if Barwala is located east of Nalwa" due to insufficient information about
        Nalwa's precise location. The NO answer is based on lack of information to
        make the determination, not on the locations being equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its boxed conclusion

        bank of the Demerara River while East Berbice-Corentyne is in the eastern
        part of Guyana. The model concludes that Vreed en Hoop "cannot be located

        "East Berbice-Corentyne, as the name suggests, is an administrative region

        Martha is located east of Wandong is: NO" at the end of its response. This

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Mount Martha is southeast
        of Wandong rather than directly east, indicating a directional difference.
        The model notes that Mount Martha is "not directly east but rather southeast
        of Wandong," which is giving a reason based on directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Mount Martha is located east of Wandong. The answer is clearly
        stated at the end of the response.
