      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Crowhurst
        is southwest of Coxheath, indicating a directional difference. It does not
        state or suggest the locations are at equal positions - in fact, it explicitly
        notes a directional difference. The NO is based on the direction being different
        from what was asked, not based on equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Crowhurst is southwest of Coxheath, not east of it. This is a direct
        comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    34589283-6519-491b-9898-3e4cc7c370c3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Crowhurst
        is southwest of Coxheath, indicating a directional difference between the
        locations. The NO is not due to the locations being equal or the same - it's
        because they have different relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, stating that Crowhurst is not east of Coxheath
        (because it determined Crowhurst is southwest of Coxheath).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any equality comparisons
        in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered NO but then explicitly
        reconsidered and gave a final answer of YES, making its final determination
        clear.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    4e29ffac-1326-4131-920d-f746fb3cd642:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Crowhurst was determined to be southwest of Coxheath, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after explaining that Crowhurst is southwest of Coxheath, therefore
        not east of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a directional difference, concluding that "Crowhurst is indeed west of
        Coxheath."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations, determining
        that Crowhurst is west of Coxheath.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    53ff52e2-f9be-4fb6-aebe-a9525322c13c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same
        - instead, it explicitly states Crowhurst is "south and slightly west of Coxheath"
        and "to the southwest of Coxheath," indicating a directional difference as
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        and explicitly states "Crowhurst is NOT east of Coxheath," providing a definitive
        comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    621914fb-de3e-4d1c-84d3-73b17fe62704:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that Crowhurst
        is west of Coxheath, indicating a difference in position, and this directional
        difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explains that Crowhurst
        is west of Coxheath, not east of it. This is a direct comparative answer to
        the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8278cb5b-5414-4d33-974a-056d453996b0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in
        position, saying "Coxheath is located further east than Crowhurst" and that
        "Crowhurst is in western East Sussex, while Coxheath is in Kent, which is
        to the east." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly
        states "Crowhurst is NOT east of Coxheath." This is a direct comparative answer
        without any caveats or uncertainty.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    84e0f22d-7431-4480-bfbe-fc7453dcf098:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states that Crowhurst is southwest
        of Coxheath, indicating a directional difference between their positions.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Crowhurst is southwest of Coxheath, not east. This is a direct comparative
        answer to the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    974dbc94-a679-4c08-a301-b605661c0bd5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Coxheath is northeast of Crowhurst, and Crowhurst is west/southwest
        of Coxheath), not because the locations are at the same position. The model
        explicitly notes a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after explaining
        that Crowhurst cannot be east of Coxheath because Coxheath is northeast of
        Crowhurst.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    0659450e-dea9-4e1f-bd31-35b8fdc2b6ed:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The specific reasoning about equality
        vs difference becomes irrelevant when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: Although the model initially said NO, it then explicitly
        corrected itself and concluded with YES as its final answer. We should take
        the final stated answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

    20ce58ec-a39f-4972-a061-f26ef0ab1e04:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not
        relevant to evaluate since we only assess that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model initially gave a NO answer but then explicitly\

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly concluded with \"YES\" at the\

        While it mentions there might be a "very slight" difference, this is presented
        as uncertainty rather than an observed difference, and the conclusion emphasizes
        they are "at approximately the same longitude" as the reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it determines
        that Sattenapalle is more easterly than Puranpur, not because the locations
        are at the same longitude. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position ("Sattenapalle (in southeastern India) is more easterly than Puranpur").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly
        states that "Puranpur is NOT east of Sattenapalle." This is a direct comparative
        answer to the question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are at different positions (with Puranpur being west of Sattenapalle),
        not because they are at the same location. The model never states or suggests
        the locations are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Puranpur is west of Sattenapalle (not east as asked in the question).
        This is a direct comparative answer to the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    856f4334-422b-4ca8-afb0-6c55f8b1efe4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that "Sattenapalle is
        positioned more to the east than Puranpur" and "Sattenapalle is east of Puranpur,"
        indicating a clear difference in their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Puranpur is not east of Sattenapalle. The model
        provides a direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were at equal positions. Instead, it explicitly stated
        that Puranpur is west of Sattenapalle, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO was based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes "NO, Puranpur is not
        located east of Sattenapalle" and provides a clear directional statement that
        "Puranpur is actually west of Sattenapalle."

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Puranpur is
        west of Sattenapalle, indicating a difference in position. The NO is based
        on Puranpur being west of (not equal to) Sattenapalle.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations, concluding that
        Puranpur is NOT east of Sattenapalle.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states that Sattenapalle is further
        east and Puranpur is west of Sattenapalle, indicating a clear difference in
        position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after analyzing
        the locations and explicitly states "Puranpur is NOT east of Sattenapalle."
        This is a direct comparative answer.

    be03f714-d0d1-417b-aa59-cf919d6b27e2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they are "roughly at the same
        longitude," it immediately qualifies this by stating "with Puranpur possibly
        slightly west of Sattenapalle." Since it indicates a directional difference
        (even if slight), this is not a case where equality is the primary reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Puranpur is not located
        east of Sattenapalle" and provides a clear comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations have equal positions. Instead, the model explicitly states that
        Puranpur is west of Sattenapalle, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO answer was given because the positions are different, not because they
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Puranpur is not located
        east of Sattenapalle" and further clarifies that "Puranpur is actually west
        of Sattenapalle." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

    fb2b4514-db0f-4566-91e4-b472111f63ec:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal/same - instead, it explicitly stated that Sattenapalle is east of Puranpur,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO was based on this directional
        difference, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that "Puranpur is NOT east of Sattenapalle." This is a direct
        comparative answer.

        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, saying "Confluence is further west." The model describes a directional
        difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO, Confluence,

        or the same - it explicitly states that Confluence, PA is west of Big Island,
        VA. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explains that Confluence,
        PA is NOT east of Big Island, VA (it's actually west of it). This is a direct
        comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the locations are "at approximately
        the same longitude," it also specifically states that "Zaporizhzhia Oblast
        possibly slightly further east." Since it indicates a slight difference rather
        than pure equality, and this tiny difference is part of the reasoning, this
        does not qualify as a NO due to exact equality.

        longitude falls within Zaporizhzhia Oblast's range, it does not state they
        are equal/identical/the same. Rather, it indicates that one region's range
        encompasses the other's position, which is a different relationship than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" twice, first
        based on a slight difference in coordinates, then reaffirming NO after revising
        its reasoning to note that Zaporizhzhia Oblast's range encompasses Beitunia's
        longitude.

        slightly west of parts of Zaporizhzhia Oblast." Since it indicates a directional
        difference (even if slight), this does not qualify as stating they are exactly
        equal as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Beitunia
        is not located east of Zaporizhzhia Oblast" as a clear comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal - it actually states that Beitunia is "approximately at the same
        longitude or slightly west" and concludes it's "to the southwest" of Zaporizhzhia
        Oblast. Since it indicates a directional difference (even if slight), this
        cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this
        conclusion.

        ranges showing they are not exactly equal. The NO answer is based on this
        slight westward position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final

        of the average longitude of Zaporizhzhia Oblast." Since it identifies a directional
        difference (even if small), this is not a case where the NO answer was given
        because the values are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        is northwest of Thondamuthur, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Kalaburagi district
        is not located east of Thondamuthur" and provides a definitive comparative
        result, indicating it is northwest instead.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - it explicitly states that Kalaburagi is west
        of Thondamuthur, indicating a difference in position. The NO is based on this
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations and determining
        that Kalaburagi is west of Thondamuthur, not east.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Kalaburagi
        is west of Thondamuthur, not because the locations are at the same position.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Kalaburagi
        would be northwest of Thondamuthur"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Kalaburagi is west (not east) of Thondamuthur. This is a direct comparative
        answer to the question.

    f9a35cc5-0693-4cf5-b5fa-e9d6f3209479:

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, with Kalaburagi being "to the west and
        slightly north of Thondamuthur." Any stated directional difference, even if
        described as slight, means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Kalaburagi district
        is not located east of Thondamuthur" and provides a clear directional statement
        that it is "located to the west and slightly north of Thondamuthur." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        states "Brownsboro, being in eastern Texas, is west of Rogers County" and
        concludes it is "located west of it." This indicates a difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Brownsboro, Texas is
        not located east of Rogers County, Oklahoma. It is located west of it." This

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, this is not because
        the locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Mandi
        Dabwali is west of Budgam, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about whether Mandi Dabwali
        is east of Budgam. The model also reinforces this with "Mandi Dabwali is NOT
        east of Budgam. In fact, it's west of Budgam."

        in position, concluding that "Budgam is located further west compared to Mandi
        Dabwali" and "Mandi Dabwali is therefore east of Budgam." The NO answer was
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the locations, indicating

        to insufficient location information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a reliable
        YES or NO answer" and concludes "NO definitive answer can be provided." This
        indicates an inability to make the comparison due to insufficient information,
        rather than a comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Ein
        Jorjin is west of Qatrat al-Rihan, not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Ein Jorjin is located to the west of Qatrat al-Rihan
        (not east as asked in the question).

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any discussion of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains it lacks sufficient information to determine
        the relative positions. This indicates inability to make the comparison rather
        than refusal or a clear YES/NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Ein
        Jorjin is west of Qatrat al-Rihan, not because the locations are equal. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations
        (one is "more western" than the other).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after explaining
        that Ein Jorjin is west of Qatrat al-Rihan, not east as asked in the question.
        This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        the same position. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a directional difference,
        noting that "Qatrat al-Rihan is located further east" than Ein Jorjin.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Qatrat al-Rihan is east of Ein Jorjin, making it impossible for Ein Jorjin
        to be east of Qatrat al-Rihan.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to lacking precise coordinate data. This indicates an
        inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal or clear YES/NO answer.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that Ein Jorjin is not east of Qatrat al-Rihan. This is a

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it stated that Ein Jorjin
        is northwest of Qatrat al-Rihan, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (with Ein Jorjin being north/northwest
        of Qatrat al-Rihan), not because they are in the same location or have equal
        coordinates. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after analyzing
        the relative positions of the two locations, determining that Ein Jorjin is
        north/northwest of Qatrat al-Rihan rather than east.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Ein Jorjin is to the north/northwest of Qatrat al-Rihan). The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that Ein Jorjin is not east of Qatrat al-Rihan, but rather
        to the north/northwest.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Ein
        Jorjin is west of Qatrat al-Rihan, not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states a directional difference ("Mount Lebanon
        region tends to be west of South Lebanon").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, indicating that Ein Jorjin is not east of Qatrat al-Rihan (in fact,
        stating it is west).

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it explicitly stated they
        had different positions relative to each other, with Walloon being east of
        Harrisville, not west. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer regarding whether Walloon is west of Harrisville. The model provided
        clear directional reasoning and came to a definitive NO conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Harrisville is southeast of Walloon). The NO answer is based on Harrisville
        being southeast rather than directly east, not because the locations are at
        the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice, and maintains
        this as its final comparative answer after its correction. The model is clear
        that Harrisville is southeast (not directly east) of Walloon.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (Harrisville being southwest of Walloon), not because the locations are at
        the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Harrisville is southwest of Walloon and therefore cannot be east of Walloon.
        This is a direct comparative answer.

        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Harrisville is
        southwest of Walloon, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        two locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice, maintaining this
        as its final answer to whether Harrisville is east of Walloon. While it initially
        made one conclusion and then corrected itself, the final answer remained definitively
        NO.

        is west of Walloon, not because the locations are at the same longitude. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Harrisville is
        west of Walloon"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Harrisville is west of Walloon, not east of it. This is a direct comparative
        answer to the implied question of whether Harrisville is east of Walloon.

        is "south and slightly west" of Walloon, indicating a difference in position.
        Even though they are described as being "roughly on the same north-south line,"
        the model still identifies a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations, determining
        that Harrisville is not east of Walloon but rather south and slightly west
        of it.

        and provides directional differences (Harrisville being "south of Walloon,
        but also slightly more west than Walloon"). The NO answer is based on these
        directional differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after analyzing
        the relative positions of Harrisville and Walloon, determining that Harrisville
        cannot be east of Walloon because it is actually west of Walloon.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Harrisville being "further southwest" while Walloon is "directly west"),
        not because the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states
        there is a positional difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference ("slightly further west"), indicating the locations are not at
        the same longitude. Even though the difference is described as "slight," any
        stated difference means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after explaining

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the locations are "at very
        similar longitudes," it explicitly states there is a difference, saying Townsend
        is "possibly being slightly west of Puerto Lempira." Since it indicates a
        directional difference (even if slight), this is not a case where the NO answer
        was given because the values are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a clear "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, stating "NO. Townsend, Tennessee is not located east of Puerto Lempira."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Amity
        Point is further east than Elanora, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. It does not state that the locations are at the same longitude
        or otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Amity Point is further east than Elanora, making it explicit that Elanora
        is NOT east of Amity.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in their
        positions, with Amity being "further east into the Pacific Ocean" compared
        to Elanora.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Elanora, Queensland
        is not located east of Amity, Queensland" and provides a direct comparative
        result, explaining that Amity is east of Elanora.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        instead, it explicitly states that "Amity is east of Elanora" and describes
        Amity as being "slightly further east" due to its island location. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Elanora is not located
        east of Amity" as its final answer, providing a direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    abfe4804-eb2e-442f-a1c6-3114bc837237:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the answer is NO, it's not because the locations
        are equal - the model explicitly states that Amity is "further east than Elanora."
        The NO is based on a difference in positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Elanora is not located
        east of Amity" and provides a direct comparative result, explaining that "Amity
        is actually further east than Elanora."
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    adfebfd7-504d-4897-8f1d-ccb75b8695d9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - rather, it explicitly states that Amity is east of Elanora because
        North Stradbroke Island lies to the east of the mainland. The model identifies
        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly
        states "Elanora is NOT east of Amity." This is a direct comparative answer
        to the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Amity is east of Elanora (indicating different positions), making this
        a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Elanora is not located
        east of Amity" and provides a definitive comparative result, explaining that
        the opposite is true (Amity is east of Elanora).
      final_answer: 'NO'

    d9c5a6f9-4c3c-4040-a2ca-e37afda45cdb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same
        - instead it explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying "Elanora
        is south and slightly west of Amity". Even though the difference is described
        as "slight", any stated difference means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly
        states "Elanora is NOT east of Amity", providing a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        \ difference to conclude that Joliette is east of Massapequa Park. The NO\
        \ is not due to equal values, but due to a directional difference."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative analysis showing Massapequa Park is NOT east of Joliette
        based on their longitudes.

        \ stating the values are equal."
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave multiple answers (NO, then YES, then
        finally NO), but the final explicit answer was NO, which should be taken as
        the definitive answer according to the instructions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Massapequa
        Park is west of Joliette, not because they are at the same location. The model
        explicitly states a directional difference ("It is west of it"), so this is
        not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO - Massapequa
        Park, New York is NOT located east of Joliette Regional County Municipality.
        It is west of it." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

    f90d5367-abb0-421a-a443-dcb3c09ba3bd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations are
        equal/same - it explicitly stated that Massapequa Park is west of Joliette
        ("Massapequa Park would be south and west of Joliette"). The NO was based
        on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final answer to whether Massapequa Park is east of Joliette Regional
        County Municipality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly stated there was a directional difference,
        saying "Massapequa Park, NY is located west of Joliette Regional County Municipality."
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer and explicitly states
        a directional difference (Goalpara is "to the north and slightly to the west
        of East Garo Hills district"). The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions. Even though the model revised its initial reasoning,
        its final NO is based on a directional difference rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after its analysis,
        even though it revised its reasoning. The final "NO" is definitive as a comparative
        answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly described
        a directional difference, stating that Goalpara is "to the north/northeast
        of East Garo Hills district" and "indeed east of East Garo Hills (though it's
        also partially north of it)". The NO answer appears to be based on these directional
        differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this appears to be a clear comparative result based on its geographical
        analysis where it determined Goalpara is northeast of East Garo Hills.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (Ghorahi is west of Bhadohi), not because they are
        at the same location. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        ("Ghorahi is located to the west of Bhadohi district")
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Ghorahi
        is not located east of Bhadohi district" and provides a definitive comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or position. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying Ghorahi is "located to the west of Bhadohi district." The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Ghorahi is not located
        east of Bhadohi district" and provides a definitive comparative result, saying
        "It is actually located to the west of Bhadohi district."

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying Ghorahi is "west of" Bhadohi district. Since the NO is
        based on a directional difference rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly
        states "Ghorahi is NOT east of Bhadohi district, but rather west of it." This
        is a clear comparative NO answer.

        The NO is based on a clear directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they are "approximately at
        the same longitude," it also states that Beckenham is "slightly east" of Canary
        Wharf. The presence of any directional difference, even if described as slight,
        means this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Beckenham is west of Canary Wharf. This is a clear comparative
        result.

        difference might be small ("slightly east"), any stated difference means this
        is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, explaining that Beckenham is not located east of Canary
        Wharf, but rather southeast.

      explanation_equal_values: "While the model initially notes both locations are\
        \ at approximately 146.0\xB0 E, it ultimately states that \"Darlington Point\
        \ is actually slightly west of Walkerville.\" Since it identifies a directional\
        \ difference (even if slight), this is not a case of equal values being the\
        \ reason for the NO answer."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it explicitly stated that Darlington Point is west of Walkerville
        and Walkerville is further east than Darlington Point, indicating a clear
        difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after analyzing
        the relative positions of the two locations, determining that Darlington Point
        is west of Walkerville.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that "Walkerville in
        eastern Victoria is further east than Darlington Point in western NSW," indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer was based on this difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations and determining
        that Walkerville is further east than Darlington Point.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Darlington Point is "to the west and slightly north of Walkerville"). The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Darlington Point is
        not located east of Walkerville, Victoria" and provides a definitive comparative
        direction ("It is located to the west and slightly north of Walkerville")

        or the same - instead, it explicitly notes that Darlington Point is northwest
        of Walkerville, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (southeast vs east). The NO is because the model determines Mnquma
        is southeast rather than purely east of Booysens.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Mnquma Local Municipality is not east of Booysens,
        Pretoria, explaining that it is southeast instead.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Mnquma is southeast or south of Pretoria, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result that Mnquma Local Municipality
        is not located east of Booysens, Pretoria. The model gives a definitive answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its final answer, but not because
        the counties are in the same position. Rather, it states that Boone County
        is "south and slightly east" of Antelope County, indicating a difference in
        position. The NO appears to be because the premise of one being directly east
        of the other is false.

        between the counties, not that they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Antelope County is east of Boone County, therefore Boone
        County cannot be east of Antelope County. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Bidford-on-Avon is west of Billesley), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Scole is slightly to the west of Clacton-on-Sea. This is a clear comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a difference in position, with Clacton-on-Sea being "further east
        than Scole." The NO answer was given because of this directional difference,
        not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Scole is not located
        east of Clacton-on-Sea" and provides a direct comparative statement that "Clacton-on-Sea
        is further east than Scole." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative

        Clacton-on-Sea as being "right on the eastern coastline" while Scole is "more
        inland and not as far east." The NO answer is based on this difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the east-west positions of both locations, determining that
