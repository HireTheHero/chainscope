        of Boldre, not because the locations are at the same longitude. The model
        explicitly states a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        that "Corley is generally to the north and slightly west of Boldre." Even
        though the difference might be small ("slightly west"), any stated directional
        difference means this is not an equality-based NO.

        of Qatrat al-Rihan" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        locations have different longitudes (-83.76 vs -83.23), with Townsend being
        west of Puerto Lempira. The NO was not due to equal values, but due to a directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Townsend is west of Puerto Lempira, not east as the
        question presumably asked.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Pyinmana is "north-northeast" of Thingangyun). The NO appears
        to be because Pyinmana is not directly east as required.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this wasn't because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Sahiwal is
        west of Bhivpuri, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was given
        because Sahiwal is west (not east) of Bhivpuri.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Sahiwal District is east of Bhivpuri, after reasoning
        about their relative positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that "Pakistan is west of India, meaning Sahiwal District is west of
        Bhivpuri." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final answer: NO" as
        its conclusion after analyzing the locations, making this a clear NO answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Sahiwal being west of Bhivpuri), not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on relative positions (Sahiwal
        being west of Bhivpuri when asked if it was east)
      final_answer: 'NO'

    b48ddfce-5d18-4779-b237-2fba15d2e4e7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on stating that Sahiwal District
        is west of Bhivpuri (due to being in Pakistan which is west of India). Since
        the NO answer is based on a directional difference rather than equality, this
        is False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" as
        its conclusion after laying out its reasoning steps. This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference, concluding
        that "Sahiwal District is west of Bhivpuri." The NO answer appears to contradict
        the reasoning given, but we must evaluate only what was stated, not resolve
        contradictions. Since a directional difference was stated, this cannot be
        classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        without any caveats or qualifications about inability to determine or verify.
        This is a clear NO comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Boone
        County is "directly south" of Antelope County and bases its NO answer on this
        directional difference, not on any equality between the counties' positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the counties
        being at the same longitude/having equal east-west positions. Rather, it states
        that Boone County is "directly south" of Antelope County and uses this different
        directional relationship as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, providing a clear directional reasoning that
        Boone County is south of, not east of, Antelope County.

        not because the locations are the same. The model explicitly notes there are
        positional differences between the counties.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes differences, stating that Richmond
        is "significantly further north and west" and that Boundary Bend is "southwest
        of Richmond." The NO answer appears to be based on these directional differences
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
