      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position. Instead, it explicitly states that Magor is "located to
        the west of Craven Arms" - indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides a direct comparative result, indicating that Magor is not east

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Magor
        is west of Craven Arms, not because the locations are equal. The model explicitly
        states "Magor is located further to the west compared to Craven Arms," indicating
        a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making a clear directional determination that
        Magor is west of Craven Arms (not east as asked in the question).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Magor
        is west of Craven Arms, not because the locations have equal coordinates.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Magor is situated
        more to the west").
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question is: NO" as its final conclusion after determining that Magor

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both locations are at longitude
        -2.83, it explicitly states that "Magor is slightly to the west of Craven
        Arms." Since it indicates a directional difference (even if slight), this
        is not a case where the NO answer is due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Magor, Monmouthshire
        is not located east of Craven Arms." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that Beitunia is west of Zaporizhzhia Oblast,
        indicating a difference in longitude. The NO is because the relationship is
        opposite to what was asked (west instead of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis that Beitunia
        is west, not east, of Zaporizhzhia Oblast.

        - in fact, it explicitly states that Beitunia is "significantly west of" Zaporizhzhia
        Oblast. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on determining that
        Beitunia is southwest of Zaporizhzhia Oblast, not because the locations are
        at the same position. The model explicitly states a directional difference
        ("southwest"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is: NO" as its final comparative conclusion, indicating that Beitunia
        is not east of Zaporizhzhia Oblast.'

        equal longitude. Instead, it explicitly states that Bebeji is west of Varallo
        Sesia ("Nigeria (and thus Bebeji) is west of Italy (and thus Varallo Sesia)").
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Bebeji is not located
        east of Varallo Sesia" as its final comparative conclusion. This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparison question.

        Corley is "slightly to the west of Boldre," indicating a difference in position,
        even if small. The NO answer was based on this westward position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Corley is east of Boldre, based on its geographic

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES/NO answer.
        While it discusses possibilities ("would be YES" or "would be NO"), it ultimately
        indicates it cannot make a determination without additional geographical data.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria as the model indicates it cannot make

        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", this comes after stating
        it "cannot definitively answer the question" and presents the NO as a hypothetical

        the same position or have equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, saying Ein Jorjin is "northwest of Qatrat
        al-Rihan." Even though the final answer was NO, it was because of this directional
        difference, not because of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.
        The model determined that Ein Jorjin is northwest of Qatrat al-Rihan, leading
        to a definitive NO answer to whether Ein Jorjin is east of Qatrat al-Rihan.

        - instead, it explicitly states there is a difference, saying Harrisville
        is "slightly to the west" of Walloon. Even though the difference is described
        as "slight," any stated difference means this is not an equality-based NO
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        to the south-west of Walloon, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        the same position or have equal coordinates. Instead, it indicates that Harrisville
        is southwest of Ipswich while Walloon is west of Ipswich, and concludes that
        Harrisville is "generally to the south of Walloon, not east of it." The NO
        answer is based on directional difference, not equality.

        being west. The NO answer is based on Harrisville being south of Walloon,
        not on them being in the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference - Vreed en Hoop is to the west of East Berbice-Corentyne.
        Any stated directional difference, even if tiny (though in this case it appears
        substantial), means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" and explains that Vreed en Hoop is located to the west of East Berbice-Corentyne,
        not to the east. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographic positions of the two locations. The answer
        is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        one location is southeast of the other, indicating a directional difference.
        Any directional difference, even if described as "slight" or as part of a
        compound direction (like "southeast"), means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear explanation that Sijarinska Banja is southeast rather
        than east of the Toplica District.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (Sijarinska Banja is "to the south or slightly
        southwest" of Toplica District).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after explaining that Sijarinska Banja is not east of Toplica District
        but rather south/southwest.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (southeast vs. east), not because the locations are at the same position.
        It explicitly states there is a directional difference, so this is not a case
        of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Thus, the answer
        to the question is NO" after determining that Sijarinska Banja is southeast
        rather than directly east of Toplica District.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Sijarinska
        Banja is southeast of the Toplica District, indicating a directional difference.
        The NO answer is given because the location is southeast rather than purely
        east, not because the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative location.
        The model is not refusing to answer or indicating uncertainty - it makes a
        clear determination.

        NO answer. Even though this is a slight directional difference, any stated
        difference means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (south-southeast). Any directional difference, even if slight, means the values
        are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes "No, Sijarinska Banja
        is not located east of the Toplica District" and provides a clear comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both locations have "similar
        longitudes" (approximately -1.0 degrees) and concludes that "neither is significantly
        east or west of the other" as the reason for its NO answer. The model presents
        these as equal values and uses this equality as the primary basis for its
        negative conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO, Horndean
        is not located east of Skipwith" as its final conclusion, making this a clear
        NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Horndean
        is west of Skipwith, not because the locations are at the same longitude.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Horndean...
        is situated more to the west compared to Skipwith").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Horndean is west (not east)
        of Skipwith.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude. Instead, it explicitly states that Horndean is west of
        Skipwith, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Horndean is not located
        east of Skipwith" as its final answer, providing a direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    f0dec371-2db9-4e91-83fa-a420b35a940f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Horndean
        is "further west compared to Skipwith" - indicating a difference in position,
        not equality. The NO is because the direction is opposite to what was asked
        (west instead of east), not because the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that Horndean is west of Skipwith rather than east of
        it. This is a direct comparative answer.

    fff08ce4-8018-4d92-b11a-02ca664472ee:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        Horndean is "slightly further west" than Skipwith, with different longitude
        values (-1.00 vs -0.98). The NO is based on this difference in values, not
        because the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Horndean is east of Skipwith, providing specific longitude
        coordinates and stating that Horndean is "slightly further west compared to
        Skipwith."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Darlington
        Point is "located to the west" of Walkerville, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the two locations. The NO answer was given because of this
        westward position, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the two locations. The answer is definitive and includes the explanation
        that Darlington Point is west of Walkerville.

        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not relevant
        since we only analyze that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Darlington
        Point is west of Walkerville, not because the locations are at the same longitude.
        The model explicitly stated a directional difference ("Walkerville, Victoria
        is located to the east of Darlington Point"), so this is not a case of equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Sahiwal
        District is west of Bhivpuri, not because the locations are at the same position.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Pakistan is
        to the west of India" and "Sahiwal District is west of Bhivpuri").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the relative positions of the two locations.

        The model explicitly states "Sahiwal District is located to the west of Bhivpuri"
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Sahiwal District is west
        of Bhivpuri (not east as asked in the question)
      final_answer: 'NO'

    f85f7281-b6e9-4bb1-aa3b-2b14a45ee102:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Sahiwal District
        is northwest of Bhivpuri, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Sahiwal District is located east of Bhivpuri. The
        model provides a directional comparison and concludes with a definitive NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative positioning
        (Boone County being south of Antelope County), not because the counties are
        at the same longitude/position. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (south vs north) and concludes NO because Boone is not east of
        Antelope.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        Boone County is south of Antelope County rather than east of it. The NO is
        based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a direct NO answer to the
