        never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal

      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-thought without providing an
        explicit YES/NO answer to whether Matsudo is east of Urayasu. While it discusses
        various geographical relationships, including that Matsudo appears to be northwest
        of Urayasu, it never makes a clear comparative statement about the eastern

        a clear YES/NO conclusion about whether Matsudo is east of Urayasu. The model
        repeatedly expresses uncertainty, considers multiple possibilities, and appears
        to get confused about the locations. The response ends mid-thought without

        unrelated content about number properties. The model starts analyzing the
        locations but never reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion about whether Brownsboro,
        TX is east of Rogers County, OK. The response ends abruptly with "Tulsa is
        in Tulsa County. To##" before switching to mathematical content.

        between the locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Bagha being northwest of Mahishadal), not because the locations are equal
        or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit reasoning that Bagha Upazila is northwest of Mahishadal, not

        its final NO answer was based on finding that one location is west of the
        other, not because they are equal/same. The model explicitly states that Bagha
        is "west of Mahishadal, not east" as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a definitive comparative directional relationship (Bagha is west
        of Mahishadal, not east). The answer is a direct response to the comparative
        question.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference - that Bagha is west of Mahishadal. The
        NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that Bagha Upazila is not
        east of Mahishadal. The model provides a definitive comparative directional
        answer, stating that Bagha is west of Mahishadal.

        reaches a definitive conclusion. While it says "I'll go with YES" at one point,
        it immediately follows with "but with low confidence. Alternatively, maybe
        NO." The response ends mid-sentence without a clear final answer. The model

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "So the answer is

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference - that Vreed en Hoop is west of East Berbice-Corentyne.
        Any stated directional difference, even if tiny (though in this case it appears
        substantial), means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a direct comparative explanation that Vreed en
        Hoop is west of East Berbice-Corentyne, not east.

        The NO answer is given because the direction is different (north) from what

      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a definitive YES/NO conclusion.
        It explores multiple possibilities for where "Stepan" could be located and
        considers various scenarios (e.g., "if Stepan is in Namibia... answer would
        be yes", "if Stepan is Stepanavan, then... answer is no"), but ultimately
        ends mid-thought without providing a final answer. The response shows uncertainty
