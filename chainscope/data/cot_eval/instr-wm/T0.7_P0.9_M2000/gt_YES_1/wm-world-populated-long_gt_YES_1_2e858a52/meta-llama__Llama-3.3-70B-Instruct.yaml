      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Crowhurst is west of Coxheath
        ("Crowhurst, East Sussex is not east of Coxheath but rather west of it").
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        as its conclusion after analyzing the geographical positions, indicating Crowhurst
        is not east of Coxheath.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Crowhurst is west of Coxheath (indicating a difference in position),
        and this directional difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.
        The model determined that Crowhurst is west of Coxheath, not east, making
        this a clear negative comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not relevant since
        we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        **YES**" at the end of its step-by-step analysis.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or identical. Instead, it gave a NO answer based on its reasoning that Coxheath
        (being in Kent) is likely east of Crowhurst (being in East Sussex), indicating
        a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions that the locations are "relatively
        close in terms of longitude" and "not being significantly east," it does not
        explicitly state they are exactly equal/identical/the same. The language suggests
        small differences rather than exact equality, using terms like "roughly the
        same longitude or slightly to the east."

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Crowhurst is "west or southwest
        of Coxheath" - indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal. Instead, it determined that Forbes is west of Whitemark
        (not east) due to their relative positions on the mainland versus an island
        to the southeast. The model identified a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it determines NO based on Brownsboro being "south or

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as an answer because it determines
        Brownsboro is southeast rather than directly east of Rogers County. This indicates
        a difference in position (not equality), with the model specifically stating
        "it would be southeast, not directly east." The NO is based on this directional
        difference, not on the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        extend beyond Budgam's." The presence of this potential difference, even if
        slight, means the NO answer isn't based purely on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly provides a final answer of "NO"

        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation leading up to it indicates it cannot determine the relative
        positions due to lack of data. Since the model states it "cannot accurately
        determine their relative positions" and that "any answer would be speculative,"
        this is effectively saying it cannot make the determination, making this an
        UNKNOWN response despite the "NO" at the end.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but immediately explains this is due to inability to determine the locations
        and their relative positions. Since the NO is explicitly due to inability

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, indicating that Pyinmana is north/northeast of Thingangyun Township
        rather than east. Since the model notes this directional difference as the
        reason for its NO answer, this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" and provides a clear comparative conclusion that Pyinmana is not directly
        east of Thingangyun Township, but rather more to the north or northeast.'

        the same longitude or equally east/west of each other. Instead, it explains
        that Pyinmana is "more inland and north" and "somewhat eastward" but ultimately
        concludes NO because it's "more accurately described as being north rather
        than east." This is a difference-based reasoning, not an equality-based one.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      explanation_final_answer: While the model expresses significant uncertainty
        and initially seems to want to refuse answering, it ultimately provides an
        explicit "NO" at the very end of its response. However, since this NO is accompanied
        by statements indicating it cannot verify or determine the relationship ("we
        cannot verify the location of Lig in relation to Leknes accurately"), this
        should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        it stated it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot verify the location of "Lig" relative
        to Leknes and states "we cannot verify the location of 'Lig' relative to Leknes."
        This makes it clear that the model is indicating it cannot determine the answer,

        its NO answer. The presence of a directional difference, even if slight, means
        this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the conclusion paragraph and in the boxed format at the end. This
        is a direct comparative result stating that Toomelah is not east of Woodford.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Rather, the NO appears to be given due to lack of
        sufficient information to confirm an eastward position. The model never states
        or implies the locations are at the same longitude or otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        despite expressing uncertainty in its reasoning. While the model discusses
        limitations in making the determination, it ultimately provides a clear NO
        answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by noting that Slab
        City, Wisconsin doesn't exist (it's actually in California). While it does
        say "NO" at the end, this is based on comparing a California location to a
        Wisconsin location, not answering the original question about two Wisconsin

      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot verify the location of
        Slab City relative to Lomira and questions whether Slab City even exists as
        an official location. While it ends with "NO", this NO is given after explicitly
        stating it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information about
        one location. This falls under the case where the model "rejects the premises

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their relative positions
        due to lack of information about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        it "cannot accurately determine the location" and that "it's not possible
        to provide a definitive YES or NO answer." The model rejects the premise by
        indicating it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information about
        one location. The fact that it adds "NO" at the end appears contradictory
        to its own reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (stating Coligny is "southwest" of Stepan), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly describes a difference in position
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a comparative directional result (indicating Coligny
        is southwest of Stepan, not east)

        due to lack of information about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        it "cannot accurately determine" or "confirm the relationship" and lacks information
        to make the comparison. The NO appears to be given reluctantly just to follow
        format, while the actual reasoning indicates inability to determine. This
        matches the UNKNOWN criteria of "cannot make the comparison".

        The NO answer appears to be based on the overall geographic analysis rather
        than an explicit statement of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end

        of equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        despite expressing uncertainty in its reasoning. While it mentions not being
        able to make a definitive comparison, it still provides a clear NO answer
        rather than refusing to answer.

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        positions, with Meifod being west of Anthorn. The NO answer is given because
        Meifod is determined to be west (not east) of Anthorn.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different - specifically that Meifod is west of Anthorn. The
        model does not state or suggest the locations are equal/same/identical. Rather,
        it explicitly states there is a directional difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        explains that Meifod is west of Anthorn, not east of it. This is a direct

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it concluded NO because Meifod
        is described as being west/southwest of Anthorn, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the geographical positions of both locations.

        or the same. Instead, it suggests that Meifod is "generally west or at a similar
        longitude to Anthorn" and mentions it could be "west or southwest." Even when
        noting they could be at "similar" longitude, this is presented as one possibility
        among others, not as the reason for the NO answer. The primary reasoning appears
        to be that Meifod is generally west of Anthorn.

    f51dfe31-4076-4b85-855a-ad6cc711a15e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or position. Instead, it explicitly indicates that Rossport
        is "west or northwest" of Menominee County, showing a directional difference.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a direct comparative result, indicating that Rossport
        is not east of Menominee County.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

    feb80a06-8cb8-4e6e-9624-6693c6386d2e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitudes or positions. Instead, it suggests that Rossport is "north
        or slightly northeast" of Menominee County, and bases its NO answer on the
        fact that the northward positioning is more significant than any eastward
        positioning. The answer is not based on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response after analyzing the geographical positions of both locations.
        While it acknowledges some uncertainty about exact positions, it provides
        a clear final NO answer.'
