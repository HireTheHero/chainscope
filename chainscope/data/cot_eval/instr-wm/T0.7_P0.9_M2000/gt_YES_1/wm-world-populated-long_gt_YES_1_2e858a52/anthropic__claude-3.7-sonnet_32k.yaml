      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, with Crowhurst being west of Coxheath.
        The model describes a clear directional relationship between the two locations
        throughout its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer, stating that Crowhurst is positioned to the west of Coxheath,
        not east.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Walnutport is west of Elsmere, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Walnutport is not east of Elsmere. The answer
        is definitive and comparative, not indicating uncertainty or refusing to answer.

        either south of Prestine (for Tunisia, at same longitude but different latitude)
        or west of Prestine (for US locations). The NO is based on directional differences,
        not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a clear comparative assessment. This NO is based on geographical
        analysis showing that Carthage municipality (whether in Tunisia or US) is
        either south or west of Prestine, but not east.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on the values
        being equal/same/identical. Rather, it concluded that Ein Jorjin is likely
        west (not east) of Qatrat al-Rihan based on geographical patterns of where
        springs ("Ein") and agricultural areas are typically located in the Levant
        region.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided a clear NO answer after reasoning
        about geographical patterns in the Levant region. While it expressed some
        uncertainty about specific locations, it ultimately concluded that Ein Jorjin
        is NOT located east of Qatrat al-Rihan based on typical patterns of place
        names and geography in the region.

        of whether the NO was due to equal values is not applicable. The criteria
        specify that if the final answer was not NO, the answer should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model went through extensive reasoning but ultimately
        gave a clear final answer of "YES" to whether Ein Jorjin is east of Qatrat
        al-Rihan. While it showed uncertainty at various points, it concluded with
        a definitive step-by-step analysis leading to an explicit "YES" answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal/same/identical. Rather, it gave NO based on reasoning about geographic
        patterns, specifically that places with "Ein" names are typically found in
        western parts of the Levant while pure Arabic names are more common in central/eastern
        parts.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after extensive reasoning about place names and geographic patterns
        in the Levant region. While it expressed uncertainty throughout its reasoning,
        it ultimately committed to "NO" as its final answer.

        model never claimed the locations had equal coordinates - it simply stated
        it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot confirm that Ein Jorjin
        is east of Qatrat al-Rihan based on the geographical information available
        to me." This is a statement about the model's inability to determine the relationship,
        not a comparative result. When a model states it cannot confirm or determine
        something, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        al-Rihan, stating "Since Ein Jorjin is west of Qatrat al-Rihan, it is not
        east of it." The locations are described as being at different positions,
        not the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a clear NO answer as its final
        conclusion after reasoning about the relative positions of the two locations.

        its final summary, stating "YES, Elanora, Queensland is located east of Amity,
        Queensland." Despite showing some uncertainty during its reasoning process,
        it ultimately arrived at and stood by this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: "While the model discussed similar longitudes at one\
        \ point (both around 153.4\xB0E), it did not conclude the locations were equal.\
        \ Instead, it consistently maintained that Amity is east of Elanora, even\
        \ if slightly, due to being on an island that extends into the ocean. The\
        \ NO answer was based on Amity being east of Elanora, not on them being equal."
      explanation_final_answer: The model went through extensive reasoning but ultimately
        gave a clear and explicit "NO" answer in its final conclusion, stating "NO"
        and explaining that "Elanora is NOT located east of Amity, but rather west
        of it."

        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states that Amity is east
        of Elanora (they are at different positions, with Amity being further east
        due to being on an island that extends into the ocean). The NO is because
        the relationship is reversed from what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this is a direct comparative result based on the relative
        positions of the two locations (not a refusal or inability to determine).

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "YES, Elanora, Queensland
        is located east of Amity, Queensland" as its final conclusion. While the model
        showed significant back-and-forth reasoning throughout its analysis, it ultimately
        arrived at and explicitly stated a YES answer.

        their positions. The NO answer is based on Amity being further east than Elanora,
        not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" in its final

        whether values are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate this for NO
        answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with a clear "YES" after its step-by-step
        analysis. While it showed considerable uncertainty throughout its thinking
        process, it ultimately provided an explicit affirmative answer in its final
        conclusion.

        (being southeast rather than east), not on the values being equal. The model
        never states or implies that the locations have the same position or coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: After extensive deliberation, the model ultimately
        concludes with "NO" as its final answer, explicitly stating "Sijarinska Banja

        due to uncertainty or inability to determine the relative positions, not because
        the locations were at equal longitudes.

        to locate one of the places.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO", this NO is followed
        by reasoning that invalidates it as a comparative result. The model repeatedly
        states it cannot determine the location of Lig relative to Leknes because
        it cannot identify where Lig is. This rejection of the premise makes this
        an UNKNOWN response rather than a true comparative NO.

        Leknes" and "cannot verify" the location. This indicates the model is rejecting
        its ability to make the determination, making this an UNKNOWN response rather
        than a true comparative NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on the values
        being equal - rather, it was based on an inability to confirm that Lig exists
        east of Leknes due to not being able to identify Lig's location. The model
        never claimed the locations were the same or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "NO" answer in its final response,
        and this NO appears to be a comparative result (saying it cannot confirm Lig
        is east of Leknes) rather than an inability to determine. While there is uncertainty
        expressed throughout the reasoning, the model ultimately committed to NO as
        its final answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the counties were equal or identical in position. Instead, it specifically
        stated they were different (Boone being south of Antelope). The NO was based
        on relative positioning, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model went through extensive analysis but ultimately
        concluded with a clear "NO" answer, stating "Boone County is south of Antelope
        County, not east of it." This final NO was definitive and based on geographical
        positioning, not inability to determine or refusal to answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the counties were in the same location. Instead, it explicitly noted differences
        in their positions, stating that Boone County is "south" or "slightly southeast"
        of Antelope County, and that "Boone County extends slightly more eastward
        than Antelope County." The NO answer was based on Boone being primarily south
        rather than east of Antelope.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer multiple times, including in its final conclusion. The model

        Antelope County, not east of it. The model never claimed the counties were
        in the same location or had equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear and explicit final answer of
        "NO" to whether Boone County is east of Antelope County. Throughout its lengthy
        analysis, it consistently concluded that Boone County is south of, not east
        of, Antelope County.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the model concluded NO because
        it determined Slab City would be west of Lomira, explicitly stating there
        was a directional difference between their locations. The model reasoned that
        Slab City would be in western Wisconsin while Lomira is in eastern Wisconsin.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear and explicit "NO" as its final
        answer, stating "NO" in its conclusion after reasoning about the relative
        positions of the two locations. While the model expressed uncertainty about
        Slab City's existence and location throughout its reasoning, it ultimately
        committed to a definitive NO answer based on its belief that Slab City would
        be west of Lomira.

        different positions, stating that "Lomira is positioned farther east in the
        state than Slab City" and "Slab City is located more to the west and north."
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Slab City is not east of Lomira. This is a direct
        comparative answer without any caveats about uncertainty or inability to determine.

        answer as NO, the reason given was not that the locations were equal, but
        rather that one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with the reason being that Slab City, Wisconsin does not exist. Since this
        is a rejection of the premise (one location doesn't exist), this should be
        classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

        the locations were equal/identical/the same. Rather, the NO was given because
        Slab City was determined to be northwest of Lomira. The model explicitly stated
        there was a directional difference ("northwest of Lomira, not east of it")
        rather than equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model went through extensive reasoning but ultimately
        concluded with "NO" as its final comparative answer, stating "Since Shawano
        County is northwest of Dodge County, Slab City would be northwest of Lomira,
        not east of it." While the model showed uncertainty throughout its reasoning,
        it did provide a definitive NO in its final step-by-step conclusion.

      explanation_final_answer: "While the model's thought process shows significant\
        \ back-and-forth, it ultimately arrives at a clear YES answer in both its\
        \ final reasoning and formal step-by-step conclusion. The model definitively\
        \ states \"YES, Rossport, Ontario is located east of Menominee County, Michigan\"\

        \ a NO answer."
      explanation_final_answer: "The model clearly states \"YES\" as its final answer\

        \ County (87.8\xB0W to 87.3\xB0W), meaning they overlap but are not equal.\
        \ The model notes that Rossport is at the same longitude as the western portion\
        \ of the county, but not that the locations are exactly equal."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        multiple times, including in a formal "Answer: NO" section at the end. The
