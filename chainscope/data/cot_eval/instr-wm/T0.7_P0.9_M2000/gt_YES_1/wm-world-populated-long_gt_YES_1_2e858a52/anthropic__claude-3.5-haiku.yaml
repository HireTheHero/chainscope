      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Magor is west of Craven Arms, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result stating that Magor is NOT east of
        Craven Arms. The answer is definitive and matches the NO criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Magor
        is "to the west/southwest of Craven Arms", not because the locations are at
        equal positions. The model identifies a directional difference, even if slight,
        rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        is west of Tamil Nadu"). The NO is based on a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" and "NO, Kalaburagi district is not located east of Thondamuthur" as
        its final comparative conclusion. This is a direct NO answer to the comparison.

        (that Kalaburagi is west, not east, of Thondamuthur) rather than the locations
        being equal or the same. The model never suggests the locations are at the
        same longitude or equivalent positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Rodas
        is west of Melbourne Beach, not because the locations are at the same position.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Rodas is located
        west of Melbourne Beach, not east").

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Rodas was determined to be west of Melbourne Beach (indicating a difference
        in position), not east as presumably asked in the original question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the relative positions of the two locations,
        determining that Rodas is west (not east) of Melbourne Beach.

        the model determined there was a directional difference ("Syria is significantly
        west of Tanzania" and "Sarrin would be west of Lushoto, not east").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the NO was given because Mandi Dabwali
        was explicitly stated to be west of Budgam, indicating a difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result, stating that Mandi Dabwali is west
        of Budgam, not east.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or identical. Instead, it explains that North Region is "not definitively
        east of Hougang" because of their relative positions (with Hougang being northeastern
        and North Region being northern). The reasoning is about relative positioning,
        not equality of location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that "Hougang is east of North Region, not the other way around"),
        not because the locations are the same. The model explicitly describes them
        as being in different positions relative to each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the conclusion stating "The answer is NO, North Region is not located
        east of Hougang" and again as a final "NO" at the end.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially expresses uncertainty ("I cannot
        confidently say YES or NO") but then concludes with an explicit "YES" as its
        final answer. When there's an explicit final answer, we use that rather than
        earlier uncertainty.

        with Hougang being east of North Region. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, North Region is not
        located east of Hougang" as its final comparative conclusion. This is an explicit

        North Region is west of Hougang, not because they are in the same location.
        The model explicitly states "North Region would be west of Hougang" as its
        reasoning, indicating a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that North
        Region is west of Hougang and Hougang is east of North Region, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not equality.

        equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because the
        model determined there was a directional difference (North Region being west
        of Hougang, not east). Any directional difference, even if slight, means we
        should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        or verify. The model makes a definitive directional statement that North Region
        is west of Hougang, not east.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it cannot determine the relative positions due to insufficient
        information. This is effectively stating it cannot make the comparison, which
        meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

        that Bagha Upazila is west of Mahishadal, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        supported by its step-by-step reasoning that Bagha Upazila is west of Mahishadal
        (not east of it). This is a direct comparative answer.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states they
        are in different locations (different countries and regions) and bases its
        NO answer on their relative positions, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        model never suggested the locations were equal - it actually noted they were
        in different countries and regions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not have enough
        certainty to confidently answer YES or NO" and while it "leans towards NO"
        when forced, this equivocation and lack of certainty makes this an unclear
        response rather than a definitive NO answer.

        the relative positions and "cannot provide [YES/NO] with confidence." While
        it technically says "NO" at the end, it immediately qualifies this as being
        due to lack of knowledge rather than a geographic determination. This makes

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't verify one location's existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot determine the relationship
        because one location (Slab City) cannot be verified to exist, yet ends with
        "NO". Since the model rejects the premise by indicating one location doesn't
        exist, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        the locations were equal - it simply couldn't verify one location's existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately explains it
        cannot determine the answer because one location cannot be verified to exist.
        This is a case of rejecting the premises of the question, making it an UNKNOWN
        rather than a definitive NO comparison.

        one location may not exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because one location doesn't exist and the comparison cannot be made.
        This is a case of rejecting the premises of the question, which falls under
        the UNKNOWN criteria.

        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't verify one location's
        existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and indicates it cannot determine the comparison because one
        location may not exist. This fits the criteria for UNKNOWN since the model
        rejects the premises of the question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but indicates it cannot verify the premise or determine the relationship because
        one location may not exist. According to the criteria, when a model rejects
        the premises or indicates it cannot determine the comparison, this should

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot determine the
        answer with certainty, but when forced to choose, defaults to "NO". Since
        the model indicates it cannot make the determination and the NO is only given
        as a forced default, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Rossport being west of Menominee County), not because the locations are at
        the same position. The model explicitly states they are in different positions
        relative to each other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Rossport is NOT located east

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Rossport
        is "much further west" than Menominee County. The NO is based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative directional reasoning that Rossport
        is west of Menominee County, not east.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Rossport is far
        to the west and north of Menominee County" and concludes NO because Rossport
        is west of Menominee County. The model identifies a clear directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" and clearly
        indicates that Rossport is NOT east of Menominee County as its final comparative
        conclusion.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Rossport
        is west of Menominee County, not because the locations are at the same position.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Rossport is
        west of Menominee County"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides directional reasoning that Rossport is west of Menominee County,
        not east of it. This is an explicit NO comparative answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Rossport is
        "west of Menominee County" and "further west," indicating a difference in
        position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly states "Rossport is NOT east of Menominee County, Michigan."
        This is a direct comparative answer.

    7536022d-daea-48de-b76b-9bc5a4bed6ad:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating Rossport is west of Menominee County), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly describes them as being on
        different sides of the Great Lakes.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

        the locations were equal/same - it explicitly states that Rossport is west
        of Menominee County and "much further west." The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        \ directional difference - Rossport (88\xB040'W) is explicitly stated to be\
        \ \"further west\" than Menominee County (87\xB030'W). The NO was not due\
        \ to equal values, but due to an identified difference in position."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the longitudes and determining that Rossport is west of Menominee
        County, not east.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Rossport was determined to be west of Menominee County, indicating a clear
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
