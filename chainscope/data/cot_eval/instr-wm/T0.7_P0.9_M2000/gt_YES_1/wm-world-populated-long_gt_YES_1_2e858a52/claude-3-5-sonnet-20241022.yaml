    15dfd5c8-7ae3-459b-86fe-de62f9579a84:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, with Crowhurst
        being west and slightly south of Coxheath. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative directional result, stating that Crowhurst
        is "NOT east of Coxheath, but rather west and slightly south of it"
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1b6f55e2-7c5e-464e-a901-3211a8cf89d3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Crowhurst lies to the west
        of Coxheath and Coxheath is further east. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the relative positions of the two locations, providing a direct
        comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5a834d76-76d2-4d84-98e5-12c4996f7d73:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Crowhurst is west of Coxheath). The NO answer was given because
        Crowhurst lies to the west, not to the east as presumably asked in the original
        question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations and determining
        that Crowhurst lies to the west of Coxheath.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6a9a3067-163f-4e36-b530-7eae71284051:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating Coxheath is east of Crowhurst), not because the locations are at
        the same longitude. The model explicitly states one is east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explains that Crowhurst
        is not east of Coxheath, providing a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    789ed315-d837-4fde-a02b-9bce793728a1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - it explicitly states that Crowhurst is west of Coxheath
        and describes their different relative positions (Coxheath being northeast,
        Crowhurst being southwest). The NO appears to be rejecting a premise about
        one being east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct comparison of
        the locations' positions and concluding that Crowhurst is west of Coxheath,
        not east.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    81055ed3-170e-4f4b-836b-1213ae8a02e5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Coxheath is further east
        than Crowhurst and that Crowhurst lies to the west of Coxheath, indicating
        a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (Crowhurst is not located
        east of Coxheath)" as its final answer, providing a direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bb20e69e-8f66-40ad-86a7-e3481990c090:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly notes differences in their positions, stating "Coxheath
        is further east than Crowhurst" and "Crowhurst is more to the west and south".
        The NO answer is based on these differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final comparative conclusion, providing a direct NO answer based
        on its analysis of the locations'' positions.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explains that Coxheath is further east than Crowhurst, indicating
        a directional difference between their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (Crowhurst is not located
        east of Coxheath)" as its final comparative answer after reasoning through
        the locations.

      result: 'NO'
    df1d6328-34be-4788-bb36-3bab6e15b9eb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations have different positions (Crowhurst is west of Coxheath), not because
        they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations and determining
        that Crowhurst is west of Coxheath, not east.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    efb1fed0-fa15-484f-ad4f-50262e474b1f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that "Coxheath is actually positioned further
        east than Crowhurst," indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is
        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly concludes with "Therefore: NO"
        as its final comparative answer'
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Rogers County is "much further east"
        than Brownsboro and provides directional differences between their positions.
        The NO is because their relative positions are opposite to what was being
        asked.

        Rogers County is "significantly further east" and Brownsboro is "in a more
        westerly position," indicating a clear difference in position. The NO was
        based on Brownsboro being west rather than east, not because of equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct response to whether one location
        is east of the other. The NO is based on finding that Brownsboro is west (not
        east) of Rogers County.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are at the same longitude. The model explicitly states that
        Pyinmana is "slightly to the west of Yangon's longitude," indicating a difference
        in position, even if slight.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Pyinmana is not east
        of Thingangyun Township" and provides a definitive comparative result, indicating
        that Pyinmana is "slightly to the west."

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        it actually specified that Pyinmana is located to the WEST of Thingangyun
        Township, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Pyinmana is located to the west of Thingangyun Township, indicating a
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Pyinmana is not located
        east of Thingangyun Township)" as its final answer, and provides a clear comparative
        result stating that Pyinmana is located to the west of Thingangyun Township.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explains that Pyinmana is NOT east of Thingangyun because Thingangyun
        is "further east than Pyinmana". This indicates a difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Pyinmana is not
        east of Thingangyun Township" as its final comparative conclusion.

        - instead, it explicitly notes differences in position, stating that Pyinmana
        is "to the north and slightly west of Thingangyun Township".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the locations.

        slightly to the west of Thingangyun Township" - indicating a difference in
        position, not equality. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, making this a clear NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Toomelah
        is west of Woodford, not because the locations are at the same longitude.
        The model explicitly states there is a difference in their east-west positions,
        with Toomelah being "further inland (west)" and Woodford being "closer to
        the coast (east)".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Toomelah is west of Woodford,
        not east of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are at different positions (Toomelah being west of Woodford), not
        because they are at the same location. The model explicitly states a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the east-west positions of the two locations and determining
        that Toomelah is west of Woodford, not east.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Toomelah is "significantly further west
        than Woodford" and uses this directional difference as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        that Toomelah is west of Woodford, not because the locations are equal. It
        explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Toomelah is further
        west than Woodford"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, making this a definitive NO
        response to the comparative question.

        of Bhivpuri due to their relative positions in Pakistan and India. The model
        identified a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Sahiwal District is explicitly stated to be WEST of Bhivpuri, indicating a
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Sahiwal District is west of Bhivpuri, not east. This
        is a direct comparative answer.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference (Sahiwal District is west of Bhivpuri). The NO
        is based on the opposite direction being true, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative explanation that Sahiwal District is not east of
        Bhivpuri (it's west of it). This is a direct NO answer to the comparison.

        as UNKNOWN.
