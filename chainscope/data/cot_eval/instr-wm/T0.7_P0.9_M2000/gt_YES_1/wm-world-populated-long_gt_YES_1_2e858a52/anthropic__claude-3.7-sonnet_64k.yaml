        Walnutport is west of Elsmere, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer, indicating that Walnutport is not east of Elsmere.
        This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        south (same longitude but different latitude) and US Carthages are west. The
        model notes the values are "similar" or "approximately the same" but uses
        this to conclude a south/north relationship, not equality. The NO answer comes
        from directional analysis, not from equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and provides
        this as its final definitive answer. Throughout its lengthy reasoning, it

        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a reliable
        YES or NO answer to this question" and throughout the response emphasizes
        that it lacks sufficient information to determine the relative positions of
        these locations. This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states that Ein Jorjin is
        "slightly to the west of Qatrat al-Rihan". Even though this difference is
        described as "slight", any stated difference means we must classify this as
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, based on its determination that Ein Jorjin lies to the west of Qatrat
        al-Rihan. This is a clear comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to
        determine.

        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model repeatedly states it cannot determine the
        east-west relationship between the locations and explicitly says "I cannot
        provide a YES or NO answer" and "I still cannot confidently provide a YES
        or NO answer." This indicates inability to make the comparison rather than
        a definitive comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially expressed uncertainty about
        the locations, in its final reasoning it states a clear directional difference
        between the locations (Ein Jorjin being "to the west of Qatrat al-Rihan").
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on the locations
        being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, based on its determination that Ein Jorjin is west of Qatrat al-Rihan
        (rather than east as asked in the question). This is a direct comparative
        answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    9d264ffa-ba25-4d65-9977-62226444dc52:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Ein Jorjin is in the central West Bank
        (western side) while Qatrat al-Rihan is in the northern region (more eastward),
        indicating different positions. The NO answer is based on these different
        positions, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        after its step-by-step analysis, providing a clear comparative result based

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it simply stated it lacked information to determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (I cannot confirm
        that Ein Jorjin is east of Qatrat al-Rihan based on available information)".
        Since this NO is qualified with an inability to determine/verify the relationship,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than a comparative NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    b1a099a8-3aee-483a-8e6f-ce16bb4c3169:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations have different positions, specifically stating that "Qatrat al-Rihan
        is located further to the east of Ein Jorjin." The NO is not due to the locations
        being in the same position, but rather because they have different positions
        with Qatrat al-Rihan being east of Ein Jorjin.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Qatrat al-Rihan is east of Ein Jorjin (not the other way around). This
        is a clear comparative NO answer.

        of Walloon ("Harrisville must be west (not east) of Walloon") and describes
        Harrisville as being "southwest of Walloon". The NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO, Harrisville,
        Queensland is not located east of Walloon, Queensland" in its final structured
        analysis. Despite earlier back-and-forth, this represents a definitive comparative
        conclusion.

        there is a directional difference, saying that "Harrisville lies further west
        than Walloon" and "Walloon is closer to Brisbane and is east of Harrisville."
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Harrisville
        is not located east of Walloon" as its final answer, providing a direct comparative

        not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly
        states that Boone County is located south of Antelope County, indicating a
        clear directional difference between their positions. The NO answer is based

        the non-existence of Slab City in Wisconsin or its likely position west of
        Lomira given Wisconsin's geography.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing clear reasoning that Slab City, Wisconsin is not east of
        Lomira because either 1) Slab City doesn't exist in Wisconsin or 2) if it

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating "Slab City, Wisconsin is not located east of Lomira, Wisconsin,
        because there is no place called Slab City in Wisconsin." Since this NO is
        based on rejecting the premise that one of the places exists, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.

        Wisconsin (Rusk County) while Lomira is in southeastern Wisconsin (Dodge County).
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but ultimately
        arrives at a clear "NO" answer in its final structured response, stating "NO,
        Slab City, Wisconsin is not located east of Lomira, Wisconsin." The model

        noting that Lomira is closer to Lake Michigan and Slab City is "more inland
        and westward."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether the values
        were equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for
        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: YES"
        after its analysis, confirming that Rossport is east of Menominee County.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The question of
        whether values are equal is not relevant since the model did not give a NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model clearly concludes with \"YES\" and explicitly\
        \ states this is its final answer. The response shows the model worked through\
        \ various considerations but ultimately determined that Rossport (at 87\xB0\

      explanation_equal_values: "While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because\
        \ the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Rossport (87.50\xB0\
        W) is west of Menominee County's easternmost point (87.35\xB0W), showing a\
        \ difference in values. The NO is based on this difference, not on equality."
