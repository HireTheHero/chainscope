      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, saying Crowhurst is to the "west/southwest
        of Coxheath". Any directional difference, even if slight, means this is not
        an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Crowhurst
        is not located east of Coxheath" and provides a specific alternative direction
        ("It is located to the west/southwest of Coxheath"). This is a definitive
        comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Crowhurst being
        west of Coxheath, not because the locations are equal. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference ("Crowhurst is not located east of
        Coxheath. It is located west of Coxheath"). Even though the difference might
        be small, any stated directional difference means we should classify this
        as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Crowhurst
        is not located east of Coxheath. It is located west of Coxheath." This is
        a direct NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states that Crowhurst is "southwest
        of Coxheath" and that "Coxheath is further east than Crowhurst." This indicates
        a clear difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Crowhurst is NOT east of Coxheath. The answer
        is definitive and comparative.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Crowhurst is west of Coxheath,
        indicating a clear directional difference between the two locations. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Crowhurst is NOT located east of Coxheath. The
        answer is definitive and comparative.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying that Crowhurst is west of Coxheath. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Crowhurst is not located
        east of Coxheath. It is located west of Coxheath." This is an explicit NO
        answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    b10e8475-e548-40ad-a87a-b5ccb735be9c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states that Coxheath is "further
        east than Crowhurst" and that Crowhurst is "west of it," indicating a clear
        directional difference between the locations. The NO is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Crowhurst is NOT east of Coxheath. The answer
        is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    c28f76c7-5881-4047-a3cc-06233df53710:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - it explicitly states that Coxheath is east-northeast of
        Crowhurst, indicating a clear directional difference between their positions.
        The NO is because their relative positions are opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Crowhurst is not east
        of Coxheath" and provides a definitive comparative result, explaining that
        "Coxheath is east of Crowhurst."
      final_answer: 'NO'

    c84c480e-53a0-4938-8e7d-b8233545868a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Crowhurst is "southwest of
        Coxheath" and provides this directional difference as the reason for its NO
        answer. Even though this is a clear NO answer, it's based on a directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the geographical positions of both locations.
        The answer directly addresses the comparative question of whether Crowhurst
        is east of Coxheath.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d498bdb2-1ba3-4eef-96a1-1ece6cea0278:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Crowhurst lies to the west
        of Coxheath, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on
        Crowhurst being west of Coxheath, not on the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, indicating that Crowhurst is not east of Coxheath. The answer is explicit
        and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    da01c1f7-7bec-4ee8-823e-b8908a19ee93:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Crowhurst is positioned west
        of Coxheath, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Crowhurst,
        East Sussex is not located east of Coxheath" as its final answer. This is
        a direct comparative answer without any caveats about uncertainty or inability
        to determine.

        W). The NO answer appears to be based on this difference in position, not\
        \ on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model concluded with a clear "NO" at the end of
        its response after analyzing the locations. This appears to be a direct answer

        Instead, it explicitly states that Magor is located to the east of Craven
        Arms, but gives NO as the final answer (which appears to contradict its own
        analysis). While this seems illogical, we must evaluate based on what was
        stated, not what makes sense.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the locations are "approximately
        at the same longitude," it also explicitly states that "Kalaburagi is very
        slightly east of Thondamuthur" and "possibly being very slightly east." Since
        the model indicates there is a slight difference (even if tiny), rather than
        stating they are exactly equal, this does not qualify as a NO due to equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Kalaburagi district
        is not definitively located east of Thondamuthur" as its final answer. While
        there is some uncertainty in the explanation, the model gives a clear NO as
        its comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, saying Kalaburagi is to the west of Thondamuthur.
        The NO is based on the opposite direction being true, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes that "Kalaburagi district is located to the west
        of Thondamuthur, not to the east." This is a direct comparative answer to
        the question.

        there is a directional difference, saying Kalaburagi is west of Thondamuthur.
        The NO answer was given because the model determined one location is west
        of the other, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Kalaburagi
        district is not located east of Thondamuthur" and confirms this by stating
        "It is located west of Thondamuthur." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the locations have "very
        similar longitudes" and are "roughly on the same north-south line," it also
        mentions that "Montserrado County possibly being slightly further west." Since
        it indicates there might be a slight difference (even if tiny), this doesn't
        qualify as stating they are exactly equal as the primary reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations. The answer
        is clear and direct.

    f3698c8b-cab4-4ff5-9d35-ba6aad5e5da6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Hougang is east
        of North Region, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO is based on the opposite relationship being true (Hougang being east
        of North Region) rather than the locations being at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (North Region
        is not located east of Hougang; rather, Hougang is east of North Region)".
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ff63281b-2137-40f8-bfd4-4b0a1a9f2e56:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying that North Region is "west of Hougang" and Hougang is "east of the
        North Region." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO - North
        Region, Singapore is not located east of Hougang" twice in its response, providing
        a direct comparative answer.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions due to uncertainty about which specific locations were being referenced.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, I cannot confirm that Carthage
        (municipality) is east of Prestine based on the available information." This
        is a statement indicating inability to determine the relationship, not a comparative
        result. The model explicitly states it cannot determine the locations and
        their relative positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (north/northeast rather than east). Even though these might be
        nearby locations, any stated directional difference means we must classify
        this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO - Bagha Upazila
        is located to the north/northeast of Mahishadal, not east of it." This is
        a clear NO answer comparing the relative positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with Corley being west of Boldre. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" at the end of
        its response, indicating that Corley is not east of Boldre (it states Corley
        is west of Boldre)

        state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states
        that Corley is west of Boldre, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        is based on the opposite being true (Corley being west of Boldre), not because
        the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer, indicating that Corley is not east of Boldre. The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different - specifically that Corley is west of Boldre, not
        that they are at the same location. The model explicitly states "Corley in
        the West Midlands is west of Boldre in Hampshire" as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after analyzing

      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially suggests the locations are
        at "almost the same longitude," it ultimately states that Bida is "possibly
        being slightly to the east of Morez." Since it identifies a directional difference
        (even if slight), this is not a case where the NO answer is based on equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Morez is east of Bida. This is a clear comparative answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model states "their longitudes are very similar"
        and concludes they are "approximately at the same longitude, with Morez slightly
        to the west." Since it mentions a slight directional difference (west), even
        though tiny, this does not qualify as stating they are exactly equal as the
        primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Morez is

        Since it identifies a directional difference (even if tiny), this is not a
        case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Morez is not located

        east of Leknes, as I don't have information about a place called Lig." This
        is a case where the model is saying it cannot determine the answer due to
        lack of information about one of the locations, making this an UNKNOWN response
        rather than a definitive NO comparative answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    abae076d-1f36-4d0e-bffc-2a7a4484b6f2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't establish
        one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" because it cannot verify the location of Lig. This indicates
        it cannot make the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply couldn't verify
        one location's existence.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does say "NO" at the end, it immediately
        clarifies that this is because it "cannot confirm" or "verify" the location
        of Lig. This makes it clear that the model is indicating it cannot make the
        comparison, which falls under our UNKNOWN criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" because it cannot verify the location of Lig. This is a
        case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information about one of the locations.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't identify
        one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot confirm that Lig is
        east of Leknes because I cannot identify 'Lig' as a known location." This
        is a case where the model is saying it cannot determine the comparison because
        one location cannot be verified to exist, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria ("The model rejects the premises of the question").
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        Lig's location at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot confirm that Lig is
        east of Leknes based on available information." This is a case where the model
        indicates it cannot determine the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN rather
        than a NO comparative result. The explanation makes it clear that the answer
        is NO because the model cannot verify the location, not because it determined
        Lig is not east of Leknes.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and provides
        a clear comparative result, explaining that while Beckenham has a slight easterly
        component, it would be inaccurate to describe it as being "east of Canary
        Wharf" since its primary directional relationship is southward.

        The NO answer is based on a directional difference (west vs east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        is west of Skipwith. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO. Based on
        the geographical coordinates, Horndean is not east of Skipwith." While there
        is some confusion in the response (it contradicts itself about which is slightly
        east/west), it clearly ends with a definitive NO answer to the comparison

        the relative position. While it says "NO", this NO is followed by an explanation
        that invalidates the comparison itself, making this a rejection of the premise
        rather than a comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        didn't give a NO answer based on equal values - it actually indicated it couldn't
        make the comparison at all because one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO - I cannot confirm..."
        and rejects the premise because one location doesn't exist. This is a case
        where the model is saying it cannot determine the comparison because one location
        doesn't exist, which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

    91133d36-adda-4a69-8e77-502ec0e00640:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Additionally, the model's reasoning
        was not based on equal values, but rather on the non-existence of one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is based on rejecting the premise that one of the locations exists
        ("Since Slab City, Wisconsin does not exist, it cannot be located east").
        When a model rejects the premises of the question, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN per the instructions.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Slab
        City is northwest of Lomira, not because the locations are equal/same. It
        explicitly states there is a directional difference (northwest vs east)
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Slab
        City, Wisconsin is not located east of Lomira, Wisconsin" and provides a definitive
        comparative result (northwest instead of east)

        state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states
        that Slab City is northwest of Lomira, indicating a clear directional difference.
        The NO is based on Slab City being west/northwest of Lomira, not because the
        locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer, indicating that Slab City is not east of Lomira. The
        model provides specific geographic reasoning and ends with a direct "NO" response.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated one location doesn't appear to exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot confirm" and explains
        this is because one location doesn't appear to exist. This is a case where
        the model rejects the premises of the question by indicating one location
        doesn't exist, which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that Slab City is
        not east of Lomira (specifically stating it is northwest instead).

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it determined NO based on Coligny being west of Stepan
        (for at least one interpretation), which indicates a difference in position.
        Even when discussing the Ukraine possibility, it noted that positions "may
        overlap" but still gave NO based on the other interpretation showing a difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were at the same longitude. Instead, it explicitly indicated
        that Botley is west of Potto's longitude line, noting a difference in their
        positions (with Potto being "more easterly"). The NO is based on this directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer after analyzing the east-west positions of both locations.
        The answer is definitive and comparative.

        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Botley, Hampshire is
        not located east of Potto, North Yorkshire. It is actually west of Potto."
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        that the locations were at the same longitude/position. Instead, it explicitly
        stated that Potto is east of Botley, indicating a difference in their positions.
        The NO answer was given because Potto is east of Botley, not because they
        are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Botley is east of Potto, and provides this as a comparative

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Carrickalinga is southwest of Laura, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer was based on Carrickalinga being west
        (not east) of Laura, not because they were at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"

        between their positions. The NO is based on Carrickalinga being in the opposite
        direction (west) from what was asked (east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer to whether Carrickalinga is located east of Laura. The

        locations are in different positions, with Carrickalinga being west of Laura.
        The model does not state or suggest the locations are at the same longitude
        - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Carrickalinga
        is west of Laura). Therefore, the NO is not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"

        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Clacton-on-Sea is further east than Scole, with Scole being located to the
        west of Clacton-on-Sea. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, explicitly stating that Scole is located to the west of Clacton-on-Sea,
        not to the east.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a difference in position, with Clacton-on-Sea being further east
        (on the coast) and Scole being more inland (to the west). The NO is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer, stating that "Scole is NOT east of Clacton-on-Sea, but
        rather to the west of it." This is a direct comparative answer to the question

        positions. The NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Scole
        is not located east of Clacton-on-Sea" and provides a specific reason (Clacton-on-Sea
        is further east as it's on the coastline).

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Scole is "northwest of" Clacton-on-Sea
        and provides directional differences. The NO answer is based on Scole being
        in a different position (to the northwest), not because the locations are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Scole is not east of Clacton-on-Sea. The answer
