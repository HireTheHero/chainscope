      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "Crowhurst, East Sussex, is generally west
        or southwest of Coxheath, Kent, not east." This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.

        for its NO answer, stating that "Sijarinska Banja is not located directly
        east, but rather south or southeast of Toplica District." This indicates a
        directional difference (south/southeast vs. east) as the reason for the NO

        difference (south/southeast rather than east) as the reason for its NO answer,
        not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Sijarinska Banja

        in the conclusion. The model determined that Sahiwal District is slightly
        to the west of Bhivpuri, not east, and therefore answered "NO" to the comparative
        question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Boundary Bend is
        west of Richmond, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The model's reasoning indicates that the locations have different longitudinal
        positions, with Boundary Bend being "definitely west of Richmond." This difference
        in position is the reason for the NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Boundary Bend, Victoria located east of Richmond, Queensland?"
        The model clearly concludes that "Boundary Bend (in western Victoria) is definitely
        west of Richmond (in Queensland)" and then provides a direct "NO" answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
