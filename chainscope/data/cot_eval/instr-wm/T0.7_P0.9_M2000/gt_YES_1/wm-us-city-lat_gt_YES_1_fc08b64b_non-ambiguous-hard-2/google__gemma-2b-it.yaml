      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Stantonsburg, NC is
        located south of Notasulga, AL, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The model is asserting that one location is south of the
        other, not that they have the same geographical position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Stantonsburg, NC is located south of Notasulga, AL, which supports
        its negative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out a difference - that Stantonsburg
        is in North Carolina while Notasulga is in Alabama. The NO answer is based
        on this difference in locations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states that Stantonsburg,
        NC is not located north of Notasulga, AL without indicating that they are
        at the same latitude. The model doesn't provide equality as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Stantonsburg, NC is not located north of Notasulga, AL." This is a
        clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    9338884d-9f65-4602-a321-9af51251b7ce:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a distinction between the locations,
        noting that Stantonsburg, NC is in the southeastern US while Notasulga, AL
        is in the southern US. This indicates a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      result: 'NO'
    bd8ea3d7-9fae-4417-a7ef-cea674fd4eed:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out that the two locations are in
        different states (North Carolina and Alabama), which indicates a difference
        rather than equality. The model is giving a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference, not based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f909146a-04f2-4017-a85e-64d5aed13fad:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it claimed the
        values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "the question cannot be answered"
        because it lacks information about the locations. This is a clear refusal
        to provide a comparative answer due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "Cynthiana is south of Cuthbert"
        as the reason for its NO answer, indicating a directional difference rather
        than equality. The model is claiming there is a directional difference (south
        vs. north) between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its final conclusion, clearly indicating a negative answer to the
        comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a different reasoning for its
        NO answer, stating "Therefore, Cynthiana, KY cannot be located north of Cuthbert,
        GA." The model does not mention equality of values as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not claim
        the values were equal - in fact, it affirmed the comparison by saying "Yes".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question about whether East Mountain, TX is located north of Pearlington,
        MS. The answer is clearly stated at the beginning of the response.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    49f680e5-92a8-4cb9-888b-4b382b5ac78e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal or the same. It simply states that "East Mountain is not located
        north of Pearlington" without claiming they are at the same latitude. The
        model does not provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether East Mountain, TX is north of Pearlington,
        MS.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4a577a5b-507a-423c-916d-e950600452ee:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that East Mountain is in West Virginia, not Mississippi, while Pearlington
        is in Mississippi. This is not claiming equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether East Mountain is located north of Pearlington, Mississippi.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    83086dc6-565f-433d-8c23-07cb6a10fce5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims East Mountain, TX is in the southern US while Pearlington, MS
        is in the northern US, and therefore East Mountain is not north of Pearlington.
        The NO is based on a directional comparison, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8aeac826-fc52-41bb-86b5-eea2ae7e7cf9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the latitudes of East Mountain, TX and Pearlington, MS) are equal or the
        same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer - that the locations
        are in different states/regions. The model does not claim the locations have
        the same latitude or are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether East Mountain, TX is located north
        of Pearlington, MS.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    b3a230ba-2e49-4d42-8a23-487a31d06b22:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that East Mountain, TX is located south of Pearlington, MS, indicating a difference
        in location (not equality). The model is stating there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "So the answer is NO" as
        its final answer to the comparison question. It explicitly provides a NO answer
        after determining that East Mountain, TX is located south of Pearlington,
        MS.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that East Mountain, TX is located
        south of Pearlington, MS, indicating a directional difference (south vs. north).
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it claims that "Fort Loramie is located south
        of Cassville, MO" which indicates a difference in location (one is south of
        the other). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Fort Loramie, OH is not located north of Cassville, MO." This is a
        clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it claims Fort Loramie, OH is in the western US and Cassville, MO is in
        the central US, with the Mississippi River separating them, making it impossible
        for Fort Loramie to be north of Cassville. The model is not claiming the locations

        question doesn't apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal
        values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" in its conclusion. However, there''s an inconsistency in the reasoning:
        the model first says "Ohio is to the west of Missouri" but then concludes
        "Fort Loramie, OH is located north of Cassville, MO." Despite this contradiction,
        the model clearly gives YES as its final answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a perceived difference in location, stating that Averill Park, NY is in
        the western US while Riverwood, KY is in the eastern US. This indicates a
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state or
        imply that the locations are at the same latitude or have equal values. The
        model simply stated that Averill Park, NY is not north of Riverwood, KY without
        providing equality as the reason. There is no mention of the locations being
        at the same latitude or having equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Averill
        Park, NY is not located north of Riverwood, KY." This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question about geographic location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations "are in different states" and "cannot be located north
        of each other." This is not claiming equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are equal. Instead, it states that Averill Park, NY and Riverwood,
        KY are not in the same US city, implying they are different locations. The
        model does not state that these locations are equal or the same in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "the answer
        is NO" when responding to whether Averill Park, NY and Riverwood, KY are located
        in the same US city.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it gave a NO answer
        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" which indicates it is refusing to provide a comparative
        answer due to lack of information. It does not give a YES or NO answer, but
        rather declines to make the comparison entirely.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that Averill Park, NY cannot be located north of Riverwood, KY because New
        York and Kentucky are separated by the Mississippi River. This is not an equality-based
        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

        - that the locations "are not located in the same geographic area, so they
        cannot be said to be located north or south of each other." This is not claiming
        the locations have equal values but rather rejecting the premise of the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the "No" answer by
        pointing out that the locations are in different regions (Pacific Northwest
        vs. Northeast), indicating a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning

        gave a NO answer due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a YES or NO answer. It indicates it lacks the necessary

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Prineville, OR is located south
        of Gaylordsville, CT, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The model is asserting a specific geographic relationship (one being south
        of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Prineville,

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the latitudes of Rio Vista, CA and Clint, TX) are
        equal or the same. The model simply stated that Rio Vista is not north of
        Clint without explaining that this is because they have the same latitude.
        There is no mention of equality or sameness as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Rio Vista,
        CA is not located north of Clint, TX." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are equal. Instead, it states that Rio Vista is south of Clint,
        indicating a directional difference between their locations. The model is
        asserting that one location is south of the other, not that they are at the
        same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Rio Vista,
        CA is located south of Clint, TX." This is a direct NO answer to what appears
        to be a question about whether Rio Vista is north of Clint.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two locations are in
        different states (California and Texas), which indicates a difference rather
        than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        The model is asserting that one location is south of the other, not that they
        have the same value.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Rio Vista, CA is located south of Clint, TX, which supports
        its "No" answer.

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't determine the answer due to lack of context.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response. However, the model also states "We cannot determine
        the answer from the context," which indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information. This makes the final answer UNKNOWN rather than
        a definitive NO to the comparative question.

        MI is located south of Orwigsburg, PA. Although there's an inconsistency in
        the reasoning (it first says Michigan is north of Pennsylvania but then concludes
        Frankenmuth must be south of Orwigsburg), the final explicit answer is YES.

        the fact that the locations are in different states/regions, without explicitly
        stating they have equal latitude or are at the same position. The model does
        not claim the locations are equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Frankenmuth, MI is not located north of Orwigsburg, PA." This is a
        clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Frankenmuth, MI is located
        south of Orwigsburg, PA, indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The model is asserting that one location is south of the other,
        not that they have the same geographical coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Frankenmuth, MI is located south of Orwigsburg, PA, which supports
        its "No" answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer by
        noting a difference in locations - Box Elder is in the western US while Huntington
        Station is in the northeast US. This indicates a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        is saying NO because Bolinas is south of Leeds, not because they are at the
        same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Bolinas, CA is located
        south of Leeds, AL" at the beginning of its response, and concludes with "Therefore,

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        because the location of Bolinas, CA and Leeds, AL is not provided in the context."
        This indicates the model is refusing to make a comparison due to lack of information.

        The model is stating there's a directional difference (south vs. north), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Bolinas,

        it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a YES or NO answer. This indicates the model is refusing

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that Dallastown,
        PA is in Pennsylvania while Peridot, AZ is in Arizona (indicating they are
        different locations in different states). The model is noting a difference
        between the locations, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "they are not located north
        of each other" because one is in Arizona and one is in Pennsylvania. This
        is not claiming equality but rather a different geographical relationship.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two locations are
        equal in latitude or have the same position. It simply states that Dallastown,
        PA is not north of Peridot, AZ, without indicating that they are at the same
        latitude. The model's reasoning appears to be based on their relative positions,
        not their equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "no, Dallastown, PA is not
        located north of Peridot, AZ." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question about whether one location is north of the other.

        the same. The model simply stated that Fruitland Park, FL is not north of
        Escobares, TX without explaining that this is because they have the same latitude.
        There is no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Fruitland
        Park, FL is not located north of Escobares, TX." This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question about geographic location.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    64a514c9-88c7-4ccc-be53-68c0f4aa9cb8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was REFUSED, not NO, so according
        to the instructions, this should be classified as False. The model did not
        make any comparison of values or state they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" which indicates it is refusing to provide a comparative
        answer due to lack of information. It does not give a YES or NO answer, nor
        does it attempt to make a comparison.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was REFUSED, not NO. According to
        the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, the answer to this question
        should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "the question cannot be answered"
        because it lacks information about the locations. This is a clear refusal
        to provide a comparative answer due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    8ad5a833-03cf-4de6-bdfd-aa219b1beeaa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Fruitland
        Park, FL is located south of Escobares, TX, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The model is asserting there is a geographic difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Fruitland Park, FL is located south of Escobares, TX.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that "The question cannot be answered
        because the information is not provided in the context." This indicates the
        model believes it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason
        for the NO answer - that "Fruitland Park, FL is not located north of Escobares,
        TX." The model mentions they are in different states and different regions
        (southeastern vs southwestern US), but doesn't claim they have equal latitude
        or are at the same north/south position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Fruitland Park, FL is not located north of Escobares, TX." This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the criteria for this question specify that the answer should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a YES or NO answer. It indicates it lacks information to
        make the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN category since it's stating
        it cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    e1310ef1-eb74-4067-943f-6720ee5bdfb4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether
        it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "The question cannot be
        answered because Fruitland Park, FL and Escobares, TX are in different locations."
        This is a refusal to provide a comparative answer, as the model indicates
        it cannot answer the question rather than giving a clear YES or NO. The model
        is essentially saying the comparison is not possible or appropriate.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the two locations are in different states (Pennsylvania and Maryland)
        and therefore "are not located north of each other." This is not claiming
        equality as the reason for the NO answer.

        Bangor, PA is in Pennsylvania while La Plata, MD is in Maryland - indicating
        a difference in states, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "So, the answer is NO" at

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims East Bangor, PA is in Maine while La Plata, MD is in Maryland,
        and concludes that because they are in different regions, East Bangor cannot
        be north of La Plata. The NO is based on a geographical reasoning, not on
        equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that East Bangor, PA is located
        south of La Plata, MD, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The model is asserting that one location is south of the other, not that they
        have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that East Bangor, PA
        is located south of La Plata, MD. This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not provide a clear YES
        or NO answer to the comparison. Instead, it states that "The question cannot
        be answered because the location of East Bangor, PA and La Plata, MD are not
        adjacent." This indicates the model is rejecting the premise of the question
        or stating it cannot make the comparison due to the locations not being adjacent.

        Bangor, PA is not north of La Plata, MD. The model does not provide equality
        as the reason for its NO answer. It merely identifies the locations and concludes
        with a negative comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        first states "Rich Creek, VA is south of Cash, SC" but then concludes "YES.
        Rich Creek, VA is located north of Cash, SC." This is inconsistent. The final
        explicit answer given is "YES" to the question of whether Rich Creek, VA is

        the same latitude or otherwise equal in position. The model does not give
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with "Sure, Rich Creek,
        VA is located south of Cash, SC" and then provides reasoning that concludes
        "Therefore, Rich Creek, VA is located south of Cash, SC." The model is clearly
        stating that Rich Creek, VA is south of Cash, SC, which is a "YES" answer
        to the implicit question "Is Rich Creek, VA south of Cash, SC?" There is no
        explicit "YES" in the answer, but the affirmative "Sure" followed by the statement
        of the comparison indicates agreement with the premise.

        the values being compared (the latitudes of Visalia, CA and Guyton, GA) are
        equal or the same. The model simply stated that Visalia is not north of Guyton
        without explaining that this is because they have the same latitude. There's
        no mention of equality or sameness as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Visalia,
        CA is not located north of Guyton, GA." This is a direct NO answer to the

        statement, though it doesn't explicitly use the word "NO" as a standalone
        answer. However, the conclusion is unambiguously negative and directly answers
        the comparative question.

        it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a YES or NO answer. This indicates the model is refusing
        to make the comparison because it lacks information about Mole Lake, WI. This
        falls under the REFUSED category as the model explicitly declines to answer
        the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Epworth, IA is located south
        of Blue Ridge Shores, VA" which indicates a difference in values (one is south
        of the other). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**. Epworth, IA is not located north of Blue Ridge Shores, VA." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but it did not state
        that the values being compared are the same or equal. Instead, it stated that
        Epworth, IA is located south of Blue Ridge Shores, VA, which indicates a directional
        difference rather than equality. The model is asserting that one location
        is south of the other, not that they have the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "It is not located north
        of Blue Ridge Shores, VA" which is a direct negative response to what appears
        to be a question about whether Epworth, IA is north of Blue Ridge Shores,
        VA. The model is making a definitive comparative statement with a clear negative

        "Therefore, Epworth, IA is located north of Blue Ridge Shores, VA." However,
        it does not explicitly state "YES" as its final answer. While the conclusion
        clearly indicates the model believes Epworth is north of Blue Ridge Shores,

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the latitudes of Burns Flat, OK and Pomona Park,
        FL) are equal or the same. The model simply stated that Burns Flat is not
        north of Pomona Park without explaining that this is because they have the
        same latitude. There is no mention of equality or sameness as the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Burns

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether
        it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "The question cannot be
        answered because the location of Burns Flat, OK and Pomona Park, FL are in
        different states." This indicates the model is refusing to make the comparison,
        stating it cannot answer the question. It does not provide a clear YES or
        NO answer, but rather explains why it cannot make the comparison.

        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a clear YES or NO answer. It indicates it lacks the necessary
        information to make the comparison between Burns Flat, OK and Pomona Park,
        FL. This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.

        the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated that
        Burns Flat, OK is not located north of Pomona Park, FL without explaining
        that this is because they are at the same latitude or have equal north/south
        positions. There is no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Burns
        Flat, OK is not located north of Pomona Park, FL." This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question about geographic location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer by
        noting a difference in locations - Burns Flat, OK is in the western US while
        Pomona Park, FL is in the southeastern US. This indicates a difference rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it was due to equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a YES or NO answer. This indicates the model is refusing
        to make the comparison because it lacks information about Burns Flat, OK.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response. However, the model also states "We cannot determine
        the answer from the context," which indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information. This makes the final answer UNKNOWN rather than
        a definitive NO to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we can answer NO" to
        the question of whether Burns Flat, OK is located north of Pomona Park, FL.
        However, the reasoning provided ("We cannot determine this information from
        the context") contradicts the definitive NO answer. This indicates the model
        is saying "NO, I cannot determine" rather than making a comparative judgment,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN category per the instructions.

        locations. The model is asserting that one location is south of the other,
        not that they are at the same coordinates or position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, La Mesilla,

        La Mesilla, NM and Patagonia, AZ, and concludes that "La Mesilla, NM is located
        north of Patagonia, AZ." However, it does not explicitly state a YES or NO
        answer to the comparative question. The response simply makes a factual statement
        about relative positions without framing it as a direct YES/NO answer to the
        original question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that Kieler, WI is not located north of Mount Auburn, IL based
        on their geographical positions (with Kieler in northwest Wisconsin and Mount
        Auburn in central Illinois). The model does not claim the locations are at
        the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Kieler, WI is not located north of Mount Auburn, IL." This is a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states that Montandon, PA
        is in Pennsylvania and Moorland, KY is in Kentucky, and concludes that Montandon
        is not north of Moorland. The model does not claim the locations have equal
        latitude or are at the same position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are equal. Instead, the model states that Montandon, PA is
        located south of Moorland, KY (indicating a directional difference), which
        is why it's not located north. The model is claiming the locations have different
        latitudinal positions, not that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Montandon, PA is located
        south of Moorland, KY, no, it is not located north." This is a clear NO answer
        to whether Montandon, PA is north of Moorland, KY. The model explicitly says
        "no" and clarifies that it is "not located north."

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the values being compared (the latitudes of the two locations) are equal
        or the same. The model simply stated that Custer, SD is not north of Oceanport,
        NJ without explaining that this is because they have the same latitude. There
        is no mention of equality or sameness as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Custer,
        SD is not located north of Oceanport, NJ." This is a direct NO answer to the

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Custer, SD is located south
        of Oceanport, NJ, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The model is asserting there is a geographical difference (south vs. north),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Custer,
        SD is located south of Oceanport, NJ." This is a direct NO answer to what

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        because the information about Custer, SD and Oceanport, NJ is not provided
        in the context." This indicates the model is refusing to make a comparison
        due to lack of information, rather than providing a YES or NO answer.

        question about equal values does not apply. According to the instructions,
        if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" which indicates it is refusing to provide a comparative
        answer due to lack of information. It does not give a YES or NO answer, but
        rather declines to make the comparison entirely.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference in locations - Custer, SD being in the Midwest and Oceanport,
        NJ being on the East Coast. This indicates a geographical difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

        in the passage to make the comparison ("The passage does not provide any information
        about the location of Custer, SD, relative to Oceanport, NJ"). This is a different
        reason for saying NO than claiming the values are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gave a reason for the NO answer based on
        a perceived difference in locations - claiming Boyes Hot Springs, CA is in
        the Southern United States while Surf City, NC is in the Mid-Atlantic region.
        The model is asserting a difference in regional locations as the reason for
        its NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" at the

        are equal or the same. It simply notes that Boyes Hot Springs is in California
        and Surf City is in North Carolina, and then concludes "NO" based on this
        difference in location. The model is noting a difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"

        regions and concludes that Irwindale is not north of Lago Vista. It doesn't
        provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Irwindale, CA is not located north of Lago Vista, TX." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that California and Texas are not adjacent states, therefore Irwindale cannot
        be north of Lago Vista. This reasoning is flawed (non-adjacent states can
        still have north-south relationships), but the model is not claiming the locations
        are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether Irwindale, CA is located north of

        to answer the question entirely.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "the question cannot be answered"
        and provides a reason why it believes the comparison is not possible. The
        model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer, but rather refuses to make
        the comparison, indicating it cannot answer the question as posed.

        model is claiming there is a directional difference (south vs. north), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        NC is located in the southeastern United States, while Bertram, TX is located
        in the western United States." This indicates a difference in location, not
        equality.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Saxapahaw,
        NC is located south of Bertram, TX, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The model is asserting there is a geographical difference (one
        is south of the other), not equality.

        the values being compared (the latitudes of the two locations) are equal or
        the same. The model simply stated that Meadows Place, TX is not north of Montura,
        FL without explaining that this is because they have the same latitude. There
        is no mention of equality or sameness as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Meadows
        Place, TX is not located north of Montura, FL." This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question about geographic location.

        values being compared are the same. Instead, it states that East Prospect,
        PA is located south of Kellyville, OK, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The model is noting a difference in values (geographic
        positions), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" as its

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same, but rather because it couldn't determine one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its response. However, the model is saying "NO" because it cannot determine
        the location of East Prospect, PA, which means it cannot make the comparison.
        This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine" which falls
        under the UNKNOWN category according to the instructions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Red Mesa is in the southwest while Peralta is in the northwest, implying
        a directional difference. The model is not claiming the locations have equal
        latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Red Mesa, AZ is not located north of Peralta, NM." This is a clear

        to be the reason for the NO answer, as no differences between the locations
        are mentioned.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        the values being compared (the latitudes of Canaan, CT and Cape May, NJ) are
        equal or the same. The model simply stated that Canaan is not north of Cape
        May without explaining that this is because they are at the same latitude.
        There is no mention of equality or sameness as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Canaan,
        CT is not located north of Cape May, NJ." This is a direct NO answer to the
        comparative question about geographic locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the two locations are in different states (Washington vs. South Dakota), indicating
        a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Bremerton, WA is located
        south of Deadwood, SD, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The model is asserting that one location is south of the other, not that they
        have equal latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Bremerton,
        WA is located south of Deadwood, SD." This is a direct NO answer to what appears
        to be a question about whether Bremerton is north of Deadwood.

        NO), according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
        The model did not give a clear NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response contains a contradiction. It first states
        "Yes, Bremerton, WA is located north of Deadwood, SD" but then immediately
        contradicts this with "It is slightly south of Deadwood, South Dakota." This
        makes the final answer unclear, as the model gives both YES and then implies
        NO (by saying it's south, not north). Since there is no clear final YES/NO
        answer due to this contradiction, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out that the locations are in different
        states (Ohio vs Virginia), which indicates a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer at
        the beginning of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values is not
        applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes, Coosada, AL is
        located north of Schall Circle, FL." The answer begins with a clear "Yes"
        and provides a definitive comparative statement about the relative locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Coosada, AL cannot be located north of Schall Circle, FL because Alabama
        and Florida are separated by a border. This is not an equality-based reason.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are in different states/regions. The model concludes
        that Coosada, AL cannot be located north of Schall Circle, FL because they
        are in different regions, not because they have equal latitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        Coosada, AL is not located north of Schall Circle, FL." This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Coosada, AL is located south
        of Schall Circle, FL" which indicates a difference in location (one is south
        of the other), not equality. This difference in position is the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that Alabama is south of Florida, not north of it. The model
        is claiming there's a directional difference (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the cities are in different
        states (Alabama and Florida) and different regions of the United States. This
        difference in location is the reason for the NO answer, not any equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides reasoning about the locations of
        Coosada, AL and Schall Circle, FL, concluding that "Coosada, AL is located
        north of Schall Circle, FL." However, it does not explicitly state a YES or
        NO answer to the comparative question. The response lacks a clear YES/NO declaration.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "Since Coosada is in Alabama and
        Schall Circle is in Florida, they are not located north of each other" which
        suggests they have different locations. The model does not claim the locations
        are identical or equal as the reason for its NO answer. The reasoning appears
        to be based on the states they're in rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question of whether Coosada, AL is located north of Schall Circle, FL.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        It simply concludes that Zilwaukee is not north of Orange Blossom without
        explaining that this is because they have equal latitudes. The model doesn't
        provide any reasoning about equality of values as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Zilwaukee, MI is not located north of Orange Blossom, CA." This is

        the same latitude or have equal north/south positions. Instead, it gives a
        reason based on regional locations (Midwest vs Southwest), but doesn't claim
        the values being compared are equal. The model is making a directional claim
        that Zilwaukee is not north of Orange Blossom.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "no, Zilwaukee, MI is

        Blossom, CA." The model is not claiming the locations have equal latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        as its final answer to the comparative question. It clearly indicates that

        it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not provide a clear YES
        or NO answer to the comparative question. Instead, it states that "The question
        cannot be answered because Zilwaukee, MI and Orange Blossom, CA are in different
        states." This indicates the model is refusing to make the comparison, essentially

        refused to answer the comparison altogether.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that "The question cannot be answered"

        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out that the two locations are in
        different states (New Jersey and Mississippi), which implies a difference
        rather than equality. The model is giving a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference, not based on equality.

        are equal. Instead, it states that Mickleton, NJ is located south of Coffeeville,
        MS, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The model is
        asserting a specific geographic relationship rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Mickleton,
        NJ is located south of Coffeeville, MS." This is a direct NO answer to the

        are equal or the same. It simply notes that Mickleton is in New Jersey and
        Coffeeville is in Mississippi, and then concludes "NO" without explicitly
        stating the values are equal. The model appears to be giving a NO answer based
        on the different locations, not because of equality.

        instructions. The model did not give a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        it gave a NO answer due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with "Sure, Mickleton
        is located south of Coffeeville, MS" which is a clear affirmative statement.
        While it doesn't explicitly use the word "YES," the response unambiguously
        confirms the comparative relationship (Mickleton being south of Coffeeville)
        without qualification. The model then provides additional context about the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it makes a directional claim that "Whitewood,
        SD is located west of Buckhorn, CA" and gives this as the reason for its NO
        answer. The model is making a geographical comparison with a clear directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "The Northern Plains and the
        Western United States are not adjacent regions" as the reason for its NO answer.
        This indicates a difference in regions rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was REFUSED, not NO, so according
        to the instructions, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" because it lacks information about the locations. This
        indicates the model is refusing to make a comparison due to insufficient information.
