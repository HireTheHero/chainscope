      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional statement that "Alabama
        is to the east of North Carolina" as the reason for its NO answer. This indicates
        a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" at the end of its response, making it clear that its final answer
        is YES.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't make the determination without a map.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" but it immediately
        qualifies this with "(We need a map to confirm this)" which indicates it cannot
        determine the answer without additional information. This makes it clear the
        model is not providing a definitive comparative result but rather stating
        it cannot verify the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: 'The model''s response ends with "**Answer: NO** (We
        need a map to confirm this)." The model gives a NO answer but immediately
        qualifies it by saying it needs a map to confirm. This indicates uncertainty
        and an inability to make a definitive determination without additional information.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is essentially saying
        "NO, I cannot verify" without the necessary information.'

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "we cannot definitively answer this
        question" without providing a clear YES or NO answer. It acknowledges it doesn't
        have the necessary information (a map) to make the comparison between the
        locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that Stantonsburg, NC
        and Notasulga, AL are in different states, and then concludes with NO without
        explicitly stating they are at the same latitude or have equal north/south
        positions. The model doesn't provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        being compared (the locations of Stantonsburg, NC and Notasulga, AL) are equal
        or the same. It simply states "NO" without explaining that the locations are
        at the same latitude or have equal north/south positions. The model doesn't
        provide any specific reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating "Cuthbert is to the west of Cynthiana." This indicates
        a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. It simply concludes that Cynthiana, KY is not located
        north of Cuthbert, GA without specifying that this is because the locations
        are identical or equal. The model doesn't provide the specific reason for
        its NO answer in terms of equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states "NO" without
        providing any reasoning about equality or similarity between the locations.
        There is no mention of the locations having the same latitude or being at
        equal distances from the equator.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; rather
        it indicated it couldn't make the determination without a map.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" but it immediately
        qualifies this with "(We need a map to confirm this)" which indicates it cannot
        determine the answer without additional information. This is effectively saying
        "NO, I cannot verify" which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations of Cynthiana, KY and Cuthbert, GA) are equal or the same. It
        does not mention equality as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it states
        that it doesn't have a map to determine the relative locations, and therefore
        concludes with NO. The lack of information, not equality of values, is the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that "Pearlington, MS is in the northeast
        part of Mississippi, while East Mountain, TX is in the southwest part of Texas,"
        indicating a difference in locations. The NO answer appears to be based on
        this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the locations of East Mountain,
        TX and Pearlington, MS.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that "Texas is to the south of Mississippi"
        which indicates a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for
        the NO answer, stating "Texas is in the south of Mississippi" which implies
        a directional difference rather than equality. The model does not claim the
        locations have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't provide any specific reason
        for the NO answer related to equality of positions. The explanation simply
        walks through how to determine north/south relationships but doesn't conclude
        with any statement about equal latitudes or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what amounts to an UNKNOWN answer because it lacked information to make the
        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" but it immediately
        qualifies this with "(We need a map to confirm this)" which indicates it cannot
        determine the answer. This is a case where the model is saying it cannot verify
        or determine the comparison without additional information (a map), making
        this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states "Texas is to the south of Mississippi" which implies a directional
        difference (not equality) between the locations. The model is saying NO because
        the directional relationship is opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - stating that "Texas is to the south of Mississippi" which contradicts what
        would be needed for the comparison to be true. The model is not claiming equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; rather,
        it indicated it couldn't determine the answer due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        but it clarifies in parentheses that "we cannot confirm this based on the
        given information." This indicates the model is saying it cannot determine
        the answer due to insufficient information, not that the comparison is false.

        According to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, the answer
        to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give you a definitive
        YES or NO answer" after explaining that it cannot access a map to check the

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; rather
        it indicated it couldn't make the determination without a map.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" but it immediately
        qualifies this with "(We need a map to confirm this)" which indicates it cannot
        determine the answer. This is a case where the model is saying it cannot verify
        or determine the comparison without additional information (a map), making
        this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the latitudes of Larned, KS and Bruce, MS) are equal or the same. Instead,
        it states "NO" because it claims to need a map to confirm the relative positions.
        The reason for the NO is uncertainty about the comparison, not equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" followed by a parenthetical
        explanation that "We need a map to confirm this." While the model expresses
        uncertainty about the comparison, it explicitly provides "NO" as its final
        answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine the
        answer.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; rather
        it indicated it couldn't make the determination without a map.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" followed by a parenthetical
        explanation that "We need a map to confirm this." This indicates the model
        is saying NO because it cannot determine the answer without additional information
        (a map), not as a comparative result. This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        since the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison without more information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply notes that the locations are
        in different states and mentions latitude and longitude as key factors, but
        doesn't explicitly state that they have equal values as the reason for the
        NO answer.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; rather
        it indicated it couldn't make the determination without a map.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" but it immediately
        qualifies this with "(We need a map to confirm this)" which indicates it cannot
        determine the answer without additional information. This makes the actual
        answer UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, I can only
        give you a NO answer." However, this NO is not a comparative result about
        the locations. The model admits it doesn't have access to a map and "can't
        definitively answer your question." The NO appears to be a refusal to make
        the comparison due to lack of information rather than a comparative conclusion.

        stating "Virginia is to the south of Iowa" and therefore "Epworth is not north
        of Blue Ridge Shores." The model is claiming there's a directional difference
        (south/north relationship), not equality.

        being compared are equal or the same. It mentions needing to identify locations,
        use a map, and consider latitude and longitude, but never concludes that the
        locations have equal values on any measure. The model gives a NO answer without
        explaining that it's due to equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model provided a conclusion that "Chillicothe,
        OH is located north of Norfork, AR" but did not explicitly state a YES or

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; rather
        it indicated it couldn't make the determination without a map.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" but it immediately
        qualifies this with "(We need a map to confirm this)". This indicates the
        model cannot determine the answer without additional information (a map),
        making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO comparative result.

        are equal or the same. It simply states that Stirling, NJ is not located north
        of Salt Creek, CO without mentioning equality as the reason. The model does
        not provide any explanation about the values being equal or identical as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Stirling, NJ is not located

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; rather
        it indicated it couldn't make the determination without a map.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" but it immediately
        qualifies this with "(We need a map to confirm this)" which indicates it cannot
        determine the answer without additional information. This is effectively saying
        "NO, I cannot verify" which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, we cannot
        give a YES or NO answer." This indicates the model is refusing to provide
        a definitive comparative answer to the question. The model acknowledges it
        doesn't have access to a map and can only reason logically, which is insufficient
        to make the comparison.

        it indicated it couldn't make the determination without a map.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" but it immediately
        qualifies this with "(We need a map to confirm this)" which indicates it cannot

        stating "California is much further east than Michigan" (which is actually
        incorrect, but that's not relevant to our analysis). Since the model is claiming
        a difference in position rather than equality, this is not a case where the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't provide any specific reason
        for the NO answer related to equality of values. It simply states the answer
        is NO after mentioning that we need to understand the direction.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" at the end of its response, making a clear affirmative judgment about
        the comparison.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    bd93ca52-1eb8-41b7-bfb8-2294fb06a6c7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give you a definitive
        YES or NO answer because I cannot access a map or real-time information."
        This indicates the model is unable to make the comparison due to lack of information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
