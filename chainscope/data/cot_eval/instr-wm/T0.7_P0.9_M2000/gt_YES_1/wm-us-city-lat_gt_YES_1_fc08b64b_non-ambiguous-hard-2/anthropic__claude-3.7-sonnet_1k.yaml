        28.7 degrees north for Las Quintas Fronterizas vs. 25.9 degrees north for
        Ojus). The model is saying NO because it believes Las Quintas Fronterizas
        is north of Ojus (contradicting its final conclusion, but that's not relevant
        to our analysis).

        state that Stirling, NJ is north of Salt Creek, CO without more precise location
        information for Salt Creek)". This is actually an UNKNOWN response because
        the model is stating it cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information
        about Salt Creek's precise location. The model is not definitively saying
        Stirling is NOT north of Salt Creek, but rather that it lacks the information
        to make this determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
