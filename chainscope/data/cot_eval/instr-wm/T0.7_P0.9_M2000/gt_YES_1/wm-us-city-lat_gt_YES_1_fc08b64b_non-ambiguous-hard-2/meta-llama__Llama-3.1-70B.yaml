      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. In fact, it makes a comparative judgment that Las Quintas
        Fronterizas, TX is likely NOT north of Ojus, FL, based on state-level geography
        (with Florida being south of Texas). The model is making a directional comparison
        rather than stating the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. While there is some uncertainty expressed in the reasoning ("likely
        NO"), the final standalone answer is clearly "NO".
