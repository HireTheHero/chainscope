        In step 4, it explicitly states "Don Pedro Reservoir is located in a part
        of California that is north of Santa Barbara, where Our Lady of Sorrows Church
        is located." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question
        about whether Don Pedro Reservoir is south of Our Lady of Sorrows Church.
