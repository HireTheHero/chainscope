        "irrelevant" because they're in different states. The model is not claiming
        the locations are at the same latitude.

        states), and therefore UCCU Center is not located north of Black Canyon Lake.
        The NO is based on geographical reasoning, not on equality of values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that the
        locations are in different states, saying "Since the two locations are in
        different states, I can definitively say that the UCCU Center is not north/south
        relative to Black Canyon Lake." This is not claiming equality but rather that
        the comparison doesn't apply due to the locations being in different states.

        its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment.

        it is north." This is not a definitive comparative result, but rather an admission
