      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it spends most of the response discussing
        the ambiguity of the location of "Edison Theatre, NY" and how parts of New
        York are north of Lake Rescue while other parts are south. The model never
        concludes that the locations have equal latitude or are at the same position.
        The NO answer appears to be based on the inability to definitively say Lake
        Rescue is north of the ambiguous Edison Theatre location, not because they're
        at the same coordinates.
