      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and "CANNOT DETERMINE the answer with confidence" due to
        insufficient information about one person's dates. This indicates inability
        to make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and acknowledges it lacks sufficient information to make
        the determination. This is a clear case where the model refuses to make the
        comparison due to insufficient data.

    23dbfeb8-3d82-45fd-8b35-c2805f3aa4c1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False. The model never claimed the birth dates were
        equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to missing historical data. This falls under UNKNOWN
        since the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information about one person's birth date.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion, so the question of equal values is not relevant.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer" and concludes with "CANNOT DETERMINE" due to incomplete
        information about one person's birth date. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 390 CE comes before
        577 CE and uses this difference to conclude that Chu Liang was born earlier,
        not later.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the birth dates and determining that Chu Liang was born earlier,
        not later than Wu Shihuo.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in birth years (560 vs 577) and concludes NO because Chu Liang was born first,
        not because the dates were equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that "Chu Liang was not born later than
        Wu Shihuo"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the birth dates are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly notes a difference, with Wu Shihuo being born
        in late 6th century (570-590 CE) and Chu Liang likely born in late 7th century.
        The NO answer is based on this temporal difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Chu Liang was not
        born later than Wu Shihuo)" as its comparative conclusion. This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        same year (560 CE) and uses this equality as the primary reason for its NO
        answer, stating "Since they were born in the same year, Chu Liang was not
        born later than Wu Shihuo."

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they were likely born "around
        the same period," it also suggests Chu Liang was born "slightly earlier."
        This indicates the values are not exactly equal, and the NO answer is based
        on Chu Liang being earlier, not on them being the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        after determining that Chu Liang was NOT born later than Wu Shihuo. This is
        a clear comparative NO answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        birth dates are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference,
        with Chu Liang being born earlier, and this difference (not equality) is given
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO - Chu Liang
        was not born later than Wu Shihuo" as a direct comparative answer, making
        this a clear NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values (birth dates) are equal. The model explicitly states that Wu Shihuo
        lived later than Chu Liang, indicating a clear temporal difference between
        them. The NO is based on the opposite ordering, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that Chu Liang was not born later than Wu Shihuo. This is a direct NO answer
        to a comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they were born "around the
        same time period," it doesn't state they were born at exactly the same time.
        Instead, it suggests Sabinus was born "around the same time period as Huiyuan
        or slightly earlier." The NO answer is based on insufficient evidence to prove
        Huiyuan was born later, not on them being born at exactly the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, after analyzing the dates and determining it cannot confirm
        Huiyuan was born later than Sabinus.

    0c2854bc-c3d2-4eff-b5d8-26f88121bc6d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal - it actually found that Huiyuan was born earlier (334 CE) than Sabinus
        (340-350 CE) and gave NO based on this difference
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing

    166bdcc7-c711-4d0b-88bb-0aea50e8135f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they were born "around the
        same time," it actually indicates Huiyuan was born "earlier than or around
        the same time." This suggests a difference (even if slight) rather than exact
        equality, and the NO is based on Huiyuan being earlier, not on them being
        exactly equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (Huiyuan was
        not born later than Sabinus of Piacenza)" as a direct comparative answer
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1d829d36-8ef8-4d15-b0ec-01d11710c675:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer because it found a
        difference in birth dates (334 CE vs 350-360 CE), not because the values were
        equal. The model explicitly states Huiyuan was born before Sabinus.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the birth dates of Huiyuan and Sabinus, providing a direct
        comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    51431c42-d853-4187-a91a-e5e94ca3c874:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a NO comparison based on equal values - it instead stated it couldn't make
        the comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO DEFINITIVE ANSWER
        POSSIBLE" and explains that it cannot determine the comparison due to incomplete
        historical records. This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    65a7dc73-875e-4ad6-bfdd-0fd0bd31bb6a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the birth dates are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Huiyuan was born in 334 CE while Sabinus
        was likely born "several years later (around 340-350 CE)". The NO answer is
        based on this difference in dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO - Huiyuan
        was not born later than Sabinus of Piacenza." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

    7fd48173-1493-4728-b735-8b2a74485687:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes different birth dates (334 CE vs 330-340 CE)
        and uses this difference to reach its conclusion. Even though the dates are
        close, the model identifies a specific difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the birth dates of both figures.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    941e7f40-c44b-4349-96a1-dc4545fd2dee:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        did not claim the values were equal - it actually indicated they were born
        very close to each other but with uncertainty about who was born first.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        it "cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer" due to historical uncertainty.
        The NO is given as a forced choice with low confidence. When a model expresses
        inability to determine the comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they were born around the same
        time ("rough contemporaries"), it explicitly states that Sabinus was "likely
        born slightly earlier" and was born "around the same time or slightly before
        Huiyuan." Since it indicates a difference in timing (even if slight), this
        does not qualify as stating they were exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, and provides this as a clear final determination based on its analysis
        of the birth dates.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        not state they were born at the same time. Instead, it indicated Agnes was
        likely born in the "early-to-mid 13th century" while Ibn-Abi-Suhula was born
        in the "mid-to-late 13th century" - suggesting different (not equal) birth
        times. The NO answer was based on this temporal difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it clearly indicated a temporal difference
        between the two people, with Agnes d'Harcourt (died 1291) coming before Ibn-Abi-Suhula
        (active around 1320).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative result, indicating that Agnes d'Harcourt
        was not born later than Ibn-Abi-Suhula.

        (13th vs 14th century). The NO answer is based on this difference in timing,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        states there is a difference in birth years (1202 vs 1203, "one year earlier").
        The NO is not because the values are equal, but because Alfonso was born before
        Yao Shu.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final comparative answer, explaining that Alfonso was born one
        year earlier than Yao Shu. This is a direct NO answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and concludes with "INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION to answer YES
        or NO". This indicates the model cannot make the determination due to lack
        of data, specifically Gao Qu's birth date.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after laying out a logical comparison showing Gao Qu lived earlier than Abu
        Dawood.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2, regardless of any
        discussion of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to insufficient data about Gao Qu's birth date. This
        indicates it cannot make the comparison due to missing information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it concludes NO based on finding that Gao Qu was likely
        born before Abu Dawood (late 700s/early 800s vs 817 CE), indicating a difference
        in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, without any caveats
        about uncertainty or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Gao Qu lived about
        400 years BEFORE Abu Dawood" - indicating a clear difference in timing rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, explaining that Gao Qu was not born later than Abu Dawood.
        This is a direct NO answer to the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on finding different
        values (1408 vs 1552) and determining their order, not because the values
        were equal. The model explicitly states that one date comes before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the birth years and determining that Alain VII was born earlier,
        not later, than Rudolf II.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated there was a difference
        of about 290 years between the birth dates (1262 vs 1552), and the NO was
        because Alain was born earlier rather than later.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer after analyzing the birth dates and determining
        that Alain VII was born earlier, not later than Rudolf II.

        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, while the response
        mentions the births were "around the same time," this was not used as a reason
        for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: Although the response initially states "NO", it then
        contradicts itself by saying "The answer is YES" and provides a final clarification
        in brackets confirming YES as the intended answer, explaining that since 1477
        comes after 1476, Agnes Howard was born later.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found a clear difference
        of about 755 years between the birth dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly concludes that Hugbert was "likely born before Othmar",
        indicating a difference in birth dates. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.

    434ec3cb-cf30-464d-985b-8978fba58968:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly concludes that Hugbert was born earlier than
        Saint Othmar. The NO appears to be a direct response to the original comparison
        question (though we don't see the question), indicating a difference rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining its reasoning about the birth dates of Hugbert and Saint
        Othmar.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they were born "around the
        same time or slightly earlier," this is not presented as the reason for the
        NO answer. The model concludes NO because Hugbert was likely not born later
        than Othmar, indicating a temporal difference (even if slight). The model
        does not state they were born at exactly the same time, and equality is not
        given as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the timeline of both figures.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that "Hugbert was most likely born before
        Othmar" indicating a difference in birth dates (Hugbert around 680-690 CE
        vs Othmar around 689 CE).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the birth dates of both figures.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the birth dates are equal. Instead, it concludes that Hugbert was likely born
        BEFORE 689 (Othmar's birth year). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in timing, not on equality of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        as its final answer to the comparative question, both in its conclusion ("Therefore:

    905de996-ea6d-4047-afab-a350956a2859:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. While it mentions they might have been born "around the same
        time" as one possibility, it primarily concludes that Hugbert was "probably
        born before Othmar" and "definitely not later." This indicates a difference
        in timing rather than equality as the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to the comparative question, providing a clear negative response based
        on its analysis of the timeline.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the birth dates are
        equal/same/identical. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Hugbert
        was "almost certainly born before Othmar" - indicating a difference in timing,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Hugbert of
        Bavaria was not born later than Saint Othmar." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

        was likely born in the late 7th century (before 689)" while "Othmar was born
        in 689 CE"), indicating a difference in their birth dates.

        the birth dates are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Ishikawa Ishiashi
        was "born significantly earlier than Al-Walid I." The NO answer is given because
        the comparison goes in the opposite direction of what was asked, not because
        the dates are the same.

        difference (the "before" part) rather than stating they were exactly equal.
        The model does not explicitly state that the dates are the same/equal as the
        primary reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), we automatically
        classify this as False. Additionally, the model clearly showed different values
        (1963 vs 1975) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is confusing as it starts with
        "NO:" but then gives "YES" as its answer. Since the model explicitly states
        "YES" in its final comparative conclusion, and the reasoning supports this
        answer (showing Baumgartl was born later), we should classify this as a YES
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a clear
        difference in timing (approximately 3,000 years), not because the values are
        equal. The model explicitly states that Balgi lived earlier than Zhu Jun.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Balgi was not born
        later than Zhu Jun" and provides a clear comparative conclusion that Balgi
        lived approximately 3,000 years earlier.

        model never claimed the birth dates were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine one of them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT DETERMINE whether
        Balgi was born later than Zhu Jun due to insufficient information about Balgi."
        This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to missing information.

        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT DETERMINE YES
        OR NO" and explains it cannot verify key information needed to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        of about 300 years between them, with Berenice living BEFORE Wang Chong. The
        NO was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference
        of several centuries between them, with Berenice living before Wang Chong.
        The NO was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Berenice was not born later than Wang Chong. This
        is a direct NO answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Berenice lived earlier
        than Wang Chong (267 BCE vs 27 CE), indicating a clear difference in time
        periods. The NO was because the comparison went in the opposite direction
        of what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, after laying out a step-by-step reasoning
        that Berenice lived earlier, not later, than Wang Chong.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Berenice lived earlier (in BCE)
        while Wang Chong lived later (in CE). The NO is based on this temporal difference,
        not on equality of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Berenice was not
        born later than Wang Chong)" as its final comparative answer. This is a clear
        NO response to whether Berenice was born later.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give its NO answer because the
        values are equal. Instead, it suggests Wykes was likely born after Eleanor
        ("suggests he was likely born after Eleanor"), indicating a difference in
        timing. The uncertainty noted doesn't change that the model asserts a difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, followed by a caveat about uncertainty. Since it provides a clear
        NO answer (even with uncertainty noted), this should be classified as NO rather
        than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. While the model does
        suggest they were born "around the same period," this is irrelevant since
        the final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot make the comparison due to uncertainty
        around one of the birth dates. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        as the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the birth dates are
        equal/same/identical. Instead, it concludes NO because Eleanor was born in
        1223 while Thomas was likely born after that (in 1220s or 1230s), indicating
        a difference in timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Eleanor of Provence
        was not born later than Thomas Wykes)" as its final comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never gave a NO answer, instead stating it couldn't make a determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "Cannot provide a definitive
        YES/NO answer" due to uncertainty in the birth dates. This is a clear case
        where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        data.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2, regardless of any
        discussion of equal or similar dates in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot make a definitive
        YES or NO determination" and concludes with "Cannot determine with certainty."
        This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient historical
        records.

        in the 1230s, concluding that "Eleanor was born earlier than Thomas Wykes".
        The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Eleanor of Provence
        was not born later than Thomas Wykes" as its final comparative conclusion,

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because it found Eleanor was born
        BEFORE Thomas Wykes (around 1223 vs 1240-1250), not because the dates were
        equal. It explicitly states a difference in timing.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        birth dates are equal. The model explicitly states Eleanor was born EARLIER
        (1223) than Thomas Wykes (1235-1240), and this difference in dates is the
        reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, and this NO is given as a direct comparative answer
        (Eleanor was not born later than Thomas)

        stating that "Zhuge Hui died in 264 CE" while Joseph was active around "320-330
        CE" and "born in the late 3rd century CE". The NO answer is because the comparison
        doesn't hold in the direction asked, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative conclusion that "Joseph of Tiberias was not born later than Zhuge
        Hui"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the birth dates are
        equal/same/identical. Instead, it concludes that Agis III was born around
        351 BC or earlier, while Alexander was born in 356 BC - indicating a difference
        in birth dates, with Agis III being born before Alexander. The NO answer is
        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Agis III was not born
        later than Alexander the Great" as its final conclusion after the step-by-step
        analysis. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Agis
        III was born BEFORE Alexander (before 350 BC vs 356 BC), not because they
        were born at the same time. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in birth dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after walking through its reasoning steps comparing the birth dates of Alexander
        the Great and Agis III.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the dates were equal
        - it explicitly stated Song Yu was born earlier (around 290 BCE) compared
        to Ziying (who lived until 207 BCE). The NO was based on this difference in
        dates, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the birth dates are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly states that Song Yu was born around 290 BCE
        while Ziying's life ended around 207 BCE, indicating different times. The
        NO answer is given because Song Yu was born earlier, not because the dates
        were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Song Yu was not born
        later than Ziying)" as its final comparative answer. This is a clear NO response
        to indicate Song Yu was born earlier, not later, than Ziying.

        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Song Yu lived and died before Ziying,
        indicating a clear temporal difference between them. The NO appears to be
        answering whether Song Yu was born later than Ziying (rather than earlier).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        in fact, it explicitly states that Song Yu was born earlier (~290 BCE) than
        Ziying (after 230 BCE). The NO answer appears to be given because Song Yu
        was born EARLIER, not because they were born at the same time.
