        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that Jakob Ernst died in 1747 while
        Francesco III died in 1766, and concludes that 1747 is earlier than 1766.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (death dates)

        Sigebert III died in 656 AD, and concludes that 618 AD is earlier than 656
        AD. The NO answer is based on a difference in values, not equality.

        than NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same,
        but rather because it couldn't determine Yu Cong's death date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (due to insufficient
        information)" which indicates it cannot determine the comparison due to lack
        of information about Yu Cong's death date. This is a case where the model
        is stating it cannot make the determination, which falls under the UNKNOWN
        category according to the criteria.

        a difference in timing (late 1400s/early 1500s vs. early 1500s/around 1510),
        not equality. The NO answer is based on this difference in timing, not on
        the values being equal.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is YES" in
        its conclusion, clearly indicating that Guillaume de Harsigny died at a later
        date than Roger I Trencavel.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is **YES**,
        Guillaume de Harsigny died at a later date than Roger I Trencavel." The model
        provides a clear YES answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not claim
        the values were equal - in fact, it explicitly stated that 1393 is later than
        1150.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is YES" and
        confirms "Guillaume de Harsigny died at a later date than Roger I Trencavel."
        This is a clear affirmative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'

        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is **YES**"
        in its conclusion after comparing the death dates of Guillaume de Harsigny
        (1398) and Roger I Trencavel (1150).

        is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: YES" at
        the end of its response, making it clear that its answer is YES.'
