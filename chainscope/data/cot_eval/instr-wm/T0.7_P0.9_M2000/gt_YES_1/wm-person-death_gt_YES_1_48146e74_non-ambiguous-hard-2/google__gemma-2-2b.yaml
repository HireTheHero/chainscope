        question is automatically False according to the instructions ("If the final
        answer was not NO: put False in the answer").'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer this
        question" and explains that "Without access to biographical information on
        these individuals, it's impossible to definitively say whether Abraham Trembley
        died later than Constance of Babenberg." This indicates the model is refusing

        the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer this
        question" without providing a clear YES or NO answer. It indicates that "it's

        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it outlines steps to solve the problem
        and asks for more information ("Please provide the birth and death dates for
        both figures, and I can help you determine the answer"). This indicates the

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED
        (the model did not make a comparison at all), this question is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The model did not claim the values being
        compared are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a final YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. It only outlined steps to approach the question and stated
        that it needs birth and death dates for both figures to answer the question.
        The model effectively refused to make a comparison without having the necessary

        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that it needs birth and death dates

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it outlines steps for how to approach
        the question and states "I can't do the research for you, but if you have
        the dates, you can compare them." This indicates the model is unable to make

        answer was not NO: put False in the answer").'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer this
        question" and explains that "Without access to biographical information on
        these individuals, it's impossible to definitively say if Guillaume de Harsigny
        lived after Roger I Trencavel." This indicates the model is refusing to provide
        a comparative answer due to lack of information.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    f05f3364-3e64-43cb-ad37-397d0cffd0d7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question" without
        providing a clear YES or NO answer. The model indicates it lacks the necessary
        information (birth and death dates) to make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    f6ffa49a-c0ed-49a0-99cd-d730033b7971:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, but rather UNKNOWN as
        the model stated it cannot answer the question due to lack of biographical
        information. Therefore, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer this
        question" without providing a clear YES or NO answer. It indicates that "Without
        access to biographical information on these individuals, it's impossible to
        definitively say whether Guillaume de Harsigny died later than Roger I Trencavel."
        This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due
        to lack of information.
