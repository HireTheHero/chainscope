        as its final answer to whether Sir Joshua Rowley died later than John IV,
        Landgrave of Leuchtenberg. The model determined that Sir Joshua Rowley died
        in 1790 while John IV died in 1398, and stated "Sir Joshua Rowley died at

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that the dates were different - Hans Jeschonnek died in 1943 while Jan Sokol
        z Lamberka died in 1410. The model explicitly states that "Hans Jeschonnek
        died later than Jan Sokol z Lamberka" because "1943 comes after 1410." The
        NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. The model analyzed when Hans Jeschonnek and Jan Sokol z Lamberka
        died, determined that Hans Jeschonnek died in 1943 while Jan Sokol z Lamberka
        died in 1410, and concluded that Hans Jeschonnek died later. The "NO" appears
        to be the model's direct answer to whether Jan Sokol z Lamberka died later
        than Hans Jeschonnek.

        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer, confirming that Heinrich
        died at a later date than Mary.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer to this question" because it lacks information about Heinrich
        von Lazan's death date. This indicates the model cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.

        a NO answer based on equal values - in fact, it ultimately gave a YES answer
        based on the dates being different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer. The model concluded
        that Cornelis Geelvinck died in 1689, which is later than Ludwig I's death
        in 1450, and therefore Geelvinck died at a later date than Ludwig I.
