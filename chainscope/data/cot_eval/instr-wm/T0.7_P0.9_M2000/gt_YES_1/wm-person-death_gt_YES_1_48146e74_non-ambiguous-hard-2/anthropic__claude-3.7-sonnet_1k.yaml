      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response, confirming that Abraham Trembley died at a later date than Constance
        of Babenberg. The model provides dates (1784 for Trembley and 1243 for Constance)
        and clearly concludes with "YES" as its final answer.

        are equal. Instead, it clearly states that Elia Levita died in 1549 and Elisabeth
        of Bohemia died in 1680, and concludes that "Elia Levita died earlier than
        Elisabeth of Bohemia, not later." The NO answer is based on a difference in
        values (1549 vs 1680), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Elia Levita did not die later than Elisabeth of
        Bohemia. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
