      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (death dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Yu Cong died
        in the mid-3rd century AD" while "Sigebert III died in 656 AD (mid-7th century
        AD)" and concludes that "Yu Cong died before Sigebert III, not later." The
        NO answer is based on a clear difference in timing (3rd century vs 7th century),
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Yu Cong did not die later than Sigebert III. The
        model provides a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that Yu Cong died around 604 AD while
        Sigebert III died in 656 AD, and concludes that 604 AD is earlier than 656
        AD. The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model explicitly concludes "NO, 604 AD is
        earlier than 656 AD" when asked if Yu Cong died later than Sigebert III.

        (death dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that Yu Cong died between
        601-604 AD while Sigebert III died around 656 AD, and concludes that Yu Cong
        died before Sigebert III. The NO answer is based on this temporal difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Yu Cong died later than Sigebert III. The model
        clearly concludes that Yu Cong died before Sigebert III, not later.

        Sigebert III died around 656 AD, and concludes that "Yu Cong died earlier
        than Sigebert III." The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
