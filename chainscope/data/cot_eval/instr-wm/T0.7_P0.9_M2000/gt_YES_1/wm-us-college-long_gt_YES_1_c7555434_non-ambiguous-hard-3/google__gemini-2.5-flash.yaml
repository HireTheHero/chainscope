    224f6c82-ce7d-4052-8922-607f4b4a2bbe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives NO because it believes "George Wythe
        University, UT does not exist" and therefore "cannot be located anywhere."
        The reason for the NO answer is the alleged non-existence of one entity, not
        that the locations have equal longitude or are in the same place.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice at the end
        of its response. While it acknowledges that Utah is geographically east of
        California, it concludes with "NO" because it believes George Wythe University
        doesn't exist. Since the model gives a clear "NO" answer based on the non-existence
        of one entity rather than indicating it cannot make the comparison, this is
        classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    2dbdeb73-f017-479f-b4a3-6d135757f67f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. However, the model also explains that "George Wythe University,
        UT" appears to be fictional or non-existent, and therefore the comparison
        cannot be made. Since the model is rejecting the premise of the question (one
        of the entities doesn't exist), this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. However, the model also explains that "George Wythe University,
        UT" doesn't exist, and therefore the comparison is impossible. The model is
        rejecting the premise of the question by stating one of the entities doesn't
        exist, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The final answer is YES"
        in a boxed format at the end of its response, after analyzing the locations
        and determining that George Wythe University is east of Bay Area Medical Academy.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    fd66e22e-0877-496f-bde2-7cc442861195:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that if George Wythe University
        were real and in Utah, it would be east of Bay Area Medical Academy in California.
        The NO answer is based on this directional relationship (east vs. west), not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. While it does note that one of the institutions doesn't
        exist, it still provides a definitive "NO" as its comparative answer after
        considering a hypothetical scenario where the institution would exist in Utah.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
