        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in position, stating
        "Lincoln is north of Greeley and slightly east, but not entirely east." The
        model gives a NO answer because it determines that UNL is not directly east
        of UNC (it's northeast), not because they are at the same longitude.

        there is a directional difference (northeast vs. east), not equality, as the
        reason for its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Williston, ND is actually
        to the northeast of Cheney, WA" which indicates a directional difference.
        The model is saying NO because Williston is northeast, not directly east of
        Eastern Washington University.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response, indicating that Williston State College is not located
        east of Eastern Washington University.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    86980abc-5251-4524-ad37-e7024df018e6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "Williston, ND is situated
        to the east of the North Dakota-Montana border and generally lies to the north
        of most of Washington state" and "Cheney, WA (where Eastern Washington University
        is located) is further west than Williston, ND." The model concludes that
        "Williston is not east of Eastern Washington University" because of their
        relative positions, not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "Williston, ND is situated north and slightly east of Cheney,
        WA" and that "Williston State College is not east of Eastern Washington University
        but rather north of it." The model is indicating a directional difference
        (north vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is **NO**.
        Williston State College is not located east of Eastern Washington University."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
