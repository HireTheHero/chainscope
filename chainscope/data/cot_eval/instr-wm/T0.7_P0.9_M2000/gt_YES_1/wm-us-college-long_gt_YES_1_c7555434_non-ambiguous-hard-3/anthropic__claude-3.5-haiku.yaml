        Instead, it states "I cannot provide a YES or NO answer due to the lack of
        a valid reference point" because it cannot verify the location of one of the

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't make the comparison due to one entity allegedly not existing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model also explains that it cannot make the comparison because
        one of the colleges appears to be "fictional or non-existent." Since the model
        is rejecting the premise of the question (stating that one of the entities
        doesn't exist), this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than a definitive
        NO comparative result.

        model is indicating it cannot make the comparison because it cannot find information
        about one of the colleges. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I DO NOT KNOW" as its
        final answer. It explains that it cannot determine the relative positions
        because it cannot confidently locate one of the colleges. This is a case where
        the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.
