        on the model's assessment that the locations have different positions, not
        that they are equal.

        says "NO - this statement is incorrect" but then says "The correct answer

        followed by an explanation that contradicts this answer, I'll classify this

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question doesn't apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself, stating "Wait, I made a mistake in my answer" and explicitly concluded
        with "YES" as its final answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, Oakwood University,
        AL is located east of University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma, OK." at
        the end of its response.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
