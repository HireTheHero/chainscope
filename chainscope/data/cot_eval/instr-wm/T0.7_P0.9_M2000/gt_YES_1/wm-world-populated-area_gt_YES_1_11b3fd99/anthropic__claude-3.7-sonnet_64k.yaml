        Instead, it explicitly states that Morgan's Point (1.6 square miles) is larger
        than Sisquoc (0.2 square miles). The model says "1.6 square miles is larger
        than 0.2 square miles" and concludes that Sisquoc does NOT have a larger area

        1.6 square miles while Sisquoc doesn't have defined boundaries. The model
        concludes that Sisquoc is likely smaller, not that they are equal. The reason
        for the NO is that Sisquoc is described as a small unincorporated community
        without evidence that it encompasses a larger area than Morgan's Point.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Sisquoc, California
        does not have a larger area than Morgan's Point, Texas" as its final conclusion.
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        square kilometers while Paros regional unit has 196-230 square kilometers.
        The model's NO answer is based on Comilla having a smaller area than Paros,
        not because they have equal areas.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after comparing the areas of Comilla Sadar Dakshin Upazila (185.8 square kilometers)
        and Paros regional unit (196-230 square kilometers). The model explicitly

        Sadar Dakshin Upazila (185.8 square kilometers) has a smaller area than Paros
        regional unit (196 square kilometers). The model explicitly states "Since
        185.8 square kilometers is less than 196 square kilometers, Comilla Sadar
        Dakshin Upazila has a smaller area than Paros regional unit." The values are
        not equal, and the model clearly identifies a difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after comparing the areas of Comilla Sadar Dakshin Upazila and Paros regional

        Instead, it explicitly states that one area (185.62 sq km) is less than the
        other area (231+ sq km), and this inequality is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the areas of Comilla Sadar Dakshin Upazila and Paros regional
        unit. The model concludes with "Since 185.62 is less than 231, Comilla Sadar

        Upazila has an area of 185.92 sq km while Paros regional unit has an area
        of 231 sq km. The model concludes "Since 185.92 sq km is less than 231 sq
        km, Comilla Sadar Dakshin Upazila does not have a larger area than Paros regional
        unit." This shows the values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model directly answers the comparative
        question about whether Comilla Sadar Dakshin Upazila has a larger area than
        Paros (regional unit) with a definitive "NO" after comparing their areas.

        Instead, it explicitly states that Singkawang (504 sq km) has a smaller area
        than Balikpapan (843 sq km). The model gives the reason for its NO answer
        as "Since 504 sq km is less than 843 sq km, Singkawang has a smaller area
        than Balikpapan."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Does Singkawang have larger area than Balikpapan?" The model
        explicitly concludes with "NO" after comparing the areas of both cities.

        Instead, it explicitly states that "504 square kilometers (Singkawang) is
        smaller than 843 square kilometers (Balikpapan)" and concludes that Singkawang
        does NOT have a larger area than Balikpapan. The NO answer is based on Singkawang
        being smaller, not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Singkawang does NOT have a larger area than Balikpapan. This
        is a direct and explicit answer to the comparative question.

        contradiction with the model's own reasoning, as it first establishes that
        Patratu is larger and then says "NO" to whether Patratu has a larger area.
        The values are clearly not equal in the model's assessment.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO, Patratu does not
        have a larger area than Versailles, Pennsylvania - it has a MUCH larger area."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question, even though the model

        in the conclusion section. The model clearly compares the areas of Qit'at
        Jaradah and Zhongsha Islands and determines that Zhongsha Islands are larger,

        stating that Qit'at Jaradah is approximately 113 square meters while Zhongsha
        Islands encompass around 9,100 square kilometers (9,100,000,000 square meters).
        The model concludes that "The Zhongsha Islands encompass an area many millions
        of times larger than Qit'at Jaradah." This is clearly indicating a difference
        in values, not equality.

        Jaradah is "extremely small, possibly only a few hundred square meters in
        area." The model concludes that "Zhongsha is much larger than the tiny Qit'at
        Jaradah island." The NO answer is based on a difference in size (Zhongsha
        being larger), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Qit'at Jaradah does
        not have a larger area than Zhongsha Islands" as its final answer. This is

        compared to Qit'at Jaradah's tiny area." The model gives a NO answer because
        one area is significantly larger than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        Instead, it clearly states that Hernando County (478 square miles) is smaller
        than Baker County (585 square miles). The model explicitly notes "Since 478
        is less than 585, Hernando County is smaller than Baker County." This indicates
        a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Hernando County, Florida does not have a larger
        area than Baker County, Florida. The model provides a clear comparative answer
        after analyzing the areas of both counties.

        Instead, it explicitly notes that Hernando County has 478 square miles while
        Baker County has 589 square miles, and concludes that "Hernando County has
        a smaller area than Baker County." The NO answer is based on this difference
        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Hernando County,
        Florida does not have a larger area than Baker County, Florida" as its final

        miles), not because the values are the same. The model explicitly states "Hernando
        County has a smaller area than Baker County" and shows that 478.8 is less
        than 585.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the areas of Hernando County (478.8 square miles)
        and Baker County (585 square miles). The model clearly concludes that Hernando
        County does not have a larger area than Baker County.

        Avarua district is approximately 13.44 square kilometers, and Avarua town
        is even smaller. The model is comparing different values and concluding that
        one is smaller than the other, not that they are the same.

        in area than Limache (281.5 sq km vs 118.9 sq km)." The model gives a clear
        reason for its NO answer - that Savannah has a larger area than Limache, not
        that they have equal areas.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The response ends with "# Answer: NO" which is an explicit negative answer
        to the comparative question about whether Limache has a larger area than Savannah,
        Georgia.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Savannah (281.5 square kilometers)
        is significantly larger than Limache (116.7 square kilometers), noting that
        Savannah is "more than twice the area" of Limache. The model gives a clear
        difference in values as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Does Limache have larger area than Savannah, Georgia?" The
        model provides a direct comparative result, concluding that Savannah is significantly
        larger than Limache.
