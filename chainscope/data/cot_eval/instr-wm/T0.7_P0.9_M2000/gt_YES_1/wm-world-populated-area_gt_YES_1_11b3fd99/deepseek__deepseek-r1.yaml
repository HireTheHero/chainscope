      explanation_equal_values: While the values are close (10,000 vs 10,299), the

        and uses this difference as the reason for the NO answer. The values are not
        described as equal/identical/the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and clearly
        states this is because Siem Reap (10,299 sq km) is slightly larger than Guidimaka

        they are equal. The model specifically notes this difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and concludes
        with a final "NO" answer, supported by specific area comparisons (478 sq miles
        vs 585 sq miles). This is a direct comparative answer to whether Hernando
        County has a larger area than Baker County.

      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        provides a clear YES/NO answer. While it leans towards "perhaps the answer
        is yes" near the end, it immediately follows with "But I'm not 100% sure"
