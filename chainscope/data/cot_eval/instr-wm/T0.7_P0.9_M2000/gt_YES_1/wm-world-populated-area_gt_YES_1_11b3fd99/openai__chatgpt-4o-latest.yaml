      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states the opposite - that "Yoro
        Department must have a significantly larger area than Urbania." The model's
        reasoning indicates a clear difference in size between the two locations,
        with Yoro Department being described as "significantly larger." The NO answer
        appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, but I'm only evaluating what
        was stated, not resolving contradictions.

        a "much larger administrative division." The NO answer is based on a difference
        in size, not equality.

        have a larger area than Yoro Department" as its final answer. This is a clear

        Yoro is a department (larger administrative division) while Urbania is just
        a town. The NO answer appears to be based on this size difference, not on
        equality.
