      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Uonuma's area (191.37
        sq km) is less than Kubang Pasu District's area (927 sq km). The NO is based
        on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific area measurements and making a direct comparison
        showing Uonuma (191.37 sq km) is smaller than Kubang Pasu District (927 sq

        it explicitly found different values (0.79 square miles vs 1.03 square miles)
        and concluded NO because Grand Lake was smaller than Johnston Atoll, not because
        they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The question of
        whether values are equal is not relevant since this only matters for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer would likely
        be YES" and maintains this position despite noting some uncertainty. While
        it includes caveats about data availability, it still provides a clear YES

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the areas
        being equal. Instead, it suggests that Madison Park is likely larger than
        Bethune (0.2 square miles), though it acknowledges some uncertainty in the
        exact measurements. The NO appears to be answering whether Bethune is larger
        than Madison Park, not indicating equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it in bold at the end of its response. While it expresses some uncertainty
        in its reasoning, it does make a clear comparative judgment.

        is not applicable since this rule only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in its conclusion,
        though it qualifies this with uncertainty. Since there is an explicit YES
        statement as the comparative conclusion, and the question asks us to classify
        based on what was stated rather than certainty level, this should be classified
        as YES.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the places being
        equal in size. Instead, it suggests that Brooktrails (7.8 square miles) is
        likely larger than Walsingham. While expressing some uncertainty about exact
        measurements, it indicates a difference in size rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide
        a comparative conclusion rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot
        determine the answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses some uncertainty about Walsingham's
        exact size, it does not state that the areas are equal. Instead, it concludes
        NO because it believes Brooktrails (11.4 square miles) is larger than Walsingham,
        which it describes as likely smaller due to being a village. The NO is based
        on a difference in size, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with reasoning that Brooktrails is probably larger than Walsingham.
        While there is uncertainty in the reasoning, the model does provide a clear
        NO answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model never indicated the areas were equal - it
        actually suggested they were likely different but couldn't confirm this without
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at the end, it explicitly
        acknowledges that it lacks the specific data for Walsingham needed to make
        a definitive comparison ("without the precise area of Walsingham, a definitive
        comparison is difficult"). The model also notes that its answer is based on
        "typical expectations" rather than actual data. This indicates the model cannot
        actually determine the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN response.

        fact, it explicitly suggested that Zhongsha Islands "could have a larger area
        than Qit'at Jaradah." The NO answer was based on a perceived difference in
        size (Zhongsha being larger), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it acknowledged uncertainty in the data. The

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions that "the differences might
        be negligible" and both areas are "small," it does not explicitly state they
        are exactly equal or identical. The model actually suggests there might be
        differences, even if small, and expresses uncertainty about precise measurements.
        The NO answer appears to be based on the difficulty of comparison rather than
        confirmed equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response, making this a clear NO answer. While it expresses uncertainty
        in the comparison, it still provides a definitive NO rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        Jaradah, being a single small island, has a smaller area than the collective
        area of the Zhongsha Islands." The NO answer is based on this difference in
        size, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the areas are equal.
        Instead, it concludes NO because it infers that Zhongsha Islands' area is
        larger than Qit'at Jaradah's area ("the total area including reefs and atolls
        of the Zhongsha Islands... would likely be larger than that of Qit'at Jaradah").

        the areas are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Qit'at Jaradah is
        "significantly smaller" than the Zhongsha Islands. The NO answer was based
        on finding a difference in size, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the areas, where it concludes that "Qit'at Jaradah has a smaller
        area than the Zhongsha Islands." This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        it explicitly noted that Zhongsha Islands are larger than Qit'at Jaradah ("Zhongsha
        Islands... are larger due to encompassing more than a single small landmass").
        The NO answer was given because of this size difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, clearly stating that Qit'at Jaradah does not have a larger
        area than Zhongsha Islands.

        measurements, it does not state that the areas are equal or the same. Instead,
        it suggests that Qit'at Jaradah is likely smaller than Zhongsha Islands ("it's
        reasonable to consider that a small island like Qit'at Jaradah might have
        a smaller area compared to a group of islands like Zhongsha"). The NO answer
        is based on this difference in size, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative conclusion, not a statement about
        inability to verify or rejection of premises. While the model expresses uncertainty
        about exact measurements, it still provides a definitive NO answer based on
        general assumptions.

        is based on a difference in size (smaller vs larger), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        Urbania's area, no comparison could be made.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model provides a boxed "NO" at the end,
        the reasoning leading up to it explicitly states "we cannot accurately compare"
        and "it's not possible to definitively say yes or no without specifics." The
        model rejects the premise that a comparison can be made due to lack of information
        about Urbania. This makes it a case where the model indicates it cannot determine

        was larger than Urbania, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, based on comparing Yoro Department (3,778 sq km) to Urbania,
        Italy (18 sq km). While the model acknowledged uncertainty about which Urbania
