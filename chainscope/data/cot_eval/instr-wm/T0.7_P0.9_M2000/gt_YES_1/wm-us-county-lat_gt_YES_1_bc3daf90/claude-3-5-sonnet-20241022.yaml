      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the counties are at equal
        positions - it explicitly states Yamhill County is "west and slightly south
        of Clackamas County" and uses this directional difference as the reason for
        its NO answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same location - instead, it explicitly states that Yamhill County is south
        of Clackamas County, indicating a clear directional difference between their
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Yamhill
        County is not located north of Clackamas County" as its comparative conclusion.

    59c027ec-fff6-4468-a4fc-23555b7dadcc:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "the bulk of Yamhill County
        sits at roughly the same latitude as Clackamas County" and uses this as the
        basis for its NO answer. This indicates the values (latitudes) are approximately
        equal, and this equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    63c9e31e-4eed-49f5-8724-8aa8bd2c0d46:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        equal latitude. Instead, it explicitly states that Yamhill County is "slightly
        south and west" of Clackamas County. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion about the relative
        positions of the counties.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same location or equal in any way. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Yamhill County is "south and west of Clackamas County" and provides this directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the counties, providing

    74b0732f-fb41-4dd3-86ff-0fb2b1aaeea1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same position - in fact, it explicitly states that "Yamhill County is
        actually slightly south of Clackamas County", indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer appears to be based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the counties, providing a direct
        comparative conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states "Yamhill County is slightly more to the south
        compared to Clackamas County", indicating a difference in position, even if
        small
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore: NO"

    865102ad-2364-497a-ac3b-3006a9ebcd3a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same latitude/position. Instead, it explicitly states that Yamhill County
        is "west and slightly south of Clackamas County", indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Yamhill County is
        not north of Clackamas County)" as its final answer, providing a clear comparative
        result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    89ffd7f8-ff4b-495b-86aa-d51410ff5fa3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        it actually notes differences, saying Clackamas extends further north than
        Yamhill, and describes their relative positions as different (west vs southeast
        of Portland)
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore: NO"
        as its final comparative answer'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states differences in position,
        noting that "Yamhill County is actually slightly south and west of Clackamas
        County" and "Clackamas County extends further north than Yamhill County".
        The NO answer is based on these differences, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the counties, indicating
        Yamhill County is not north of Clackamas County.

    1c00dd6f-edb6-4cf0-a1bf-c1e22162f011:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (one being south of the other), not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states Tennessee is "entirely south of Missouri"
        and concludes Grainger County "must be south of" Dunklin County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Grainger County, TN
        is not located north of Dunklin County, MO" as its final comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    32c3c8a6-fb61-41a0-a367-7f59997aaab6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or equal in any way. Instead, it concludes NO based on its
        reasoning that Grainger County must be south of Dunklin County, indicating
        a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after working through the geographical reasoning steps. This is a direct comparative
        answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    87eebe2d-8294-4de2-b15e-46606b1d905e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values question only applies when
        analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Grainger
        County, TN is located north of Dunklin County, MO" after its step-by-step
        analysis.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    953dde9f-65f2-4466-bb33-c77bba07cc22:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is\
        \ automatically False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found\
        \ different values (36.3\xB0N vs 36.0\xB0N), not equal ones."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore: YES"
        as its final answer after comparing the latitudes'
      final_answer: 'YES'

    9daa5dab-ca4c-41e6-b153-ef0c9690d37b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values criteria only apply when
        evaluating NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Grainger
        County, TN is located north of Dunklin County, MO." This is a clear affirmative
        answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    a5c7cd89-cf14-4851-a111-9e7bb808ddbb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically\
        \ results in False according to the criteria. The presence of different values\
        \ (36.3\xB0N vs 36.0\xB0N) is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality when\
        \ the final answer is NO."
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially said NO but then explicitly corrected
        itself and gave a final answer of YES, which is the definitive conclusion
        of the response.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    c44f7df2-65d5-4501-8aff-346af3cd5305:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude. Instead, it explains that while both locations have factors
        affecting their relative positions (northern TN vs southern MO), Tennessee
        is still south of Missouri's bootheel. The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Grainger
        County, TN is not located north of Dunklin County, MO." This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e24357aa-1622-4e6c-8bbf-be01223174e6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the locations are at\
        \ equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference, concluding\
        \ that Grainger County (36.3\xB0N) is south of Dunklin County. The NO answer\
        \ is based on this difference in latitude, not on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the comparative reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    eeb8b211-5c3b-4f5a-b898-111f04df22b3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly concludes that Grainger County must be
        south of Dunklin County. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step reasoning about the relative positions
        of the counties.

    0ae9d109-5b0f-49be-90b7-a05f271edced:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Imperial County
        is to the east of San Diego County, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    23df41e6-0646-4d27-b931-11af7556bc3f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they are "at roughly the
        same latitude," this is not given as the reason for the NO answer. Instead,
        the NO is because Imperial County is explicitly stated to be east of San Diego
        County, not north of it. The presence of a directional difference (east) means
        this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify the
        comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    39b52279-4764-4e13-b523-91a853eb9a44:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because Imperial
        County is east of San Diego County, not because the locations are equal/same/identical.
        It explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Imperial County is
        directly east").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they are "roughly at the
        same latitude," it explicitly states Imperial County is "slightly to the southeast
        of San Diego County." This indicates a difference in position, even if slight,
        rather than exact equality being the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they are "roughly at the
        same latitude," this is not given as the primary reason for the NO answer.
        Instead, the model explicitly states that Imperial County is to the east of
        San Diego County, indicating a directional difference as the main reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Imperial
        County is not located north of San Diego County" as its final conclusion.

    79e3cd3b-dcaf-4871-8b96-ca784d63103f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same latitude or equally north. Instead, it explicitly states that Imperial
        County is "directly EAST of San Diego County" - indicating a different relative
        position, not equality. The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO - Imperial
        County is not located north of San Diego County" as its final comparative
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Imperial County
        being east of San Diego County, not because the counties are at the same location.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("located EAST
        of San Diego County, not north"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the geographical positions of the counties. This
        is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

    93832ef6-549b-433c-b2d5-4fde3be1bfb6:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model indicates that the counties are "at roughly
        the same latitude" and "neither is clearly north of the other," suggesting
        their equal positioning is the primary reason for the NO answer. The model
        doesn't note any north-south difference between them.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        it actually specifies that Imperial County is "slightly more southern than
        San Diego County". This difference in position, even though described as slight,
        means the NO answer was not due to equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states they
        are in different positions ("it's the other way around"), indicating Dubois
        County is north of Fleming County. The NO is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly explains
        that Fleming County is not north of Dubois County (stating it's "the other
        way around"). This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    4c5b2b3d-d9bd-46c5-8e31-be3f84ead7a0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the relative positions
        being different (Fleming County being south of Dubois County), not because
        the locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly describes different
        positions for the two counties.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning about the relative positions of the counties, making a definitive
        comparative judgment.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Fleming County must be south
        of Dubois County, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating Fleming County is not north of
        Dubois County.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states they are different, with Dubois County
        being north of Fleming County. The NO is because the relationship is the opposite
        of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Fleming
        County, KY is not located north of Dubois County, IN" as its final comparative
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model concluded NO because
        it determined Fleming County was south of Dubois County, indicating a difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        and explicitly concludes "Fleming County, KY is NOT north of Dubois County,
        IN" as a comparative result.

        being different (Fleming County being south of Dubois County), not because
        they are at the same location. The model explicitly describes different positions
        for the counties.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning about the relative positions of the counties, providing a
        direct comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Fleming County must be south
        of Dubois County, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Fleming County, KY
        is not located north of Dubois County, IN)" as its final answer. This is a
        clear NO comparative result.

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        positions (one north of the other). The NO answer appears to be based on finding
        a specific directional difference between the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in position (Swisher
        County is on the west side of Briscoe County), even though they are at the
        same latitude level. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative
        conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they are "at approximately the
        same latitude," this is not given as the reason for the NO answer. Instead,
        the NO answer is because Swisher County is to the west of Briscoe County,
        with an east-west orientation rather than a north-south one. The model identifies
        a clear directional difference (west vs east) rather than equality as the
        reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result about the relative positions of the
        counties, stating that Swisher County is NOT located north of Briscoe County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal/same/identical. Instead, it describes a specific directional relationship
        (Briscoe County is directly SOUTH of Swisher County) as the basis for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" as its final comparative answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it gives a clear directional difference as its reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "Swisher County is directly west of Briscoe
        County" (not equal positions). While it notes they are at "approximately the
        same latitude," this is not given as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

    8ca0794a-bd49-4557-bca2-f09dab18fbce:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the counties are at the
        same latitude or equally north. Instead, it explained they are "side by side"
        and that "neither county is north of the other" because they are "east-west
        neighbors". This explains why the answer is NO, but not because of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore: NO"
        as its final comparative answer, making this a clear NO response.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same latitude or equally north. Instead, it explains that they are side-by-side
        with an east-west orientation, with Swisher being west of Briscoe. The NO
        answer is based on their relative positions being east-west rather than north-south,
        not because they are at equal latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer that Swisher County is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Swisher County is south of Briscoe County), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the counties.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion after determining that Swisher County is south

        results in False for question 2, regardless of any equality comparisons in
        the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a NO answer but then explicitly

        the basis for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model didn't make a comparison
        based on equal values - it stated the comparison was impossible due to one
        location not existing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating that Golden
        Valley County, ND doesn't exist, making the comparison impossible. While it
        says "NO", it immediately qualifies this by explaining that the question cannot
        be answered, making this effectively a rejection of the premise.

        County". Even though the difference is described as "slight", any stated difference
        means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        reason given for the NO answer ("Since they are at approximately the same
        latitude, neither is truly north of the other"). This matches the criteria

        "slightly north of Kalkaska County" and notes differences in their east-west
        positions. While it mentions they are "at about the same latitude," it ultimately
        identifies a difference in position, making this not a case of equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,

        the model contradicts itself earlier in the response, we must take the final
        stated difference at face value.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the counties are "roughly at
        the same latitude," it explicitly states there is a difference with "Kalkaska
        County is slightly SOUTH of Oscoda County." Since any difference, even if
        described as slight, means the values are not equal, and this difference is
        part of the reason for the NO answer, this does not qualify as equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a difference
        in positions (Oscoda being "further north" than Kalkaska), not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in
        their positions, with Oscoda being in the 2nd tier and Kalkaska in the 3rd
        tier of counties.

        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the response doesn't mention the counties
        being at equal positions - it actually states they are in different positions
        relative to each other.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes with NO, it's not because
        the values (positions) are equal. Rather, it explains that the counties are
        east-west of each other, meaning they have different positions. The NO is
        based on neither being north of the other due to their east-west arrangement,
        not because they're at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        counties are in the same location. The model explicitly states they are in
        different positions, with Faribault County being "directly above" Freeborn
        County. The NO answer is given because the directional relationship is reversed
        from what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a definitive comparative answer about the relative positions of the counties,

        this equality is given as the primary reason for the NO answer ("Since Gaston
        County is not located north of Washita County (they're at virtually the same
        latitude), the answer must be no.")
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this was a clear comparative result stating that one location
        is not north of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they are "almost exactly the
        same latitude," it explicitly states there is a difference ("very slightly
        to the south"). The NO answer is based on this tiny difference, not on them
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Gaston County is "very slightly to the south of Washita County"

        \ might be very slightly further north\" - indicating a tiny difference exists.\
        \ Since any difference, even if described as slight, means they're not exactly\
        \ equal, this doesn't qualify as equal values being the primary reason for\

      explanation_equal_values: While the model states they are "at almost exactly
        the same latitude", it also specifies that Gaston County is "very slightly
        south if anything". Since it notes this tiny directional difference rather
        than pure equality as the reason for NO, this does not qualify as equal values
        being the primary reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Gaston County is north of Washita County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Borden County is
        "to the west of Fisher County", indicating a difference in position rather
        than equality. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference,
        not on equal values.
