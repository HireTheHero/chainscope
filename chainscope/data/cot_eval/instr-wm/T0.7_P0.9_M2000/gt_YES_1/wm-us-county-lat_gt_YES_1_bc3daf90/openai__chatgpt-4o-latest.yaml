      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Yamhill County
        is west of Clackamas County" and "Yamhill County is also slightly south of
        parts of Clackamas County." The NO answer is based on directional differences,
        not equality.

        "Parts of Clackamas County extend farther north than Yamhill County" and "Yamhill
        County is not located north of Clackamas County." The model is indicating
        a directional difference, not equality.

        north than Yamhill County does." This indicates a difference in northerly
        position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        as the reason for its NO answer, stating "Yamhill County lies mostly west
        of Clackamas County, not north." This indicates a specific directional difference
        (west vs. north) rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        for the NO answer, specifically stating that "Imperial County is primarily
        east of San Diego County, not north of it." This indicates a directional difference
        (east vs. north) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is **NO**"

        County is not distinctly north of San Diego County but rather east of it"
        as the reason for its NO answer. The model is noting a directional difference
        (east rather than north) as the reason for its answer, not equality.

        farther north" and "much of Imperial County lies at a similar or slightly
        lower latitude than parts of San Diego County." This indicates a comparison
        where there are some differences (parts at "slightly lower latitude"), not
        that they are exactly equal. The model is noting relative positioning differences,
        not equality.

        or the same. In fact, it notes that "Imperial County does extend slightly
        further north in some areas." The model gives NO as its answer because Imperial
        County is "primarily east and only slightly extends northward in some areas"
        rather than because the counties are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the best answer is **NO**"

        are at approximately the same latitude (roughly equal in their north-south

        east of Scurry County." The model concludes that "neither is distinctly north
        or south of the other" - suggesting they are at similar latitudes but not
        stating they are exactly equal. Since the model notes a difference in position
        (east-west) and doesn't explicitly state equality as the reason for its NO
