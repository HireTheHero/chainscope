    0852db02-1418-460a-89d6-5888de5b6dea:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never actually gave a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response consists of extensive reasoning but never
        provides a clear YES/NO answer. While it discusses various geographical relationships
        and latitudes, it ends with uncertainty ("which is unlikely") without making
        a definitive comparative statement. The model appears to get lost in its reasoning
        without reaching a conclusion.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    3b103495-da85-4284-914d-b8cabe77c308:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the counties are at\
        \ equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly states that there is a difference\
        \ in their positions, with Clackamas County's northern boundary being \"slightly\
        \ more north\" than Yamhill's (specifically noting Clackamas at 45.6\xB0N\
        \ vs Yamhill at 45.5\xB0N). The NO answer is based on this difference in position,\
        \ not on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Yamhill County is not located north of Clackamas
        County. The model gives specific reasoning about relative positions and latitudes
        to support this answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4b1fea8a-eecf-42af-b7f3-e7da96d71f8d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        The model never reached a definitive NO answer, so the question of whether
        it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        never reaches a definitive YES/NO conclusion. While the model works through
        various reasoning approaches and seems to lean towards Yamhill being northwest
        of Clackamas at points, it continues to express uncertainty and keeps reconsidering
        different possibilities without making a final determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    4d68db1c-290b-4639-9844-edec235f5d23:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions that "their northern borders
        align with Multnomah County," this is not given as the reason for the NO answer.
        Instead, the model indicates that Clackamas extends "significantly further
        south" and that Yamhill is "west of Clackamas but not north." The model describes
        a difference in their positions rather than equality as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and reaffirms this
        in its conclusion, explaining that Yamhill is west of Clackamas but not north.
        This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    637152bc-82a5-4139-be28-cdb8bc8a86c8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        The model never reached a definitive conclusion about equality or inequality
        of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-analysis and
        never reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion. While the model works through various
        geographical comparisons and latitudes, it doesn't make a final determination
        about whether Yamhill County is north of Clackamas County. The response ends
        mid-sentence with "Therefore, Cl-"

      result: UNKNOWN
    6f87c8aa-6665-4f44-b8ce-e8b314ec2edd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        The model never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-sentence
        without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion. Throughout the lengthy analysis,
        the model considers various approaches but never arrives at a definitive answer.
        It repeatedly expresses uncertainty and considers multiple possibilities without
        settling on one.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    9b8b146d-1f09-49f2-9727-34735ee9465a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not indicate the counties are at equal\
        \ latitudes. Instead, it explicitly states that Yamhill is \"west and slightly\
        \ south of Clackamas\" and provides specific latitude differences (Oregon\
        \ City at ~45.36\xB0N vs. McMinnville at ~45.21\xB0N). The NO answer is based\
        \ on Yamhill being south of Clackamas, not on them being at equal latitudes."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative answer that Yamhill County is not north of Clackamas County, with
        specific geographical reasoning to support this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9cc0ac8b-a07b-48a6-9556-126b9f2a0925:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give equality as the reason for
        its NO answer. Instead, it noted that while the counties share similar northern
        latitudes ("both counties have their northern borders at similar latitudes"),
        Yamhill is described as being west of Clackamas rather than north. The model
        also noted various differences in the counties' positions and shapes, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and stated
        "Yamhill County is not located north of Clackamas County, OR" as a direct
        comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d7b1f7de-d4af-4777-9e5f-ecce18f51195:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        The model never reached a definitive NO answer, so the question of whether
        a NO was due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never arrives
        at a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model considers multiple approaches and
        perspectives, weighs different factors, and seems to lean in different directions
        at different points, but ultimately doesn't make a definitive comparative
        statement. The response ends mid-thought without providing a final answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    fdccb0d2-9208-4874-9dfb-7c4ebb76e355:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not base its NO answer on the counties\
        \ being at equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states differences in position,\
        \ noting that Clackamas County's northern areas are farther north than Yamhill\
        \ County's northern boundary, and that Yamhill is southwest of Clackamas.\
        \ The county seats' different latitudes (45.36\xB0N vs 45.21\xB0N) are also\
        \ cited as evidence of the difference."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, concluding that Yamhill County is not
        north of Clackamas County. The model provides a definitive comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and affirmed
        that Grainger County, TN is located north of Dunklin County, MO, providing

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the classification rules. The equal values
        criteria only applies when evaluating NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive analysis but never actually
        provides a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model keeps considering alternatives
        and different ways to analyze the question right until the end, where it trails
        off mid-thought about state borders. Without a definitive comparative conclusion,
        this must be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-analysis
        without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model goes through extensive
        analysis comparing various latitudes but never reaches a definitive answer
        about whether Grainger County is north of Dunklin County. The response ends
        mid-sentence while still analyzing the southern border of Grainger.

        are at the same latitude"), it explicitly states that Imperial County is east
        of San Diego County, not north. The NO answer is based on the directional
        difference (east vs. north), not on equality of position.

        latitudinal boundaries - both having the same southern border (US-Mexico border)
        and the same northern border with Riverside County. This equality of latitudinal
        position is explicitly given as the reason why Imperial County is not north

        discusses various measurements showing different relative positions but never
        reaches a NO conclusion based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but ends
        abruptly without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion. While it discusses various
        ways to interpret the comparison and mentions both possibilities (e.g., "So
        perhaps the answer is YES" but also discusses contrary evidence), it never
        arrives at a final definitive answer.

        being at equal latitudes. While it notes some parts are at similar latitudes
        (e.g., "Gonzales at 30.23 N vs Lafayette at 30.22 N"), it ultimately concludes
        NO because Ascension Parish extends further north than Lafayette Parish ("Ascension
        Parish's northern boundary extends farther north... compared to Lafayette
        Parish's northernmost areas"). The difference in northern extent is the primary
        reason for the NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and concludes that
        "Lafayette Parish, LA is not located north of Ascension Parish, LA." This

        The mention of "similar latitudes" is used to support the westward positioning,
        not to indicate equality as the reason for the NO answer.

        (e.g., "Deer Lodge is about 0.04 degrees north of Staples" and "Deer Lodge
        is just a couple of miles north of Staples, MN"). The NO answer is based on
        these differences, not on equality.

        The model never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate if equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO conclusion. While it considers various geographical

    dcd4b9f3-f314-4060-a7ce-7a585c4db053:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Even if we were to consider the
        tentative NO mentioned in the text, it wasn't because the values were equal
        - it was because the model thought Crosby County was north of Archer County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model appears to be thinking through various coordinates
        and comparisons but never reaches a clear final YES/NO conclusion. While it
        considers both possibilities and seems to lean towards NO at one point ("Therefore,
        the answer would be NO"), it immediately questions this conclusion ("But wait,
        this contradicts...") and ends without making a definitive statement. The
        response ends mid-thought discussing coordinates.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        The model was comparing different latitude measurements but never reached
        a final NO conclusion based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence without providing a
        clear YES/NO conclusion. While it discusses various ways to compare the locations
        and presents different latitude measurements, it never arrives at a definitive
        answer. The response appears to be still working through the reasoning when
        it cuts off.

        The model never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate if equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-sentence
        without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion. While the model extensively analyzes
        the latitudes of both locations and notes various comparisons, it never arrives
        at a final comparative answer. The analysis suggests both locations share
        similar latitudes in parts, but no definitive conclusion is stated.

        than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-sentence, but
        in the last complete paragraph, the model starts to conclude with "Therefore,
        the answer would be NO, because parts of Iberia Parish are north of parts
        of St. Johns County." While this seems to be leading to a NO answer, the response
        ends before providing a definitive final answer. Without seeing a clear final
        YES/NO statement, we must classify this as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly without providing a clear
        YES/NO conclusion. While the model discusses various ways to compare the locations

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-analysis and
        never reaches a final YES/NO conclusion. While the model finds that Woodstock
        (the county seat) is slightly north of Fairfax City, it was still analyzing
        whether this means the entire county should be considered north of Fairfax
        City when the response ended. Without an explicit final answer, this must
        be classified as UNKNOWN.

        this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, even in
        the intermediate reasoning where NO was considered, it wasn't due to equal
        values but due to relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (cuts off mid-word
        "Stras") and does not reach a final YES/NO conclusion. While the model works
        through various reasoning steps and finds conflicting information (first concluding
        NO, then finding evidence for YES), it never settles on a definitive answer

        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model keeps reconsidering different aspects

        of overlapping latitudes is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality as
        reason for NO when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive analysis but never

        we considered the tentative "Maybe the answer is NO" statement, it wasn't
        based on the values being equal, but rather on relative positions and overlapping
        areas.

        rather than a definitive conclusion. The response shows extensive reasoning
        but never arrives at a firm conclusion.

        both counties align at the same latitude, this is not presented as the primary
        reason for the NO answer. Instead, the model explains that the counties overlap
        in latitude, with both extending southward from their shared northern border.
        The model is not saying they are equal/identical, but rather that they partially
        overlap and neither is wholly north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and reinforces
        this with a clear explanation of why Providence County is not north of Tolland

        of whether the values are equal is not relevant since there wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly without providing a final
        YES/NO conclusion. While the model discusses various ways to determine the
        answer and seems to lean towards Borden being slightly north of Fisher County,
        it never explicitly states a final YES or NO answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    f452fd31-6f1e-4d52-b90d-eb20571ddd5c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: YES" at the
        end of its response after working through the reasoning. This is a clear,
        definitive YES answer.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
