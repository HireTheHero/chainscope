    028506a9-412a-4338-8633-fb0cceae4b00:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it indicates there is a slight difference ("slightly
        north") but concludes NO because it's "not distinctly north in a straightforward
        north-south line comparison." Since it acknowledges a difference in position
        rather than equality, this doesn't qualify as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is NO"
        as its final conclusion. While it notes the location is "slightly north,"
        it clearly gives NO as its definitive answer to whether Yamhill County is
        located north of Clackamas County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    07b6b63a-3ab2-485d-9a98-c38126c596b1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same latitude or equally positioned. Instead, it indicates that Yamhill
        County is to the west and that its northern border does not extend north of
        Clackamas County's northern border. The NO answer is based on relative positioning,
        not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the counties.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    23ee7bdb-ef6c-4b39-aa53-23383b2c01e4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        counties are in the same location. Instead, the model explicitly states that
        Yamhill County is "situated to the west of Clackamas County" - indicating
        a difference in position, not equality. The NO answer was based on directional
        difference (west vs north), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Yamhill
        County is not located north of Clackamas County" as its final answer. This
        is a direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    449472e3-34d4-48e9-9e34-3fcef5093921:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same latitude or equally north/south. Instead, it specifically states
        that "Yamhill County is situated more to the west and slightly to the south
        compared to Clackamas County." The NO answer is based on a difference in position
        (Yamhill being south of Clackamas), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion after analyzing the relative positions of the counties. This
        is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5246df9c-838e-458d-bccc-dbfac4be8efe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly states that "Clackamas County extends
        farther north than Yamhill County" - indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes "Yamhill County, OR is not located north of Clackamas
        County, OR." This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    52e3b568-18da-451f-8179-7ec72f57a695:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same latitude or equal position. Instead, it explains that Yamhill County
        is situated to the west of Clackamas County, indicating a different relative
        position. The NO answer is based on their relative positions being west/east
        rather than north/south, not because they are at equal latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "the answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its analysis of the relative positions
        of the counties.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7e9bda0c-e41d-4d89-9268-213357617d70:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates the counties are "roughly
        aligned" and have "similar latitudinal positions," it doesn't explicitly state
        they are exactly equal/identical. The model describes them as being aligned
        east-west but doesn't use this equality as the primary reason for the NO answer.
        The description allows for some variation in their positions while still being
        "roughly" aligned.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion after comparing the locations. This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    96b887fc-0298-4e20-9491-6cac169e9005:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the counties are at the same latitude. Instead, it specifically states that
        Yamhill County is "positioned to the west and slightly south" of Clackamas
        County. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing geographical reasoning for why Yamhill
        County is not north of Clackamas County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a644c3c9-4008-4ab6-b720-64e8dbe1b98b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same latitude. Instead, it indicates that Yamhill County is "slightly
        to the north" but "west of Clackamas County." Since it notes a difference
        in position (even if slight) and the NO answer appears to be because they're
        not directly north of each other rather than being at equal latitude, this
        does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Yamhill County is
        not located north of Clackamas County" as its final answer. This is a clear
        NO comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e0f2c030-2732-483f-ad6e-b51d11d911c1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        counties are at the same latitude. Instead, the model explained that they
        are adjacent in an east-west direction, with Yamhill being to the west of
        Clackamas. The NO answer was based on their relative positions being different,
        not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct response to whether Yamhill County
        is north of Clackamas County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    0ba07aa3-e004-434e-95f8-d39a7d41c68b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are at the same latitude. The model explicitly states that Grainger
        County is south of Dunklin County, indicating a difference in latitude. The
        NO answer was given because of this directional difference, not because of
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Grainger County, TN is not north of Dunklin County, MO (it's
        south). This is a direct comparative answer to the original question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    0cd62367-e5ec-41c2-b447-7f0bb7512d8b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - rather, it explicitly states that Grainger County is south of
        Dunklin County. The model indicates there is a directional difference between
        their positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Grainger County, TN is north of Dunklin County, MO.
        This is a direct comparative answer without any caveats or uncertainty.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: "The model explicitly states that Grainger County\
        \ is \"slightly south\" of Dunklin County and provides different latitude\
        \ values (36\xB015'N vs 36\xB030'N). The NO answer is based on this difference,\
        \ not on equality of values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Grainger County, TN
        is not located north of Dunklin County, MO" as its final answer, providing
        a direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    59391aa6-6e6a-453d-8232-b63c9bcca6c2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        the same latitude or equal position. Instead, it explained that Dunklin County
        is "still generally north of most of Tennessee" despite Grainger being in
        northern Tennessee. The NO answer was based on relative positions being different,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, Grainger
        County, TN is not located north of Dunklin County, MO." This is a clear comparative
        NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration only applies
        when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: YES" at
        the end of its step-by-step analysis'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not needed when
        the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

    7513121a-639b-4a81-9193-ab0827ee2ddd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

    c53f4165-0284-4a41-b9ec-9fb34c76e755:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitude. Instead, it explicitly indicates that Grainger County is south
        of Dunklin County, showing a directional difference. The NO answer is based
        on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Grainger County, TN is located north of Dunklin County,
        MO. The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because Grainger County is determined
        to be south of Dunklin County, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion after comparing the locations. This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same latitude or equally positioned. Instead, it describes Imperial County
        as being "to the east and slightly north of San Diego County's central area"
        but concludes NO based on there not being a clear northern positioning relative
        to the entirety of San Diego County. Since it notes a directional difference
        (even if slight) and doesn't base its NO answer on equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Imperial
        County is not located north of San Diego County." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    5d75b08d-136e-410f-a3c2-d4d00c1ce628:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same latitude or otherwise equal in position. Instead, it states that
        Imperial County is "east of San Diego County" and gives directional difference
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "the answer
        is NO" and confirms "Imperial County is not located north of San Diego County."
        This is a direct NO comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    783d7ea8-bea9-4902-8ba5-419d3372aa31:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they are "at a similar latitude,"
        it also notes Imperial County is "slightly south compared to parts of San
        Diego County." Since it indicates there is a directional difference (slightly
        south), even if small, this does not qualify as stating they are exactly equal
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "the answer
        is NO" and "Imperial County is not located north of San Diego County" as its
        final comparative conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states Imperial County
        is east of San Diego County, indicating different positions. The NO was based
        on directional difference (east rather than north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Imperial
        County, CA is not located north of San Diego County, CA" as its final answer.
        This is a direct comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it explains that Imperial County is "directly east"
        of San Diego County. The NO answer is based on relative positioning (being
        east rather than north), not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Imperial
        County is not located north of San Diego County" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the counties
        being in the same position - rather, it explicitly states that Imperial County
        is east of San Diego County, indicating a clear directional difference. The
        NO is based on Imperial being east rather than north, not on the counties
        being at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        latitudes. Instead, it explicitly states that "San Diego County is generally
        situated at a slightly higher latitude than Imperial County." The NO answer
        is based on a difference in position, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same latitude or otherwise equal in position. Instead, it states there
        are directional differences, describing Imperial County as "east and slightly
        to the north" of San Diego County. The NO answer is based on Imperial County
        being "primarily east" rather than being at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO. Imperial
        County, CA is not located north of San Diego County, CA. It is primarily east
        of it." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Both counties are roughly at
        the same latitude" and bases its NO answer on the fact that "their latitudinal
        positions are approximately the same" with "neither county distinctly north
        of the other." This equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Both counties are roughly at
        the same latitude" (approximately 36 degrees North) and uses this equality
        as the primary reason for its NO answer, saying "so Izard County, AR is not
        definitively north of Guilford County, NC."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the latitudes of both counties.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not relevant since
        we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        Instead, the model's primary reasoning is that Steele County is west of Waseca
        County, not north. The mention of similar latitude is secondary to this directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that "Steele County, MN is not located
        north of Waseca County, MN."

        the counties are in the same location. The model explicitly states that Steele
        County is "located to the south of Waseca County," indicating a clear directional
        difference between their positions. The NO answer was given because of this
        directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the geographic positioning
        of the two counties. The model states that Steele County is south of Waseca
        County, not north of it.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions that the counties are "roughly
        aligned east-west with each other," this is not given as the reason for the
        NO answer. Instead, the model states that Brown County is "directly to the
        east" and "is not positioned to the north" of Outagamie County, indicating
        a clear directional difference rather than equality as the reason for the
        NO answer.

        clearly indicating that Borden County is not north of Fisher County. The answer
        is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a5c32f5e-4bc4-4e57-8243-8acd66063089:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Borden
        County is southwest of Fisher County, not because the locations are equal.
        It explicitly states there is a directional difference between the counties.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" after
        determining that Borden County is southwest of Fisher County, providing a
        definitive comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d79d97fd-e2ca-45ad-9191-8e50e4b7a74e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same location or latitude. Instead, it explicitly states that "Borden
        County is located further south compared to Fisher County" - indicating a
        difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Borden County, TX is
        not located north of Fisher County, TX" as its final answer, providing a direct
        comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e580b094-71b9-487f-8872-f79eccb2264a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the counties are at the same location. The model explicitly states that Fisher
        County is northeast of Borden County, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was given because Borden County is south of Fisher County, not
        because they are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result that Borden County is
        not north of Fisher County (stating it is south instead).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
