    46e48f5e-8bee-4d60-a0e3-931234ce42df:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same latitude or position. Instead, it explains that Yamhill County is
        "primarily west and slightly south of Clackamas County." The model notes a
        directional difference (slightly south), not equality, as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Yamhill County is
        not located north of Clackamas County" as its final answer. This is a clear
        negative response to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same location or have equal positions. Instead, it explains that "Parts
        of Clackamas County extend further north than Yamhill County" and that "Yamhill
        County is generally to the west and slightly north of Clackamas County" but
        also notes that "Clackamas County also extends further north than Yamhill
        County." The model is describing a difference in positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Yamhill County is located north of Clackamas County. The answer
        is explicitly stated at the end of the response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same latitude or have equal north-south positions. Instead, it explains
        that "Yamhill County is primarily located to the west of Clackamas County,
        with some overlap in their north-south positioning." The model notes there
        is "some overlap" but primarily describes a different positioning (west rather
        than north), not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Yamhill County, OR
        is not located north of Clackamas County, OR." This is a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (positions)
        are equal. Instead, it explains that "Yamhill County is generally positioned
        to the west and slightly north of Clackamas County" and that "Yamhill County
        is not directly north of Clackamas County. It's more to the northwest or west
        of Clackamas County." The model is noting a difference in positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question about whether Yamhill County is north of Clackamas
        County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same location or have equal positions. Instead, it explains that "Clackamas
        County extends further north than Yamhill County" and "Yamhill County is not
        located north of Clackamas County." The model is indicating a difference in
        their relative positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Yamhill County is located north of Clackamas County. The answer
        is clearly stated at the end of the response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in the positions
        of the counties, stating "Clackamas County extends further north than Yamhill
        County" and "Yamhill County does not extend as far north as the northern parts
        of Clackamas County." The model is clearly indicating a difference in northward
        extension between the counties as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7e911fd8-69f3-4405-9924-4494dc16f299:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same latitude or equal in position. Instead, it explains that "While Yamhill
        County extends somewhat north of parts of Clackamas County, the majority of
        Yamhill County is actually positioned to the west, not directly north of Clackamas
        County." This indicates a difference in position (primarily west rather than
        north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question about
        whether Yamhill County is north of Clackamas County.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    a05e7ae7-e1db-4d49-a658-fe86fec1d6b7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Yamhill County is
        "to the west and slightly south of Clackamas County," indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice in its final
        conclusion. After initially saying "Yamhill County is indeed positioned slightly
        north of Clackamas County," it corrects itself and concludes "Yamhill County
        is actually positioned to the west and slightly south of Clackamas County"
        and gives a final answer of "NO".
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e712c2a6-1dd3-4ef7-92db-448cd9d9c5cb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are in
        the same position or have equal values. Instead, it explains that "Yamhill
        County is primarily west and slightly north of Clackamas County" and that
        "The northern boundary of Clackamas County extends further north than most
        of Yamhill County." The model is noting differences in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        concluding that "Yamhill County is not located north of Clackamas County."
        The model provides a definitive comparative judgment.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same latitude or position. Instead, it explains that "Yamhill County is
        primarily west and slightly south of Clackamas County." The model also mentions
        that "Yamhill County is mostly at the same latitude as the southern portions
        of Clackamas County, with some overlap, but Clackamas County extends further
        north into the Portland area." This indicates a difference in position (Yamhill
        being slightly south and Clackamas extending further north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Yamhill County,
        OR is not located north of Clackamas County, OR." This is a clear negative
        answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Grainger County is south of
        Dunklin County, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Grainger County,
        TN is not located north of Dunklin County, MO. It is located south of it."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        question is automatically False according to the instructions ("If the final
        answer was not NO: put False in the answer").'
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a "NO" answer, but then corrected
        itself after "double-checking" and explicitly stated "YES, Grainger County,
        TN is located north of Dunklin County, MO" as its final conclusion.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that the counties are "roughly at
        similar latitudes" and "approximately at the same latitude" as the reason
        for its NO answer. It even says Grainger County is "possibly being slightly
        south or at approximately the same latitude." Since the model's primary reason
        for the NO answer is that the locations are approximately at the same latitude
        (equal values), this meets the criteria for True.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Grainger County,
        TN is not located north of Dunklin County, MO" as its final answer. This is
        a clear NO response to the comparative question.

      result: 'NO'
    4c90fcca-afef-4e14-9d42-2be085e1ea50:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "they are roughly at similar
        latitudes, with Anne Arundel extending slightly more northward." This indicates
        that the counties are not exactly equal in latitude - there is a slight difference
        with Anne Arundel actually extending more northward. The model is not saying
        NO because the values are exactly the same, but because Hardy County is not
        north of Anne Arundel (in fact, Anne Arundel extends slightly more north).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Hardy County, WV is not north of Anne Arundel County,
        MD. This is a clear negative comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    56d2784a-325c-418f-9b46-85ab819c21ef:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Hardy County is "slightly south
        of Anne Arundel County's latitude." This indicates a difference in values
        (one is south of the other), not equality. The model is giving a directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its final answer paragraph, indicating that Hardy County, WV is not located
        north of Anne Arundel County, MD. This is a clear negative response to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5d8accbf-3e76-4d79-974a-32c447a615f1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it notes a difference in position, stating
        "Hardy County is generally positioned to the west and slightly south of Anne
        Arundel County, not north of it." The model is indicating a directional difference
        (slightly south) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clear and definitive at the end
        of the response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        is automatically False according to the instructions ("If the final answer
        was not NO: put False in the answer").'
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a "NO" answer, but then reconsidered
        and explicitly stated "YES, Hardy County, WV IS located north of Anne Arundel
        County, MD" as its final conclusion. The model clearly changed its mind and
        ended with a definitive YES.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    8dece274-dcc0-4c4f-b739-cf719958977d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Hardy County is south of
        Anne Arundel County, indicating a directional difference between their positions.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Hardy County, WV is
        actually south of Anne Arundel County, MD" and then explicitly states "NO"
        at the end of its response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Hardy County is
        located south of Anne Arundel County, indicating a directional difference
        between their positions. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Hardy County, WV is
        not located north of Anne Arundel County, MD. It is located south of it."
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Hardy County, WV is located
        north of Anne Arundel County, MD" and then answers "NO". The model is identifying
        a directional difference (north vs. south) between the counties, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographical positions of Hardy County and Anne Arundel
        County.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Dade County "is at approximately the
        same latitude as the southern part of San Bernardino County, while the northern
        part of San Bernardino County extends further north." This indicates a partial
        overlap or similarity in latitude, not complete equality. The model is noting
        that San Bernardino County extends further north than Dade County, which is
        a difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Dade County, GA is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it states that they "overlap in latitude
        range" and that "Dade County is not definitively north of the entirety of
        San Bernardino County." This indicates a partial overlap rather than equality,
        which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        within the latitude range of San Bernardino County, and San Bernardino County
        extends further north than Dade County." This indicates a difference in values
        (San Bernardino extends further north), not equality, as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Dade County is not

        Ballard County being slightly north or at nearly the same latitude as Santa
        Cruz County." Since it notes that Ballard County is "slightly north" (indicating

        north of Refugio County." This indicates a difference in values (even if slight),
        not equality. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its final answer paragraph, making a clear comparative judgment that "Refugio

        County" and "Hendricks County is slightly more northern overall in its positioning."
        The model's NO answer is based on these differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        not equality. The model is saying NO because Parke is northwest rather than
        directly north, not because they're at identical latitudes.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, it contradicts itself
        by first saying "they are at approximately the same latitude" but then concluding
        "Claiborne Parish is slightly more north than Morehouse Parish." Since the
        model indicates there is a difference (even if described as "slightly"), this
        is not a case where equality is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        is not north of Morehouse; they are at similar latitudes but different longitudes."
        The model explicitly states they are "at approximately the same latitude"
        and "at similar latitudes," indicating that the values being compared (their
        latitudes) are the same, and this equality is the primary reason for the NO
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "they are at the same latitude"
        as the reason for its NO answer. It explicitly says they are at the same latitude
        (equal in north-south positioning) and that their relationship is east-west
        (Swisher County is to the west and Briscoe County is to the east). The equality
        in latitude is the primary reason given for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Swisher County and Briscoe
        County are at approximately the same latitude, with neither being significantly
        north of the other." This explanation indicates that the model is saying NO
        because the counties are at approximately the same latitude (equal in terms
        of northerly position). The equality of their positions is the primary reason
        given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This indicates that the model is answering "NO"
        to the comparative question about whether Swisher County is north of Briscoe
        County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Swisher County is "directly west of Briscoe
        County" and they are "at approximately the same latitude." The model concludes
        NO because Swisher County is west, not north of Briscoe County. While it mentions
        they are at "roughly the same latitude," this is not presented as the reason
        for the NO answer - the directional difference (west vs. north) is the primary
        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning that Swisher County is not north of Briscoe County. The answer
        is clear and definitive.

        rather than having a north-south relationship. The NO answer is based on the
        counties being at approximately the same latitude (equal in terms of north-south
        positioning), which is the primary reason given for the NO answer.

        This indicates a slight difference in latitude (the northeast direction implies

        in Virginia than Shenandoah County" and concludes with "NO". This is a definitive
        comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes differences in their positions, stating
        that "Collier County is positioned to the west and slightly north of Miami-Dade
        County" and "Collier County does extend further north than Miami-Dade County."
        These are clear differences in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment about the
        relative positions of Collier County and Miami-Dade County.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "Collier County is located
        to the west and partially overlaps with Miami-Dade County in terms of latitude,
        but Collier County does not lie entirely north of Miami-Dade County." The
        model is noting a partial overlap rather than equality, and specifically mentions
        that Collier County is west of Miami-Dade.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Collier County, FL
        is not located north of Miami-Dade County, FL." This is a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same latitude or have equal north-south positions. In fact, it states
        "Collier does extend somewhat further north than Miami-Dade," indicating they
        are not at the same latitude. The model's NO answer is based on the overall
        geographical relationship (being "side by side" rather than one being fully
        north of the other), not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Collier County, FL

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "Collier County is located to the west and northwest of Miami-Dade
        County." This indicates a directional difference rather than equality. Additionally,
        there's a contradiction in the model's reasoning, as it first states in step
        5 that "Collier County is indeed situated at a higher latitude than Miami-Dade
        County" but then concludes the opposite. Regardless of this contradiction,
        the model does not base its NO answer on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its final answer, indicating that Collier County, FL is not located north
        of Miami-Dade County, FL. This is a clear negative comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same latitude or equally north/south. Instead, it explains they have "primarily
        an east-west relationship" and even notes that "Collier County does extend
        farther north than Miami-Dade County" in step 6, indicating they are not at
        the same latitude. The NO answer is based on their primary arrangement being
        east-west rather than north-south, not because they are at equal latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Collier County, FL
        is not located north of Miami-Dade County, FL." This is a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.

        equal. Instead, it says they are "at roughly similar latitudes" but then notes
        differences, specifically that "parts of Collier County are slightly north
        of parts of Miami-Dade County." Since the model indicates there are differences
        in position (even if slight), this does not qualify as stating the values
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its final answer paragraph, indicating that Collier County, FL is not located

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Wibaux County is in eastern
        Montana near the middle of the Montana-North Dakota border, while Golden Valley
        County is in the southwestern part of North Dakota, which would place it further
        south than Wibaux County. The model is noting a difference in position (with
        Wibaux being further north), not equality.

        in latitude. Instead, it states "They are at approximately the same latitude,
        with Denton County possibly being slightly further north." This indicates
        a slight difference rather than exact equality, with Denton County actually
        being slightly north of Bamberg County. Since the model notes a difference
        (even if slight), this is not a case where the NO answer is based on equal
        values.

        a difference in the values (even if described as "slight"), which is the reason
        for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, it contradicts itself - first
        saying "Bamberg County is slightly further north than Denton County" but then
        in the conclusion saying "Denton County possibly being slightly further north".
        Either way, it notes a slight difference between the locations rather than
        stating they are exactly the same, and this difference (whichever direction)
        is part of its reasoning for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to

        question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - it actually concluded the opposite,
        that one location is slightly north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then reconsidered
        and gave a final answer of "YES" at the end of its response, stating "YES
        (Bamberg County, SC is slightly north of Denton County, TX)". This is a clear

        but Bamberg County is actually slightly south of Denton County." The model
        notes a directional difference (slightly south), which means it's not claiming
        equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Bamberg County, SC
        is not located north of Denton County, TX" as its final answer. This is a

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "They are at approximately the
        same latitude, with Denton County possibly being slightly further north."
        This indicates that the model is saying NO because the counties are at approximately
        the same latitude, with a possibility that the relationship is actually the
        opposite of what was asked (Denton might be slightly north of Bamberg, not
        Bamberg north of Denton). Since the model is claiming the values are approximately
        equal (same latitude) as the primary reason for its NO answer, this meets
        the criteria for True.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Bamberg County,
        SC is not located north of Denton County, TX" as its final answer. This is
        a clear negative response to the comparative question.

        County is positioned to the east and slightly north of Sarasota County" and
        "Highlands County is indeed slightly north of Sarasota County, though it's
        more directly east than north." This indicates the model recognizes a difference
        in position (Highlands being slightly north), but still answers NO, likely
        because it considers the east-west difference more significant than the north-south
        difference.

        extending slightly further north." This indicates a slight difference in their
        positions, not exact equality. The model is noting a potential small difference,
        which means it's not basing the NO answer purely on the values being exactly
        the same.

        final answer, it states "Patrick County, VA is not located north of Chesapeake
        City, VA. It is actually located west and slightly south of Chesapeake." Since
        the model clearly states "NO" as its comparative result, followed by an explanation
        that Patrick County is west and slightly south (not north) of Chesapeake,
        the final answer is NO.

        In fact, it states that "Chesapeake City is actually slightly further north

        The model is saying NO because Chesapeake is further north than Patrick County,
        not because they are at the same latitude.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically stating that "Borden County is directly west
        of Fisher County" and "not north of it." This indicates a clear directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Borden County is north of Fisher County. The model
        explains that Borden County is west of Fisher County, not north of it.
