      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same latitude or equal in position. Instead, it explains that "Yamhill
        County is primarily west, not north, of Clackamas County" and notes that "They
        are at similar latitudes, though Yamhill is actually slightly south of Clackamas."
        The model is indicating a directional difference (Yamhill being slightly south),
        not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Yamhill County is located north of Clackamas County. The answer
        is explicit and direct in the final line of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Yamhill County is not north
        of Clackamas County because "Clackamas County extends further north than Yamhill
        County" and "Yamhill County is positioned west and slightly south relative
        to Clackamas County." The model is indicating a difference in position, not
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explains that Imperial County is east of San Diego
        County, not north of it. While it mentions they are "at similar latitudes,"
        it clearly states a directional difference (east, not north) as the reason
        for the NO answer. The model is not saying NO because the counties are in
        the same location.

        is east of San Diego County, not north of it. The model notes a directional
        difference (east vs. north) as the reason for its NO answer, not because they
        are at the same latitude/longitude. While it does mention they are "at similar
        latitudes," it clearly states Imperial County is "to the east" which indicates
        a difference in position, not equality.

        at the same latitude" and that Imperial County is "at approximately the same
        latitude" as San Diego County. The model's NO answer is based on this equality
        of latitude (north-south positioning), stating they are at the same latitude
        but Imperial County is to the east, not north. This equality of latitude is
        the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

        County is roughly at the same latitude as San Diego County, with some overlap,"
        this is not presented as the primary reason for the NO answer. Instead, the
        model's primary reasoning is directional - that Imperial County is to the
        east of San Diego County, not to the north. The model is noting a different

        at approximately the same latitude. The model explicitly states "They lie
        at approximately the same latitude" and earlier mentions "they are at approximately
        the same latitude, with Steele to the east of Waseca." This equality in latitude
        is the primary reason given for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional reasoning,
        not equality. The model explains that Steele County is east of Waseca County
        (not north), stating they are "at approximately the same latitude." This indicates
        a directional difference (east-west) rather than claiming the values being
        compared are exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        relative positions rather than as the reason for the NO answer. The model's
        reasoning is based on their relative positions to each other and surrounding
        counties, not on equality being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Kalkaska County is not
