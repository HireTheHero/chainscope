    354f7da7-990c-4274-ac4b-9ee188a42cea:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same latitude or equal in position. Instead, it explains that "Yamhill
        County is south and west of Clackamas County" and "Clackamas County is generally
        north and east of Yamhill County." The model is indicating a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Yamhill County is not
        located north of Clackamas County." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3628d61e-3265-48e0-a9aa-5cee38962ab4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same location or have equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that
        "Yamhill County is south and west of Clackamas County" and that "Clackamas
        County is generally positioned northeast of Yamhill County." The model is
        noting a difference in positions as the reason for its NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Yamhill County is not
        located north of Clackamas County, OR" as its final answer. This is an explicit
        NO response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    68812525-2c7f-4dcd-b4d7-ebcc28fe825f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it specifically states that Yamhill County
        is "northwest of Clackamas County, not directly north." The model is indicating
        a directional difference (northwest vs. north), not equality. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Yamhill County is not
        located north of Clackamas County, but rather northwest of it." This is an
        explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    78be8c61-5703-4c80-8a13-ba936322a5f3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same latitude or have equal north-south positions. Instead, it explicitly
        states that "Clackamas County is positioned more northerly in the state compared
        to Yamhill County" and that "Yamhill County is not north of Clackamas County."
        The model indicates there is a difference in their positions, with Clackamas
        being more north than Yamhill, which is why it answers NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question about whether Yamhill County is north of Clackamas County.
        The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response as "# Answer: NO".'

    7e7256ca-1891-4d09-bbb2-0763ace9fec3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        saying "Yamhill County is indeed located north (specifically northwest) of
        Clackamas County, Oregon."
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    821d65f7-e387-40b9-8628-5cc2d2bdaf31:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same latitude/position as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it explains
        that "Yamhill County is generally positioned to the west of Clackamas County,
        not north of it." The model notes they "partially overlap on the north-south
        axis" but gives directional difference (west vs. north) as the reason for
        the NO answer, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as its final answer to whether Yamhill County, OR is located north
        of Clackamas County, OR.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8654dbb9-268a-4b97-af8c-e788ffa5631f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Yamhill County is positioned
        to the southwest of Clackamas County, indicating a directional difference
        rather than equality. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on
        this directional difference (southwest vs. north), not on the counties being
        at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model is directly answering whether Yamhill
        County is north of Clackamas County with a definitive negative response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9549324c-2c12-4e21-8740-371cf29b5b90:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same latitude/position as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it explains
        that "Yamhill County is primarily positioned to the west and slightly northwest
        of Clackamas County" and that "most of Yamhill County is actually at approximately
        the same latitude or slightly south of the northern portions of Clackamas
        County." The model is noting directional differences, not equality, as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Yamhill County is not north of Clackamas
        County.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e7f74db2-2e3e-4190-8250-4f3929b12edc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are in
        the same location or have equal positions. Instead, it explains that "Yamhill
        County is located to the west and slightly northwest, but not directly north
        of Clackamas County." The model is noting a directional difference (west and
        slightly northwest vs. directly north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Yamhill County is
        not located north of Clackamas County." This is a clear negative answer to
        the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fad23224-33f6-4684-8656-6fce4867336e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same latitude or equal in position. Instead, it explains that "Yamhill
        County is primarily west of Clackamas County, not north of it" and notes there
        may be "some overlap in their northern-southern extents." The model is indicating
        a directional difference (primarily west) rather than equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Yamhill County is north of Clackamas County. The answer is clearly
        stated at the end of the response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        to whether Grainger County, TN is located north of Dunklin County, MO. The
        answer appears at the very end of the response after the model's step-by-step
        reasoning.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    080e47c1-a768-496c-9801-ba9ae34046e1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Grainger County is south
        of Dunklin County because Missouri is north of Tennessee, and even the southernmost
        part of Missouri (the Bootheel where Dunklin County is located) is still north
        of Tennessee. The model is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as its final answer to whether Grainger County, TN is located north
        of Dunklin County, MO.

    45aa887e-68c2-4363-b2eb-dc4c197969eb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it claims that "Grainger County, TN is NOT
        located north of Dunklin County, MO. It is actually south of Dunklin County."
        The model is asserting a directional difference (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Grainger County,
        TN is NOT located north of Dunklin County, MO." This is a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Grainger County
        is south of Dunklin County, indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Grainger County, TN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values being compared\
        \ are the same. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in the latitudes:\
        \ \"Grainger County, TN is at approximately 36.2\xB0N latitude\" and \"Dunklin\
        \ County, MO is at approximately 36.0\xB0N latitude\". This indicates a difference\
        \ of 0.2 degrees, with Grainger County being slightly north of Dunklin County.\
        \ The model's NO answer appears to contradict its own latitude comparison,\
        \ but I'm only evaluating what was stated, not resolving contradictions."
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit answer to the comparative
        question about whether Grainger County, TN is located north of Dunklin County,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Grainger County
        is actually south of Dunklin County," indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Grainger County
        is south of Dunklin County, indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Grainger County,
        TN is not located north of Dunklin County, MO. It is south of Dunklin County."

    0ab70a65-09e2-40bb-bccb-d94e5fdeaf35:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Imperial County is east of
        San Diego County, not north of it. The model notes a directional difference
        (east vs. north), not equality. In Step 3, it says "Both counties are at roughly
        the same latitude" but this is not presented as the primary reason for the
        NO answer - the primary reason given is that Imperial County is east, not
        north of San Diego County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Imperial County,
        CA is not located north of San Diego County, CA. It is located east of San
        Diego County." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

    2628b00c-feed-4b63-8bf5-f0af61fb58a0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Imperial County
        is located to the east of San Diego County, not to the north. The model is
        indicating a directional difference (east vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Imperial County, CA
        is not located north of San Diego County, CA. It is located to the east of

    4414b2c8-ff4a-4882-b1cf-5c38c9424cdc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        exactly the same latitude or position. While it mentions they are at "roughly
        similar latitudes," it also specifies that "Imperial County is positioned
        to the east rather than north of San Diego County." The model is indicating
        a directional difference (east) rather than claiming the counties are at identical
        positions. The NO answer is based on Imperial being east, not north, rather
        than being based on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Imperial
        County is not located north of San Diego County." This is a definitive NO
        answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    772bca0a-9eda-4e52-9eb3-402660715b18:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same latitude or exactly equal in position. Instead, it explains that
        Imperial County is "located to the east of San Diego County" rather than north.
        While it mentions they "generally share the same southern border," this is
        not given as the reason for the NO answer. The primary reason given is directional
        difference (east, not north).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Imperial County is not
        located north of San Diego County." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.

    876ab88c-1a23-4c41-9b46-8fb2596fada3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are exactly
        equal or identical in position. Instead, it says they are "roughly at the
        same latitude" but also notes that Imperial County is "mostly to the east,
        and in some parts slightly to the south of San Diego County." Since it indicates
        there is a slight difference (with Imperial being slightly south in some parts),
        this is not a case where the NO is based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Imperial County is north of San Diego County. This is an explicit
        negative comparative result.

        County are "at similar latitudes" and that Imperial County is "roughly at
        the same latitude but to the east" of San Diego County. The model's NO answer
        is based on the fact that Imperial County is east of San Diego County, not
        north of it, and that they are at approximately the same latitude. This indicates
        the model is saying the north-south values are essentially equal, which is
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Imperial County is north of San Diego County. The
        answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.

        similar latitudes," it specifically adds that "Anne Arundel County [is] positioned
        to the east and slightly north of Hardy County." Since it indicates Anne Arundel
        is "slightly north" (a directional difference), the values are not considered
        equal.

        mentions that "the northern border of Parke County is slightly north of the
        northern border of Hendricks County" and "the southern border of Parke County
        extends further south than Hendricks County." The model's primary reason for
        the NO answer is that Parke County is "located west of Hendricks County" rather
        than north of it, not that they are exactly equal in latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Parke County, IN
        is not located north of Hendricks County, IN." This is a clear negative answer

        is not clearly north of Hendricks County." The model indicates there is overlap
        rather than equality, and emphasizes that Parke County is "primarily west"
        of Hendricks County. Since the model doesn't claim the counties are at exactly
        the same latitude as the reason for its NO answer, this doesn't qualify as
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        specifically gives a different reason for the NO answer - that Parke County
        is located to the west of Hendricks County rather than north. The model indicates
        a directional difference (west-east relationship) rather than equality as
        the reason for its answer.

        of Hendricks County" and that "Parke County does extend further north than
        Hendricks County." The model's reason for saying NO is that Parke County is
        primarily to the west rather than directly north, not because they are at
        the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

    2431709b-fa10-4e97-8cc5-4ccafdd0cf85:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal. Instead, it says "Bamberg County, SC is approximately at the same latitude
        or slightly south of Denton County, TX." The phrase "or slightly south" indicates
        a potential difference in values, not exact equality. The model is suggesting
        Bamberg County might be at a lower latitude than Denton County, which is why
        it's not north of Denton County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response to the question "Is Bamberg County, SC located north of Denton County,
        TX?" This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

    35a5bb8f-6191-45eb-a9aa-863df9ae9cd3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states "Bamberg County, SC is slightly
        to the north of Denton County, TX by a small margin" which indicates a difference
        in values, even if described as "slight" or "small." This contradicts the
        NO answer (since if Bamberg is slightly north, the answer should be YES),
        but we're instructed not to resolve contradictions. Since the model notes
        a difference rather than equality, this doesn't qualify as a NO due to equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its conclusion.
        This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question of whether Bamberg
        County, SC is located north of Denton County, TX.

        the same latitude" and "Bamberg County is actually slightly south of or at
        approximately the same latitude as Denton County." While the model notes they
        are at approximately the same latitude, it also states that Bamberg County
        is "slightly south of" Denton County, indicating a small difference rather
        than exact equality. Since the model identifies a directional difference (slightly
        south), even if tiny, this is not a case where the NO answer is based purely
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        in latitude, with Rogers County being more northern, which is the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after analyzing the geographic positions of both counties. The model
        concludes that "Rogers County, OK is slightly farther north than Fentress
        County, TN" and therefore answers "NO" to the question of whether Fentress
        County is north of Rogers County.

        In fact, it explicitly states that "Charles County in Maryland is slightly

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Cherry County, NE is actually
        at roughly the same latitude as Chenango County, NY, or possibly slightly
        south of it." This indicates that the model is saying NO because the counties
        are at approximately the same latitude (or Cherry County might be slightly
        south). The equality of their positions (being at "roughly the same latitude")
        is presented as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values being compared\
        \ are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that there is a difference\
        \ in latitude: \"Gaston County, NC is located at approximately 35.3\xB0 N\
        \ latitude. Washita County, OK is located at approximately 35.4\xB0 N latitude.\"\
        \ The model concludes that \"Washita County is at a slightly higher latitude\
        \ than Gaston County\" and that \"Gaston County is positioned slightly south\

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model has determined that Gaston County is not north of Washita County, but
        rather is "positioned slightly south of Washita County."

      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values are exactly\

        \ similar latitudes\" (approximately 35.3\xB0 N for both), it specifically\
        \ states \"Washita County, OK is actually slightly north of Gaston County,\
        \ NC by a small margin.\" This indicates a difference in values, even if small,\
        \ rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Washita County, OK is not south of Gaston County,
        NC. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

    eba42873-6275-4c30-835b-efe6032bb2fc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "Gaston County in North Carolina is slightly
        south of Washita County in Oklahoma." The model notes a difference in position,
        even if described as "slight," which means it's not claiming the locations
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as its final answer to whether Gaston County, NC is located north
        of Washita County, OK. The model clearly indicates that Gaston County is slightly
        south of Washita County.
