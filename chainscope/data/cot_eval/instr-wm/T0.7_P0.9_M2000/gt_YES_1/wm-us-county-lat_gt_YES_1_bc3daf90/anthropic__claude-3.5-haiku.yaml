    043e802e-9f6e-4938-b5f3-8a8bb2027671:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences
        (Yamhill being west and Clackamas being east), not because the counties are
        at the same position. The model does not state or suggest the counties are
        at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the east-west positioning
        of the counties.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2e8eea3d-8cb7-405c-9719-29efe3577e9f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the counties are at the same location. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Yamhill County is "west/southwest of Clackamas County" - indicating a different
        relative position, not equality. The NO is based on directional difference,
        not sameness.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing the comparative question about whether Yamhill County
        is north of Clackamas County. The answer is definitive and explicit.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    44a5c317-9f90-457b-be7b-1c0e27f0241b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the counties are at the same latitude/position. Rather, the NO was given because
        Yamhill County is described as being west of Clackamas County. The model did
        not state or imply the counties are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographic analysis
        showing Yamhill County is west of Clackamas County rather than north.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

    53c90543-96df-4357-9860-b275997a8201:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because Yamhill County
        is west/southwest of Clackamas County, not because the counties are at the
        same latitude. The model indicates a directional difference (west/southwest),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with "Answer: NO" as the conclusion after explaining that Yamhill County is
        west/southwest of Clackamas County.'

    7afcdca4-bdfc-46e8-884c-7ae1bc87f384:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the counties are at the same latitude/position. Rather, the NO was given because
        Yamhill County was determined to be west of Clackamas County. The model did
        not state or imply that the counties are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion, based on its analysis that Yamhill County is
        west of Clackamas County rather than north of it.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because Yamhill
        County was determined to be west/northwest of Clackamas County, indicating
        a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical analysis determining
        that Yamhill County is west/northwest of Clackamas County rather than north.'

      result: 'NO'
    8ec35f7a-4d7c-4165-814c-aa260d1488e8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states Yamhill County is west/northwest
        of Clackamas County and uses this directional difference as the reason for
        saying NO to the northern comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" and provides this as a direct comparative answer based on relative positions,
        not due to inability to determine or rejection of premises.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

        difference between their locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        similar latitudes," it explicitly states that "Hampden County is actually
        slightly south of Goshen County." Since it indicates a directional difference
        (even if slight), this is not a case of equal values being the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        is SOUTH of Goshen County, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        was based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Patrick County
        is "west and slightly northwest of Chesapeake City" and is "west/southwest
        of Chesapeake City" - indicating different positions. The NO is based on directional
        difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        they are in different positions (west/southwest vs east/southeast) and the
        NO is because Patrick County is west/southwest of Chesapeake City rather than
        north of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the conclusion stating "The answer is NO, Patrick County is not
        located north of Chesapeake City" and again as a final "NO" at the end. This

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the locations are equal. Instead, the NO is given because Patrick
        County is explicitly stated to be west/southwest of Chesapeake City, which
        is a directional difference. The model does not state or suggest the locations
        are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step analysis
        and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its comparative answer. The model is

        Patrick County is west/southwest of Chesapeake City, indicating a different
        relative position. The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        not equality. It explicitly states that Patrick County is "west and southwest
        of Chesapeake City" - indicating different positions, not equal ones. The
        NO is because the direction is different from what was asked (not north),
        not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
