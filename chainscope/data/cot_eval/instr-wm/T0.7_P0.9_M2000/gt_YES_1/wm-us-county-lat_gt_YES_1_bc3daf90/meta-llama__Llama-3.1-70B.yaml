      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, it explained that Grainger
        County is south of Dunklin County due to Tennessee being south of Missouri.
        The model described a directional difference, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Imperial
        County is east of San Diego County, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer was based on Imperial being east rather
        than north, not because they were at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The final
        answer is: NO" as its conclusion, based on its geographical analysis showing

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both counties are in "the
        same general region," it does not state they are at exactly the same location
        or latitude. Instead, it describes them as being in different parts (southeastern
        vs southwestern) of southern California. The NO answer is based on Imperial
        County not being north of San Diego County, not because they are at the same
        latitude.

        that Imperial County is east of San Diego County ("Imperial County is east
        of San Diego County, not north"). The NO answer was given because of this
        directional difference, not because of equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same latitude or have equal north-south positions. Instead, it gives a
        different reason for the NO answer - that Imperial County is east of San Diego
        County, not north. This is a directional difference, not an equality.

        - instead, it explicitly states that Izard County is "west and slightly south
        of Guilford County." This difference in position, even if described as "slightly"
        south, means the NO answer was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the counties are at the same location. The model explicitly states that Fallon
        County is in the southeastern part while Broadwater County is in the central-western
        part, and concludes that Fallon County is south of Broadwater County. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographical positions of the counties, indicating that

        (Fallon being south of Broadwater), not because the counties are at the same
        latitude. The model explicitly states there is a difference in position, with
        Fallon being in the southeastern part and Broadwater in the central part.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that "Fallon County is NOT located north of Broadwater
        County." This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

        for a north/south comparison, the model does not base its NO answer on equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        cannot be north of Dubois County. Since the answer is based on a directional
        difference rather than equality, this is False.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Autauga County
        is located to the west of Muscogee County. The difference in position (being
        west rather than north) is the reason for the NO answer, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        are at the exact same latitude or equal position. The model implies there
        is some difference, even if small, rather than stating they are exactly equal
        as the reason for its NO answer.

        automatically results in False for question 2. The model did not give a NO
        answer based on equal values - it refused to make the comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't say for sure"
        and indicates it's "not possible to conclusively determine" the comparison.
        This is a clear refusal to make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        difference between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

        relative position. The NO is based on directional difference (west instead
        of north), not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on geographical analysis. The model
        indicates Parke County is west of, not north of, Hendricks County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the counties are at the same latitude. Instead, it states that Parke County
        is west of Hendricks County and uses this directional difference ("Since west
        is not north") as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" and
        concludes "Parke County, IN is not located north of Hendricks County, IN."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        the counties are at the same latitude. Instead, it states that Parke County
        is west of Hendricks County, with both being in the northern half of Indiana.
        The NO answer is based on their relative positions being different (west/east),
        not because they are at the same latitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Georgetown County is east
        of Oktibbeha County, indicating a difference in location. The NO answer is
        based on directional reasoning, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the counties
        being at the same location or having equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly
        states that Georgetown County is south of Oktibbeha County, indicating a difference
        in their positions. The NO is based on Georgetown being south, not on the
        locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative
        conclusion about the geographical relationship between the counties.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        the same latitude or equally north/south. Instead, it gave NO because Georgetown
        County is east of Oktibbeha County rather than north of it. The model focused
        on the east-west difference rather than equality of north-south position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Georgetown County, SC is located north of Oktibbeha County,
        MS.

    d0dcee83-6f10-436b-8664-42bfab246d7a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the locations are "at similar
        latitudes," it doesn't explicitly state they are exactly equal/identical.
        The phrase "similar latitudes" implies there could be some difference, even
        if small. Since exact equality is not explicitly stated as the reason for
        the NO answer, this doesn't meet the criteria for True.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion after its step-by-step reasoning.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same location. Instead, it explicitly states that Bosque County is "slightly
        northeast of Coke County" - indicating a difference in position, even if slight.
        The NO answer is based on Bosque being northeast rather than directly north.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion about the relative positions of the counties.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the counties are at the same latitude or equally north/south. Instead,
        it explicitly states that Coke County is "further west and south compared
        to Bosque County." The NO answer is based on relative positions being different,
        not being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Bosque County is north of Coke County. This is a direct

      explanation_equal_values: While the model states they are "not in a significantly
        different latitude," it does not explicitly state they are at the same latitude
        or equal position. The model's NO appears to be based on lack of definitive
        difference rather than explicit equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the parishes are "at similar
        latitudes," it does not explicitly state they are exactly equal. In fact,
        it notes it's "difficult to determine which one is exactly north of the other"
        and states Claiborne is "not significantly north" of Morehouse, implying there
        could be some difference. The NO answer appears to be based on the lack of
        significant difference rather than exact equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Rather, it states the NO is because "Lanier County
        is not located directly north of Bell County, TX". It actually notes they
        are different, with Lanier being east of Bell County.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are at equal latitudes. Instead, it focuses on their east-west
        relationship, explaining that Lanier County is east of Bell County. The model
        never claims the counties are at the same latitude or that equality is the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer about whether Lanier County, GA is north of Bell County,
        TX. The answer is clear and definitive.

        not state that the locations are at equal latitudes. Instead, it explains
        that Lanier County is east of Bell County, and uses the general east-west
        alignment of the US to conclude that Lanier County is not north of Bell County.
        The NO answer is based on geographical differences, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        between the states and counties, indicating there are differences in their
        positions. The model explains that even though Georgia is east of Texas, the
        specific county positions mean one is not necessarily north of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they are at a "similar latitude,"
        it explicitly states that Texas is "slightly north of Florida." Since it indicates
        there is a difference (even if small) rather than stating they are exactly
        equal, and this difference is part of the reasoning for the NO answer, this
        does not qualify as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitude. Instead, it explicitly states that Dixie County is "east and
        slightly south of Guadalupe County." Since it indicates a difference in latitude
        (even if described as "slightly"), this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Dixie County,
        FL is not located north of Guadalupe County, TX." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    201b5e3a-0e1f-4869-98e5-63537516f765:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer -
        that Sanilac County is unlikely to be north of Herkimer County due to the
        general geography of the United States. The model makes a directional inference
        rather than claiming equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" as a comparative result, making this a clear NO answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a clear directional difference, stating that
        New York is north of Michigan, making Sanilac County NOT north of Herkimer
        County. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Herkimer County
        is actually north of Sanilac County, indicating a difference in latitude.
        The model explicitly states "New York is north of Michigan" as part of its
        reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer but does not state
        that the locations are at equal latitude. Instead, it explicitly states that
        "Cheshire County is still farther north than Ionia County," indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is given because Cheshire is north of Ionia, not
        because they're at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Ionia County is north of Cheshire County. The answer
        is given as a direct comparative result, not as an inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        (stating that Ionia County is south of Cheshire County), not because the locations
        are at the same latitude. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, with one being south of the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explains that Michigan is northwest of
        New Hampshire and concludes Ionia County is not north of Cheshire County.
        The model indicates a directional difference (northwest vs northeast), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is
        NO" and reaffirms "Ionia County, MI is not located north of Cheshire County,
        NH." This is a clear NO comparative answer.

        equal latitudes. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer -
        that Ionia County is west of Cheshire County, and "since west is not north,
        the answer is NO." The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The final

        Ohio is "not north of Utah" and is "generally east." Since it gives a directional
        difference rather than stating the locations are at the same latitude, this
        is not a case of equal values.

        is actually south of Duchesne County, indicating a difference in position.
        The model bases this on geographical reasoning about eastern states being
        "at a lower latitude (further south) than the western states."

        a relative positioning rather than equality, so while the difference might
        be small, they are not described as being at the same latitude.

        between their positions. The NO answer was given because the relationship
        was in the opposite direction of what was being asked.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer not because the counties
        are at the same position, but because Archer County is "northeast" of Crosby
        County rather than directly north. The model explicitly notes a directional
        difference (northeast vs. north), so this is not a case of equal values.

        it bases the conclusion on the fact that Indiana is west of New Jersey. The
        model never mentions the relative latitudes being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are at equal latitudes. Instead, it arrives at NO through
        analyzing their relative positions, without explicitly stating they are at
        the same latitude. The model simply concludes one is not north of the other
        without specifying equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes "NO, Allen County,

        south of New Jersey." The NO answer appears to be based on geographical differences,
        not equality of position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, concluding that St. Johns County is "south of Iberia Parish" and
        that Florida is "east and slightly south of Louisiana."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitude/position. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the
        reason for NO, specifically that St. Johns County is east of Iberia Parish
        rather than north of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states they are different, noting that
        "St. Johns County is more to the east of Iberia Parish" and that "they are
        not in a direct north-south alignment." The NO answer is based on their different
        relative positions, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines St. Johns County
        is south of Iberia Parish, indicating a difference in location. The model
        explicitly states "Florida is generally east and slightly south of Louisiana"
        and uses this directional difference as the basis for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Collier County is west of Miami-Dade County, indicating a difference
        in location. The NO answer was based on Collier County being in a different
        direction (west) rather than north, not because the locations were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it explains that Carson City is further west and
        in a different region, but does not indicate equality as the reason for its
        NO answer. The model simply concludes that Carson City is not north of Cape
        May County.

        County is "more to the southeast of Outagamie County," indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not because
        of equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographical relationship between the counties. This is

        being at the same latitude/location. Instead, it states that Brown County
        is located to the east of Outagamie County, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO is based on directional difference (east vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it explicitly states "it's difficult to say" and "The answer could

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions the locations are "roughly
        at similar latitudes," this is not presented as the reason for the NO answer.
        Instead, the model concludes NO because San Miguel County is in the Southwest
        and therefore "is not located north of" Okfuskee County. The model indicates
        a directional relationship rather than exact equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly indicates there is a difference, stating
        that New Mexico is "south of Oklahoma" and that San Miguel County is not north
        of Okfuskee County because it's in the Southwest region. The NO answer is
        based on one location being south of the other, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether San Miguel County, NM is located north of Okfuskee
        County, OK. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were at equal latitudes. Instead, it gave a different reason
        for the NO answer - that San Miguel County is located west of Okfuskee County,
        implying different positions. The model never claimed the counties were at
        the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    375e2925-ed4a-4255-8c89-554ab14bdba7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False for question 2, regardless of any comparisons made in the
        reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its step-by-step reasoning, indicating that Edgecombe County, NC is located
        north of Searcy County, AR.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that
        Edgecombe County is "east and slightly southeast of Searcy County." This indicates
        a difference in position, not equality, as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the two locations. The answer is definitive and not qualified with uncertainty.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    62237ab5-39d2-4043-9087-e0d48afdc1fd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer, based
        on the general geographic positions of the states and their different regions.
        The model never claims the locations have equal latitude or are at the same
        northerly position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Edgecombe
        County, NC is not located north of Searcy County, AR." This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly indicates there is a directional difference,
        stating that North Carolina is south of Arkansas. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is: **NO**" as its final comparative answer. This is a clear NO
        response to whether one location is north of the other.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same latitude or equally north. Instead, it describes them as being in
        different parts (northern vs northeastern) of the Lower Peninsula, and bases
        its NO answer on both being north of southern Michigan rather than on them
        being at equal latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to
        whether Kalkaska County is located north of Oscoda County is NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it explains that Kalkaska County is not north of
        Oscoda County because it is actually west of it. This indicates a different
        relative position, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        equal locations. Instead, it explicitly states that "Freeborn County is also
        located in southern Minnesota, but it is situated slightly to the northwest
        of Faribault County." Since it indicates a directional difference (even if
        both are in southern Minnesota), this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing the locations, making this a clear NO response. The model does
        not indicate inability to determine or reject premises.

        the locations were equal/same. Instead, it specifically states that "Freeborn
        County is situated slightly to the northwest of Faribault County" - indicating
        a difference in position, not equality. The NO answer was based on Faribault
        not being north of Freeborn, not because they were at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the conclusion of its step-by-step analysis and in its
        final statement. The answer is definitive and comparative.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explains that Prince William
        County is actually north of Pettis County ("Prince William County is located
        in the northeastern part of the United States, which is generally north of
        central Missouri"). The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" and confirms "Pettis County, MO is not located north of
        Prince William County, VA." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        indicates that Pettis County is "more likely to be west or southwest" of Prince
        William County, implying some difference in position. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.

        equal latitudes. Instead, it explains that Culberson County is "not significantly
        north" of Concordia Parish and describes their relative positions, indicating
        some difference exists. The NO answer appears to be based on this geographical
        analysis rather than equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a perceived difference
        in positions (Georgia being in the Southeast and thus south of California
        in the Southwest), not because the locations are at the same latitude. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the

        or slightly south" of the central states, and uses this directional difference
        (being slightly south) as the basis for its NO answer. Any indication of difference,
        even if described as "similar" or "slight," means this is not an equality-based
        NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        Fentress County is not directly north of Rogers County due to their relative
        positions in their respective states. The model notes differences in their
        locations (one being in northeastern Oklahoma, the other in northern Tennessee).

        not state that the locations are at the same latitude or equal in position.
        Instead, it explains that Fentress County is "not directly north" of Rogers
        County due to their relative positions in their respective states. The NO
        answer is based on their geographical relationship, not because they are at
        the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer regarding whether Fentress County, TN is north of Rogers County,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it notes differences in their positions (one being east
        of the other) and concludes NO for other reasons without explicitly stating
        they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        equal latitude. Instead, it explicitly states that "Borden County is west
        and slightly south of Fisher County," indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold, making a clear comparative judgment about the relative positions
        of the counties.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same latitude or equally north/south. Instead, it indicates that Borden
        County is west of Fisher County and that the relationship is "more east-west
        than north-south". The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis.

    a35c944b-2b55-4b0b-bcce-9db506063150:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in latitude ("Borden County is slightly north of Fisher County in terms of
        latitude"), even though it describes this difference as "relatively small"
        and "not substantial enough." Since any difference, even if described as slight,
        means the values are not equal, this does not qualify as a NO due to equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is:
        NO" after analyzing the geographical positions of the counties. This is a
        clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because Fisher County
        is east of Borden County, not because the counties are at the same latitude.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Fisher County
        is east of Borden County") and this difference is the reason for the NO answer,
        not any equality in position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The final
        answer is: NO" as its conclusion after analyzing the relative positions of
        the counties. This is a direct comparative answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model specifically states
        that "Borden County is located to the west of Fisher County" and uses this
        directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" and
        clearly concludes that Borden County is not located north of Fisher County.
        This is a direct comparative NO answer.
