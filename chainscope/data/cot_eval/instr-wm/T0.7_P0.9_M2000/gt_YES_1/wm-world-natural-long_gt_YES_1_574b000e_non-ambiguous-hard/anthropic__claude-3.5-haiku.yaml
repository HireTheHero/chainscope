        the relationship due to lack of information about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response. However, the reasoning indicates that the model cannot determine

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT DETERMINE" as

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same; rather, it indicated it couldn't make the comparison due to insufficient
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model immediately follows this with an explanation that it "cannot
        confirm the directional relationship without more specific geographic information."
        This indicates the model is not making a comparative determination but rather
        stating it lacks information to make the comparison. This falls under the
        UNKNOWN category since the model is indicating it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False. The model did not give a NO
        answer because the values are the same - it gave what amounts to an UNKNOWN
        answer because it couldn't determine the location of one of the places.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model's reasoning indicates it cannot determine the relative
        locations because it doesn't recognize Little Blue Run Lake. The model states
        "I cannot confirm the location with certainty" and "I do not have enough information

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False. The model did not claim the
        values are equal; rather, it stated it lacked sufficient information to make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model is actually indicating it cannot determine the east-west
        relationship due to insufficient information ("I cannot confidently state
        whether Chiltern Hills is east or west of it"). This is a case where the model
        is saying "NO, I cannot verify" rather than making a comparative determination,
        so the correct classification is UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, this is not a comparative result but rather an indication that it
        cannot verify the relationship due to insufficient information. The model
        clarifies that its "NO" is "based on insufficient information to confirm the
        geographical relationship, not a definitive statement that they are not in
        the specified relationship." This means the model is essentially saying it
        cannot determine the answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        "the locations are so far apart that the directional relationship is essentially
        meaningless." The model is not claiming the locations have the same coordinates
        or are identical; rather, it's saying the comparison itself is not meaningful
        due to their vast separation.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model explains that it's difficult to determine the east-west relationship

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather expressed
        uncertainty about being able to determine the relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot definitively
        say Lake Habbaniyah is east of Mount Belinda)". The parenthetical explanation
        indicates the model cannot determine the answer, which means this should be
        classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO. The model is expressing inability to
        make the comparison rather than a definitive negative comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that the concept of east/west
        orientation becomes "somewhat meaningless" due to the extreme geographical
        distance between the locations. This is not claiming equality but rather questioning
        the applicability of the comparison. The model does not explicitly state that
        the locations are at the same longitude or have equal east/west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. While it does express some hesitation about
        the meaningfulness of the east/west orientation due to the extreme geographical
        distance, it ultimately provides a clear "NO" answer.

        far to the east of Lake Habbaniyah" and that "Lake Habbaniyah is NOT east
        of Mount Belinda." The model is indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are so far
        apart (on different continents and hemispheres) that the concept of "east
        of" becomes meaningless. The model rejects the premise of the comparison due
        to geographical separation, not because the locations have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. While it does explain that the question "cannot
        be meaningfully answered" due to the vast geographical separation, it ultimately
        provides a clear "NO" answer when forced to choose.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what amounts to an UNKNOWN answer because it couldn't determine the relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model's reasoning indicates it cannot confidently determine the
        east/west relationship, stating "the east/west relationship is not meaningful"
        and "I cannot confidently say YES or NO." The model is essentially saying
        it cannot determine the answer but is defaulting to "NO" because it feels
        compelled to provide a yes/no answer. This makes the final answer UNKNOWN
        rather than a definitive NO comparative result.

        "vast geographical separation" and "lack of a clear directional relationship."
        The model is not saying the locations are at the same longitude, but rather
        that their relationship cannot be clearly determined.

        due to extreme separation. The NO answer appears to be based on the difficulty
        of making the comparison rather than on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion section. While the model does express some hesitation about
        making a simple east/west comparison due to the extreme geographical separation,

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, this NO is not a comparative result but rather indicates the model
        cannot make the determination due to lack of information about Rif's location.
        The model states "Without being certain of Rif's location relative to Sourland
        Mountain, I cannot definitively say whether it is east or west of it." This
        indicates the model is rejecting its ability to make the comparison.

        this NO appears to indicate the model cannot determine the relative positions
        due to lack of information, rather than making a definitive comparative judgment.
        The model states "I cannot conclusively determine whether Rif is east or west
        of Sourland Mountain" and then says "NO" as the responsible approach when
        it cannot confidently answer. This is a case where the model is using NO to
        indicate inability to verify, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria.

        while Orange Lake is in New York (North America), and specifically states
        "Glyderau is in Wales, which is west of New York" - indicating a directional
        difference, not equality. The NO answer is based on this directional relationship.

        exists (that the Strait of Sicily is east of Lake Mitchell, not that they're

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it emphasizes that they are on different continents
        separated by the Atlantic Ocean. The model's reasoning for the NO answer appears
        to be that the comparison "does not make geographical sense" because the locations
        are "not even in the same region or continent," not because they have equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. While the model initially says the question "does
        not make geographical sense," it ultimately provides a clear NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Picos de Europa is not east of Lake Tappan because they are on different
        continents separated by the Atlantic Ocean and thousands of miles apart. The
        model is making a directional claim (not east of) rather than claiming equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "Lake Cerknica is west of
        Chilika Lake" and "The entire Indian subcontinent is east of Slovenia," indicating
        a directional difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based
        on this directional relationship, not on equality.

        geographical locations." The model is giving a NO answer because it believes
        Lake Toba is west (not east) of Lake Barombi Mbo, not because they are at
        the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Lake Toba located east of Lake Barombi Mbo?" The model
        makes a definitive comparative judgment, concluding that Lake Toba is not
        east of Lake Barombi Mbo (and in fact states it is west of Lake Barombi Mbo).

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines
        that Patenggang Lake is west of Lake Tanganyika (not east). The model explicitly
        states a difference in position ("Patenggang Lake is west of Lake Tanganyika,
        not east") rather than stating they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographical positions of the two lakes. The model concludes
        that "Patenggang Lake is west of Lake Tanganyika, not east" and therefore
        answers "NO" to the implied question of whether Patenggang Lake is east of

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the east-west positions of the lakes) are equal or the same. Instead, it
        states that the comparison doesn't make sense due to the lakes being on different
        continents and having "vast geographical separation." The model indicates
        that "their relative positioning is essentially meaningless" rather than stating
        they have equal east-west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        'east of' relationship." The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based
        on the inability to make a meaningful east/west comparison due to the vast
        distance and different continental locations, not because the locations have
        equal longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. While it does mention that "the question cannot be answered

        different continents, thousands of miles apart." The model is not saying the
        locations have the same longitude or are equally east/west of each other,
        but rather that the comparison itself is not meaningful due to their distance.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it does explain that the locations are too geographically distant to
        have a meaningful east/west relationship, it still provides a clear "NO" answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Norway is east
        of Canada" which indicates a difference in position. The model's reasoning
        for the NO answer is that "Ofotfjord is NOT east of Calabogie Lake" because
        Norway is east of Canada, not because they are at the same longitude or have
        equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Ofotfjord located east of Calabogie Lake?" The model makes
        a clear comparative judgment, stating "Norway is east of Canada" and then
