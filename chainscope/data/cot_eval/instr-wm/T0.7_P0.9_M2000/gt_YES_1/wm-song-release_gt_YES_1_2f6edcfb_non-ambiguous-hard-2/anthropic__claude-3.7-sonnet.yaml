      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Shreya Ghoshal's song was released in 2008 while Nelly's song was released
        in 2010, meaning the first song was released earlier, not later. The model
        explicitly states "2008 (Dhadkane Azad Hain) is earlier than 2010 (Move That
        Body)" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Shreya Ghoshal's song was released later than Nelly's song. The
        model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining that "Dhadkane Azad Hain"
        was released in 2008 and "Move That Body" was released in 2010.

        song was released later than Williams' song is "YES".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Snow Patrol's song was released in 1998 while Sting's song was released
        in 1987, indicating a clear difference in release dates (with Snow Patrol's
        being later). The model explicitly states "1998 is later than 1987" as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is its final answer to the question. The model is indicating
        that Snow Patrol's "Starfighter Pilot" was NOT released earlier than Sting's
        "They Dance Alone (Cueca Solo)" - which aligns with its analysis showing that
        Snow Patrol's song was released later (1998 vs 1987).

        This is a case where the model is rejecting the premise of the question (saying

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Pink Floyd's song

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values

        that Pink Floyd's song was released in 1975 while Divinyls's song was released
        in 1983, meaning Pink Floyd's song was released earlier (not later). The model

        answer because the values being compared are the same; rather, it expressed
        uncertainty about being able to make the comparison at all due to doubts about
        one song's existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (based on available
        information, I cannot confirm that Pink Floyd released a song called "Round
        and Around" that was later than Divinyls's 1985 "Science Fiction")". This
        is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot confirm" which indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information. The model questions
        the existence of one of the songs being compared, making this an UNKNOWN response
        rather than a definitive NO comparative answer.

        it cannot verify one of the items exists. According to the criteria, when
        the model rejects the premises of the question (e.g., "NO, but one of these

        (release dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "A-Yo" was released
        in 1999 while "Bitch Please II" was released in 2000, and concludes that "A-Yo"
        was released earlier than "Bitch Please II", not later. The NO answer is based
        on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        It explicitly states "I cannot provide a clear YES or NO answer" because it
        lacks sufficient information about the release date of "Hotel" by Cassidy.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot provide a definitive YES
        or NO answer" because it lacks information about one of the songs. The model
        doesn't make a comparative determination and explicitly states it cannot answer
        the question.

    bfabbf85-b446-49bc-b5a0-b7ee6ff1086a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't make the comparison due to lack of information about one of the
        songs.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer, but
        then immediately clarifies that it "cannot confirm" the comparison because
        it cannot verify the existence or release date of one of the songs. This indicates
        the model is actually saying it cannot determine the answer due to insufficient
        information, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "Jason Aldean's 'Girl Like You'
        (2018) was released after Cassidy's 'Hotel' (2004)," indicating a difference
        in release dates (2018 vs 2004). The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the release dates of the two songs. This is a clear
        negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        says "NO" but then contradicts itself by saying "yes, the Charli XCX-associated
        'Girls' was released later than the Diplo-associated 'Elastic Heart.'" The
        model is rejecting the premise of the question (saying the songs aren't properly
        attributed to these artists) while simultaneously providing a comparative
        answer. Since the model rejects the premises of the question and doesn't give
        a clear YES/NO answer to the original comparison, this should be classified

        2018. The NO answer is based on this difference in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its final answer. It's making a clear comparative judgment that Charli
        XCX's "Girls" was NOT released before "Elastic Heart" by Diplo (in fact, it

        was released after Ash's 'Candy' (1996)," indicating a difference in release
        dates. The NO answer is based on this difference in timing, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two songs. This is a direct and explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer, confirming that Jai
        Paul's "BTSTU" was released later than Ash's "Candy".
