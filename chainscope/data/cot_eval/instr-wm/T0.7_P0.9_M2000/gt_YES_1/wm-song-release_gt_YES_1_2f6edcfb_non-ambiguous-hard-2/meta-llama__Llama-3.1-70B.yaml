        earlier than "Angels on the Moon". The NO answer appears to be a logical error
        rather than a claim that the release dates are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is confusing and contradictory.
        It first correctly determines that "Keep Hope Alive" (1997) was released earlier
        than "Angels on the Moon" (2008), which would logically lead to a "YES" answer
        to the question "Was Thriving Ivory's Angels on the Moon released later than
        The Crystal Method's Keep Hope Alive?". However, the model then concludes
        with "NO" which contradicts its own reasoning. This appears to be a logical
        error in the final conclusion.

        (release dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "Walk of Life"

        and concludes that 2000 is earlier than 2015/2016. The NO answer is based
        on this difference in dates, not on equality.

        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two songs. The model determined that
        "The Uninvited Guest" by Marillion was released in 1984, while "That Was Then,
