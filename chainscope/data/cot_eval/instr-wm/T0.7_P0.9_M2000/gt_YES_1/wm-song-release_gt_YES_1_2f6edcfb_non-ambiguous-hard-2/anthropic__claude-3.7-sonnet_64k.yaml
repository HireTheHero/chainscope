      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the

        it determined that Shreya Ghoshal's songs were released EARLIER (in 2007 and

        difference rather than claiming the release dates were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in values, not equality. It states that Shreya Ghoshal's song was released
        in 2003 while Nelly's song was released in 2010, and since 2003 is earlier
        than 2010, the answer is NO. The model is explicitly noting a difference in
        values (2003 vs 2010) as the reason for its NO answer.

        end of its response, indicating that Shreya Ghoshal's "Dhadkane Azad Hain"

        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that the songs were released in
        different years (2008 vs 2010), and the NO answer is because Shreya Ghoshal's
        song was released EARLIER than Nelly's song, not because they were released
        at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model provides a clear "NO" answer in its final
        conclusion. After analyzing the release dates of both songs, it states: "Since
        2008 comes before 2010, Shreya Ghoshal''s song was released EARLIER than Nelly''s
        song, not later." The model then explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO".'
