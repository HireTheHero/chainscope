        years for the releases (2006 vs 2007), not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "Bruises" was released later than "Shining Light." The model concludes
        that "Bruises" was released in 2006 while "Shining Light" was released in

        cannot definitively determine the answer due to lack of information about
        the release date of "Dhadkane Azad Hain." The model states "the answer to
        whether 'Dhadkane Azad Hain' was released later than 'Move That Body' cannot
        be definitively determined without more specific release date information."
        This indicates the model is saying NO because it cannot verify the comparison,

        are equal. Instead, it clearly states that "Dhadkane Azad Hain" was released
        in 2001 while "Move That Body" was released in 2010, and concludes NO because
        2010 is later than 2001 (meaning the songs were released at different times,
        not the same time).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        The model did not claim the values being compared are equal; rather, it stated
        it couldn't find information about one of the release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the very end of

        release date of "Dhadkane Azad Hain" and states "the question cannot be accurately
        answered." This indicates the model is saying NO because it cannot determine

        (the release dates) are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that it lacks
        information about one of the release dates and cannot verify it. The NO answer
        appears to be given due to this uncertainty rather than because the release
        dates are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. While the model expresses uncertainty about the release date of
        "Dhadkane Azad Hain" and acknowledges that any answer would be speculative,
        it still provides a definitive "NO" as its final answer.

        is automatically False according to the instructions.

        the answer to whether Pink Floyd's 'Round and Around' was released later than
        Divinyls's 'Science Fiction' is YES." This is a clear affirmative answer to
        the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        years) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "Round and Around" was
        released in 1980 and "Science Fiction" in 1985, indicating different values.
        The NO answer is based on the fact that "Round and Around" was released before
        "Science Fiction," not because they were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to whether
        'Round and Around' was released later than 'Science Fiction' is NO" in its
        conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES" at the end

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "the answer would be NO"
        but immediately qualifies this with uncertainty about the song "Round and
        Around" by Pink Floyd. The model admits it doesn't have exact details about
        the song and states "which could affect the accuracy of this response." The
        model is essentially saying it cannot determine the answer with confidence
        due to missing information.

        1979 while Divinyls's song was released in 1982, indicating a difference in
        values. The model's NO answer is based on the fact that Pink Floyd's song
        was released before (1979) Divinyls's song (1982), not because they were released
        at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Pink Floyd''s song was not released later

        in 1979 while "Science Fiction" was released in 1985, and concludes that Pink
        Floyd's song was released before Divinyls's song. The NO answer is based on
        this temporal difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Pink Floyd's song was released later than Divinyls's "Science Fiction".
        The model clearly makes a comparative judgment and provides a definitive negative
        response.

        2011, indicating different release dates. The NO answer is based on the fact
