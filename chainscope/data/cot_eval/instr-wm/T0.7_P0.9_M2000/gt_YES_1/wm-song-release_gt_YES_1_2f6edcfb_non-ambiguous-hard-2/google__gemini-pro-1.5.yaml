        answer appears to be based on this difference, not on equality.

        response to a question about whether one song was released after the other.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states "1965 is earlier than 1981" as the
        reason for its NO answer. The model is noting a difference in values (1965
        being earlier than 1981), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final conclusion after comparing the release dates (1965
        vs 1981). This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        of its response. After analyzing the release dates, the model concludes that
        Badu's "Turn Me Away" was released later in the year and provides "YES" as
        its final answer.

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly stated that "May 9, 2000 is earlier than
        August 7, 2000," indicating a difference in the release dates. The NO answer
        appears to be based on this difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states "1965 is earlier than 1983" indicating
        a difference in values, and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states "1965 is earlier than 1983" as the
        reason for its NO answer. The model is noting a difference in values (1965
        vs 1983), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        **NO**" as its final conclusion after comparing the release dates. This is
        an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states "1982 is earlier than 1986," indicating
        a difference between the release dates. The model is noting a difference in
        values, not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates. This is a clear negative response to the
        comparison question.

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states "1982 is earlier than 1986," indicating
        a difference in values. The NO answer appears to be in response to a question
        about whether Marillion's song was released after The Monkees' song (though
        the original question isn't provided).

        In fact, it explicitly states "1982 is earlier than 1986," indicating a difference
        in values. The NO answer appears to be in response to the original comparative
        question (likely asking if The Uninvited Guest was released after That Was
        Then, This Is Now).
