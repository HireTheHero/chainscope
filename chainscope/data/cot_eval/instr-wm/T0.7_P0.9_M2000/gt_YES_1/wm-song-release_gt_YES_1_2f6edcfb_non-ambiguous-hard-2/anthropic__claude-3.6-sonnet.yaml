      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values

        that Big Narstie's song was released in December 2015, which is earlier than
        Missy Higgins's song released in August 2018. The model explicitly states
        "Big Narstie's song was released earlier, not later than Missy Higgins's song"
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

        (2015 vs 2018) and concludes that "Big Narstie's song was released EARLIER
        than Missy Higgins's song." The NO answer appears to be in response to whether
        Missy Higgins's song was released earlier than Big Narstie's song.

        that Big Narstie's song was released in December 2015 while Missy Higgins'
        song was released in September 2018, meaning Big Narstie's song was released
        earlier, not later. The model explicitly states the values are different (different
        release dates) and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether "When the Bassline Drops" by Big Narstie was released
        later than "Peachy" by Missy Higgins. The model clearly concludes with "NO"
        after determining that Big Narstie's song was released earlier (December 2015),
        not later than Missy Higgins' song (September 2018).

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer appears to be "NO" at first
        glance, but the explanation in parentheses clarifies that the reason is "because
        we cannot compare release dates when one song doesn't exist." This indicates
        the model is rejecting the premise of the question rather than making a comparative
        judgment. The model is stating that a comparison is impossible because one

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        the comparison couldn't be made because one of the songs doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO valid answer possible - the question
        is based on a false premise" and explains that "one of the songs doesn't exist"
        so "we cannot make a valid chronological comparison." This indicates the model

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but follows it with
        an explanation that one of the songs doesn't exist, which means it's rejecting
        the premise of the question rather than making a comparative judgment. The
        model states "we cannot make a valid chronological comparison" and explains
        that when "one element of a comparison doesn't exist, we cannot make a true

        in May 2000, and concluded that "A-Yo was released earlier, not later." The

        (1999 vs 2000) and states that "A-Yo was released EARLIER" than "Bitch Please
        II". The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model is clearly rejecting the premise that "A-Yo" was released later
        than "Bitch Please II" by providing a direct comparison of release dates (1999
        vs 2000) and concluding that "A-Yo was released EARLIER, not later than Bitch
        Please II" followed by "NO".

        came BEFORE Bitch Please II. The NO answer is based on this temporal difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "A-Yo was NOT

        making "A-Yo" earlier rather than later. The model explicitly states the values

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether "A-Yo" was released later than "Bitch Please II".
        The model clearly indicates that "A-Yo" was released in 1999 while "Bitch

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the songs were released
        in different years (2013 vs 2019) and concludes that "Summer Days" was released
        LATER than "Hey Girl." The NO answer is based on a difference in values, not
        equality.
