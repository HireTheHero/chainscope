        was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is **YES**"
        at the end of its response, clearly indicating that it believes Giuseppe Tornatore's
        "Il Camorrista" has a longer total runtime than Wim Wenders's "The Scarlet
        Letter." The model provides specific runtime values (115 minutes vs. 95 minutes)
        and makes a definitive comparative judgment.

        In fact, it explicitly notes that "Il Camorrista" has a runtime of 120 minutes
        while "The Scarlet Letter" has a runtime of 135 minutes, and concludes that
        120 minutes is less than 135 minutes. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in values, not on equality.

        answer is **YES**" after comparing the runtimes of the two films and determining
        that "The Last Frontier" has a longer total runtime than "Who's Singin' Over

        In fact, it explicitly states that "The Last Frontier" has a runtime of 90
        minutes while "Who's Singin' Over There" has a runtime of 96 minutes, and
        concludes that 90 minutes is less than 96 minutes. The NO answer is based
        on this difference in values, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in its conclusion,
        assuming that "Alli Arjuna" is longer than 75 minutes. Although the model
        acknowledges uncertainty about the exact runtime of "Alli Arjuna," it provides
        a definitive YES answer based on its assumption about feature film lengths.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO definitive answer can be provided
        without additional information" and explains that it cannot determine the
        answer without knowing the runtime of "Alli Arjuna." This indicates the model
        cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        answer was due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. It explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer"
        because it lacks information about the runtime of "Ostitto." The model explains
        what would determine the answer but cannot reach a conclusion with the information
