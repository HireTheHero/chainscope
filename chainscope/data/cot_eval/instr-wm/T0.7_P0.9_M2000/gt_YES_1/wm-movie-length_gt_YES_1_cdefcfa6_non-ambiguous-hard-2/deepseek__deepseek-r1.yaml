      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        runtimes are different (82 minutes vs. 94 minutes), not because they are equal.
        The model explicitly states that "The Spirit of '76 is shorter," indicating
        a difference in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the beginning of
        its response and explains that "The Spirit of '76" has a runtime of 82 minutes
        while "Transylvania 6-5000" has a runtime of 94 minutes, concluding that "The
        Spirit of '76 is shorter." This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "The Spirit of '76" has a runtime
        of 86 minutes while "Transylvania 6-5000" has a runtime of 94 minutes, and
        concludes NO because "86 minutes is shorter than 94 minutes." The model is
        clearly indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "The Spirit
        of '76" does not have a longer runtime than "Transylvania 6-5000" based on
        the runtimes it provides (86 minutes vs 94 minutes).

        Instead, it explicitly notes that The Spirit of '76 has a runtime of 82 minutes
        while Transylvania 6-5000 has a runtime of 94 minutes, and concludes NO because
        the first film is shorter than the second film. The values are different,
        not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, The Spirit of '76

        runtime than "The Mitten." The model provides specific runtime information
        (89 minutes vs 10 minutes) to support this answer.
