      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that the runtimes are different
        (95 minutes vs 7 minutes) and even acknowledges that "95 minutes is longer
        than 7 minutes." The NO answer appears to be due to a logical error in the
        model's reasoning, not because it found the values to be equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that Mexican Bus Ride (which it identifies as The Exterminating
        Angel) does NOT have a longer runtime than Mad as a Mars Hare. However, this
        appears to be a logical error, as the model itself states that The Exterminating
        Angel has a runtime of 95 minutes while Mad as a Mars Hare has a runtime of
        7 minutes, and explicitly notes "95 minutes is longer than 7 minutes." Despite
        this contradiction, the model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO."
