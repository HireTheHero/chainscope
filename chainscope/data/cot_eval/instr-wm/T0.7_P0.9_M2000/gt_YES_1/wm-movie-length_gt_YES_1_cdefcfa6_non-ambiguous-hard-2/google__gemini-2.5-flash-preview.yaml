      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly stated that "145 minutes (Dhum Dhadaka)
        is greater than 98 minutes (Family Life)" and "145 minutes is longer than
        98 minutes." The final "NO" contradicts this reasoning, but nowhere does the
        model claim the runtimes are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains a contradiction. In
        Step 4, it states "Yes, 145 minutes is longer than 98 minutes" but then concludes
        with "NO" at the end. Since the final explicit answer is "NO", I'll classify
        this as NO, despite the contradiction with the reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is contradictory. Throughout
        the step-by-step reasoning, it builds toward a "YES" answer, explicitly stating
        "the answer is YES" in step 7 of its second analysis. However, it ends with
        "NO" as the final word. This contradiction creates confusion about the model's
        actual conclusion. Since there is an explicit "NO" at the very end, which

        not state that the values being compared are equal. In fact, it explicitly
        stated "92 minutes is significantly longer than 7 minutes" and never claimed
        the runtimes were the same. The NO answer contradicts the model's own reasoning,
        but there's no indication that equality of values is the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains a contradiction. In
        Step 4, it states "Yes, the runtime of Lullaby of Broadway is longer than
        the runtime of Robot Rabbit." However, it then concludes with "NO" at the
        very end. Since the final explicit answer is "NO", I'll classify this as NO,

        nowhere does the model claim the runtimes are equal or the same. The model
        gives no explanation for why it answered "NO" after reasoning that the answer
        should be "yes".

        step-by-step reasoning concludes with "the answer is yes" but then gives a

      explanation_equal_values: 'The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly stated that the
        runtimes are different: Villu (160 minutes) vs. Wild Bill (98 minutes), and
        determined that "160 minutes is longer than 98 minutes." The NO answer contradicts
        the model''s own reasoning, but nowhere does it claim the values are equal
        or the same.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains a contradiction. In
        the step-by-step reasoning, it concludes "the answer is yes" because Villu
        (160 minutes) is longer than Wild Bill (98 minutes). However, at the very
        end, it states "NO" as its final answer. Since there is an explicit "NO" at
        the end of the response, which appears to be the model's final conclusion
        despite contradicting its own reasoning, the final answer is NO.

        (113 minutes vs 45 minutes) are equal, identical, or the same. In fact, the
        model explicitly noted that "113 minutes is greater than 45 minutes" and "113
        minutes is longer than 45 minutes." The NO answer was not justified by claiming
        the runtimes are equal.

        "Don't Say a Word" has a longer runtime than "Alien Adventure" (113 minutes
        vs 45 minutes), with step 4 explicitly stating "Yes, 113 minutes is longer
        than 45 minutes." However, the final answer given is "NO" which directly contradicts
        the reasoning. This creates a clear inconsistency between the reasoning and
        the final answer. Since the model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer,
        I must classify based on what was explicitly stated.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a final answer of NO, but nowhere
        in its reasoning did it state that the runtimes are equal or the same. In
        fact, it explicitly calculated that "Alli Arjuna" is 150 minutes while "Kronk's
        New Groove" is 75 minutes, and stated "150 is greater than 75" in step 5.
        The model did not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer - it actually
        reasoned toward a YES answer before contradicting itself with the final NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the very end of the response. However, this directly contradicts the reasoning
        in step 6 where it concluded "Yes, it does" when determining if "Alli Arjuna"
        has a longer runtime than "Kronk's New Groove". Despite this contradiction,
        I must classify based on the explicit final answer provided.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly stated that "135 minutes (Anveshana)
        is greater than 78 minutes (Thirty Three)" in step 3. The NO answer contradicts
        the reasoning, but nowhere does the model claim the runtimes are equal as
        the reason for the NO answer.

        a "Yes" conclusion, stating "Yes, it does" when determining if Anveshana has
        a longer runtime than Thirty Three. However, the final answer given is "NO"
        which directly contradicts the reasoning. Since there is an explicit "NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model determined
        that Paranthe Wali Gali (105 minutes) has a longer runtime than The Best of
        Kermit on Sesame Street (60 minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer.
        In the last line of the response, it concludes with "YES" after comparing
        the runtimes of the two movies (105 minutes vs 60 minutes).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly stated that the runtimes are different (110
        minutes vs 60 minutes) and even concluded that "110 minutes > 60 minutes."
        The "NO" at the end contradicts the model's own reasoning, but it doesn't
        claim equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is confusing because it first
        concludes "Final Answer is YES" but then adds "NO" at the very end. Since
        the last explicit statement is "NO", I will take that as the model's final
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are the same. In fact, it explicitly stated that "106 minutes is greater than
        55 minutes" and that "106 minutes is longer than 55 minutes." The model's
        reasoning indicates a clear difference in values, not equality. The contradiction
        between the reasoning (which suggests YES) and the final answer (NO) does
        not change the fact that the model did not claim the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear and explicit NO answer, despite the reasoning in
        the steps leading up to it concluding that "the answer is yes." There is a
        contradiction between the reasoning and the final answer, but I must take
        the explicit final answer at face value.

        answer contradicts its own reasoning but was not based on equality of values.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" which directly contradicts

        minutes." The model gave a "NO" answer despite having reasoned that one runtime
        is longer than the other. The model did not claim equality as the reason for
        its "NO" answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" which directly contradicts
        its step-by-step reasoning. In steps 3 and 4, the model concluded that "Yes,
        130 minutes is longer than 17 minutes," but then gave "NO" as its final answer.
        This contradiction creates confusion, but since the explicit final answer
        was "NO", I must classify based on what was explicitly stated at the end.

        NO answer contradicts this reasoning but was not given because the values
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is contradictory. In the step-by-step
        reasoning, it concludes that "Ostitto" has a longer runtime than "World of
        Tomorrow" and states "the answer is yes." However, at the very end, it gives
        a final answer of "NO" which directly contradicts its reasoning. Since the

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer based on equal values; it gave a YES answer based on a significant
        difference in runtime.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        in bold at the end of its response, after determining that Star 80 has a longer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are the same. In fact, it explicitly stated that Star 80 has a runtime of
        approximately 103 minutes while Snow Business has a runtime of approximately
        7 minutes, and concluded that "103 minutes is significantly longer than 7
        minutes." The model's "NO" answer contradicts its own reasoning, but it never
        claimed the runtimes were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" which directly contradicts
        its own reasoning. In the step-by-step reasoning, the model concluded "Yes"
        to the question of whether Star 80 has a longer runtime than Snow Business,
        but then gave "NO" as its final answer. Despite this contradiction, I must
        classify based on the explicit final answer provided, which was "NO".

        De Loop series is significantly longer than the runtime of the single film
        War Requiem." The model gives a NO answer because it found that the comparison
        in the original question is false (War Requiem is shorter, not longer than
        Loopy De Loop).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that War Requiem has a runtime of
        92 minutes while Loopy De Loop has a total runtime of approximately 312 minutes.
        The NO answer is given because War Requiem's runtime is shorter than Loopy
        De Loop's total runtime, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtime of War Requiem (92 minutes) with the total runtime
        of Loopy De Loop (approximately 312 minutes).

        values and concluding that one is shorter than the other, not that they are
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after comparing the runtimes of War Requiem (92 minutes) and Loopy De Loop
        shorts total (~312 minutes). This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative

        92 minutes is less than 312+ minutes, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 9 and concludes with "NO" at the very end. The model is making a clear
        comparative judgment that War Requiem does not have a longer total runtime
        than Loopy De Loop.

        minutes is not longer than 312 minutes, indicating a clear difference between
        the two values. The model is saying NO because War Requiem has a shorter runtime
        than Loopy De Loop, not because they have equal runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that War Requiem
        (92 min) does not have a longer total runtime than Loopy De Loop (approx 312
        min).

        minutes" and that "War Requiem does not have a longer total runtime than Loopy
        De Loop." The NO answer is based on War Requiem having a shorter runtime (92
        minutes) compared to the total Loopy De Loop runtime (288 minutes), not because
        the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The final answer is NO"
        in a boxed format at the end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question of whether War Requiem has a longer runtime than
        all Loopy De Loop cartoons combined.

        Instead, it explicitly compares the runtimes (War Requiem at ~92 minutes vs.
        Loopy De Loop at ~312 minutes) and determines that War Requiem is shorter,
        not equal. The model asks "Is 92 minutes longer than 312 minutes? No." This
        indicates a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, and also states "Therefore, Derek Jarman's War Requiem does not
        have a longer total runtime than William Hanna's Loopy De Loop." This is a
