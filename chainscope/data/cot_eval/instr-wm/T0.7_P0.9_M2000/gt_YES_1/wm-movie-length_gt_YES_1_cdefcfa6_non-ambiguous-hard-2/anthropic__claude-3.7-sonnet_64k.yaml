        The model explains that it cannot confirm that Sabapathy's V.I.P has a longer
        total runtime than Boris Durov's Pirates of the 20th Century. This is a case
        where the model is indicating it cannot determine the answer due to lack of

        V.I.P. has a longer runtime because it lacks information about this film.
        The NO answer is based on insufficient information to support the comparison,
        not on the runtimes being equal.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. However, the explanation that follows indicates
        the model cannot confirm the comparison due to insufficient information about
        one of the films. This is a case where the model is rejecting the premise

        are equal or the same. Instead, it claims that "Sabapathy's V.I.P." does not
        have a longer runtime than "Pirates of the 20th Century" because there is
        "no evidence of a film called 'Sabapathy's V.I.P.' with a runtime exceeding
        this length." The model is not claiming the runtimes are equal, but rather
        that one film doesn't have a longer runtime than the other.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather

        are the same is not applicable. The model did not make a comparative judgment
        based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO, I cannot confirm
        that Sabapathy's V.I.P has a longer runtime than Boris Durov's Pirates of
        the 20th Century based on the information available to me." This is a case
        where the model is saying "NO" but is actually indicating it cannot determine
        the answer due to lack of information, not making a comparative judgment.
        The model explicitly states it "cannot make a factual comparison between these
        two films" because it cannot identify one of the films or find its runtime.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNKNOWN" as its final
        answer and explains that it "cannot provide a YES or NO answer because I don't
        have sufficient information about the runtime of Sabapathy's V. I. P. to make

        it "cannot verify the existence of 'Mr. Sampati'" and therefore "cannot determine

        not because the runtimes are equal. The model states it "cannot establish
        that it has a longer runtime" rather than claiming the runtimes are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. The model concludes that S. S. Vasan's "Mr. Sampati" does not have

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't verify information about one of the films.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final answer,
        but this is followed by an explanation that indicates the model cannot verify
        information about one of the films. The model is essentially saying "NO, I
        cannot confirm" which falls under the UNKNOWN category according to the criteria.

        This is a case where the model is saying "NO" but is actually indicating it

        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response. The model concludes that "Lakshmi Kataksham" has a longer total
        runtime than "The Brigand of Kandahar" based on its reasoning about typical
        runtimes of Telugu mythological films compared to British adventure films.
