        were different (150 minutes vs. 95 minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer, acknowledging that

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model clarifies that this NO means it cannot verify the comparison
        due to lack of information about one film's runtime. This is a case where

        not give a NO answer based on equal values - in fact, it explicitly noted
        the values were different (122 minutes vs 67 minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer. The model recognized
        that since Sky High's runtime (122 minutes) is longer than Ben 10's runtime
        (67 minutes), the correct answer to whether Sky High has a longer runtime
        than Ben 10 is "YES".

        be provided due to insufficient information about 'Mr. Sampati.'" This indicates
        the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of information about one
        of the films. The model is not giving a clear YES/NO comparative answer, but
        rather stating it cannot determine the answer.

        (the model couldn't make the comparison due to lack of information), this
        question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer to this question because I lack sufficient information about
        one of the films mentioned." The model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to missing information about one of the films, which falls under the UNKNOWN
        category.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot provide a definitive YES
        or NO answer" because it lacks information about one of the films. The model
        doesn't make a comparative judgment but instead indicates it cannot determine
        the answer due to insufficient information.

        (not NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions:

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot confirm
        that S. S. Vasan's 'Mr. Sampati' has a longer runtime than Seijun Suzuki's
        'Kanto Wanderer' because I lack sufficient information about the first film."
        This is a case where the model says "NO" but is actually indicating it cannot
        determine the answer due to insufficient information, not making a comparative
        judgment. According to the criteria, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response, indicating that "Juan & Ted: Wanted" has a longer runtime than "War
        Story" (even though it notes uncertainty about the director of "War Story").'

        and not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions:
        "If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model''s final answer is "NO - I cannot confirm
        that Al Tantay''s ''Juan & Ted: Wanted'' has a longer runtime than Peter Lord''s
        ''War Story'' because I cannot verify the existence or runtime of the latter
        film." This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify" and
        indicating it cannot make the comparison because it cannot verify the existence
        of one of the films. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as per the instructions.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes of the two movies and determining that Vidukathai's

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" because it doesn't have runtime information for one of the films.
        The model acknowledges it cannot make a definitive comparison without complete
        information.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response after comparing the runtimes of the two movies and concluding that
        "Vidukathai" has a longer runtime than "The Man Inside."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values is automatically False according to
        the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question because I lack the specific runtime information
        for both films." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to
        insufficient information, which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether
        it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" because it lacks complete information on both films' runtimes.
        It acknowledges not having specific runtime information for "Vidukathai" while
        having information for "The Man Inside." Since the model clearly indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information, this falls
        under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, Agathiyan's 'Vidukathai'
        has a longer total runtime than Bobby Roth's 'The Man Inside'". This is a
        clear YES answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer to this question based on the information available to me." The
        model indicates it lacks the necessary information to make the comparison
        between the runtimes of the two films.

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" because it lacks information about the runtime of one of the
        movies. The model doesn't refuse to answer but indicates it cannot determine
        the comparison due to incomplete information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer based on equal values - in fact, it determined the values
        were different (140 minutes vs 103 minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself, explicitly stating "YES" as its final answer after realizing its error.
        The final conclusion was "So the correct answer is: YES"'
