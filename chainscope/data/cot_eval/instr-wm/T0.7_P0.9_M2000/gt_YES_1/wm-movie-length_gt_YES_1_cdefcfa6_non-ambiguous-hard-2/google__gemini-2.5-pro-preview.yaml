        and concludes that Rustlers' Rhapsody does not have a longer runtime than
        Supertwink because it has a shorter runtime, not because they have equal runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, and also states "Therefore, Rustlers' Rhapsody does not have a longer
        total runtime than Supertwink." This is a clear negative comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        In fact, it explicitly noted that 88 minutes is not longer than 135 minutes,
        indicating a clear difference between the two values. The model gave a NO
        answer because the first movie is shorter than the second, not because they
        have equal runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after determining that 88 minutes (Rustlers' Rhapsody) is not longer than
        135 minutes (Supertwink).
