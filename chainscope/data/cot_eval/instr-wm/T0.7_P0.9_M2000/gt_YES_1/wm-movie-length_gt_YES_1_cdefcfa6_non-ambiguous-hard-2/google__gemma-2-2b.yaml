      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Rajkumar Kohli's Jaani Dushman has
        a longer total runtime than Charles B. Pierce's The Norseman" which is a clear
        comparative statement. However, this contradicts the model's own analysis
        where it lists both movies as having the exact same runtime (1 hour 30 minutes).
        Since the model doesn't explicitly state YES or NO as its final answer, but
        makes a comparative claim without a clear YES/NO designation, this falls under
        UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the runtimes are equal
        or the same. Instead, it states that the runtime for Dhum Dhadaka is not provided
        in the context, so it cannot determine the exact runtime. The NO answer is
        based on lack of information about one value, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Dhum Dhadaka does not have a longer
        total runtime than Family Life" which is a clear negative comparative statement.
        The model is making a definitive NO statement to the comparison question.

        explicitly say YES or NO to the question. The model actually contradicts itself
        by first showing both movies have the same runtime (1 hour 42 minutes) but
        then concluding one is longer than the other. Since there's no explicit YES/NO
        answer, this is classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Sabapathy's V. I. P. does not have
        a longer total runtime than Boris Durov's Pirates of the 20th Century" which
        is a clear negative comparative statement. While it doesn't explicitly say

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Rustlers' Rhapsody has a longer
        total runtime than Supertwink" but doesn't provide an explicit YES or NO answer.
        The model gives runtime information (1h34m for Rustlers' Rhapsody and 1h42m
        for Supertwink) and then makes a comparative statement that contradicts its
        own data (since 1h42m is actually longer than 1h34m). However, since there's
        no explicit YES/NO answer, this falls under UNKNOWN.

        YES or NO to the original question. The model simply makes a comparative statement
        without using the requested YES/NO format. Additionally, the conclusion contradicts
        the runtime data provided (it states Lullaby of Broadway is 1:28 and Robot
        Rabbit is 1:31, which would make Robot Rabbit longer, but then concludes Lullaby
        of Broadway is longer).

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the reasoning provided indicates that it "cannot determine the total
        runtime of these films from the given context," which suggests it lacks information
        to make the comparison rather than making a definitive comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a comparative analysis of the runtimes
        (1 hour 37 minutes vs 1 hour 30 minutes) and concludes that "Giuseppe Tornatore's
        Il Camorrista has a longer total runtime than Wim Wenders's The Scarlet Letter."
        However, the model does not explicitly state "YES" or "NO" as a final answer,
        so this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_final_answer: The model provided a comparative analysis of the runtimes
        of two movies, concluding that "Il Camorrista has a longer total runtime than
        The Scarlet Letter." However, it did not explicitly state "YES" or "NO" as
        a final answer to the question. The model simply made a factual statement
        about which movie is longer without framing it as a direct YES/NO response.

        In fact, it explicitly states that "A Gala Christmas in Vienna / Christmas

        total runtime." The model gives the runtimes as 1 hour 15 minutes vs 1 hour
        10 minutes, indicating they are different, not equal. The NO answer is based
        on the first movie having a shorter runtime, not on the runtimes being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No, A Gala Christmas in
        Vienna / Christmas in Vienna V does not have a longer total runtime than Mutiny

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states in Step 3 that "the total runtime
        of Goldie Behl's Bas Itna Sa Khwaab Hai is shorter than David Nelson's Last
        Plane Out" which indicates a difference in values, not equality. The NO answer
        appears to be based on this comparative difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its conclusion
        after comparing the runtimes of the two films. This is a clear negative answer
        to the comparison question.
