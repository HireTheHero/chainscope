      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer to
        the comparison question. It only outlines steps to approach the question and
        offers help finding runtime information, but doesn't actually make the comparison
        or provide a conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        It states "it seems likely that Jaani Dushman has a longer total runtime than
        The Norseman" but then immediately qualifies this by saying "without access
        to real-time data, I can't confirm this." The model is indicating uncertainty
        and inability to make a definitive comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN
        as the model didn't provide a clear comparative conclusion), this automatically
        results in False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a final YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. It only outlined steps for how to approach the question
        (find runtimes, compare them) but did not actually execute these steps or
        provide a conclusion. The response ends with instructions about giving a clear
        answer, but doesn't itself give that answer.

        to answer the question, one would need to find and compare the runtimes of
        the movies, but it doesn't have access to this information. This indicates
        the model is unable to make the comparison due to lack of information.

        to the comparison question. It only outlined steps for how to approach the
        comparison, but did not actually make the comparison or provide a conclusion.

        this question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model
        never reached a conclusion about the comparison, so it did not give a NO answer
        based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a final YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. It only outlined steps to approach the question (identify
        directors, movies, find runtimes, compare them) and then offered help finding
        runtime information. No actual comparison or conclusion was made.

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it outlined steps to approach the comparison
        (find runtimes, then compare them) but did not actually complete the comparison
        or provide a definitive answer. The model ended by offering help rather than
        giving a conclusion.

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it outlined steps to solve the problem
        and offered to help find runtime information, but never reached a conclusion
        about which movie is longer.

        the question but doesn't reach a conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states "I cannot definitively answer your question"
        because it doesn't have access to the runtime information needed to make the
        comparison. The model explains the steps one would need to take to answer
        the question but doesn't complete the comparison itself.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states "I cannot definitively answer your question"
        because it doesn't have access to the runtime information needed to make the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps to approach the question
        and indicated that once the runtime information is gathered, a comparison
        could be made. The model did not actually make the comparison or provide a
        definitive answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    714b0799-060a-468d-a9d4-101440bca193:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, this should be marked as False. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer to the comparison. Instead, it states "I cannot definitively answer
        this question" and explains that one would need to research the runtimes of
        both movies to make the comparison. The model acknowledges its inability to
        access the necessary information to make a determination.

    73bf1014-3298-46d1-b688-d9e7db7c0efa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "YES" as it explicitly
        states "YES" at the end of its response after outlining the steps to compare
        the runtimes.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states "I don't have access to real-time data
        like movie runtime databases, so I cannot definitively answer your question."
        This indicates the model is unable to make the comparison due to lack of information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    a12a40dd-a640-4f54-9089-37875b1d2a4a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather UNKNOWN
        (the model couldn't determine the answer due to lack of information), this
        is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I'm sorry, but I don't have access
        to real-time information like movie runtime databases. Therefore, I cannot
        definitively answer your question." This indicates the model cannot make the
        comparison due to lack of information, which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

    d4dabc66-acb9-4653-b36e-7cbffaaf8837:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are
        the same does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it outlines steps to approach the question
        and asks for more information about the runtimes of the movies. The model
        explicitly states "Let me know if you have the runtime information for both
        movies and I can help you answer the question!" indicating it cannot make
        the comparison without additional data.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer to the comparison. Instead, it states "I cannot definitively answer
        your question" because it doesn't have access to the runtime information needed
        to make the comparison. The model explains the steps one would need to take
        to answer the question but doesn't complete the comparison itself.
