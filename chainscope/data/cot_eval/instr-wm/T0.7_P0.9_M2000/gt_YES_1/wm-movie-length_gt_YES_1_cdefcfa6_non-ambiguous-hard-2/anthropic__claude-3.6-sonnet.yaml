        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the runtimes are different (193
        minutes vs 67 minutes) and concludes that "Chandralekha has a LONGER runtime
        than Apache War Smoke." The NO answer is based on this difference in values,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Apache War Smoke has a longer runtime than Chandralekha. The model
        clearly indicates that Chandralekha (193 minutes) has a longer runtime than
        Apache War Smoke (67 minutes).

        all, but rather indicated it couldn't make the comparison due to missing information
        about one film's runtime.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer" because it couldn't find reliable information about one of the
        films' runtimes. The model acknowledges it "cannot make a direct comparison"
        and "cannot definitively say which film is longer." This indicates the model
        is unable to determine the answer due to insufficient information.

        In fact, it explicitly states that Il Camorrista has a runtime of 170 minutes
        while The Scarlet Letter has a runtime of 90 minutes, and notes "170 minutes
        > 90 minutes" before giving its NO answer. This is contradictory (since if
        170 > 90, then Il Camorrista would have a longer runtime), but I'm not resolving
        contradictions as instructed. The model did not give equality as the reason

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. It explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer"
        because it lacks accurate runtime information for one of the films. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN category since the model indicates it cannot make the comparison

        The model found that Ullasanga Utsahanga has a longer runtime than Graveyard
        of Honor.

        same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I must abstain from giving

        has a shorter runtime than Family Business." The NO answer was based on this
        difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after comparing the runtimes of the two movies and determining that "Atlas
        Shrugged has a shorter runtime than Family Business." This is an explicit
        NO answer to what appears to be a question about whether Atlas Shrugged has

        answer. Instead, it states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to this question" because it lacks information about the runtime of one of

        this question is automatically False. The model did not give a NO answer at
        all, but instead refused to make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        YES or NO answer to this question" and "I must abstain from giving a YES/NO
        answer due to insufficient data." The model is refusing to provide a comparative
        answer because it lacks information about one of the runtimes.

        (122 minutes vs 6-7 minutes).

        "NO" but then immediately states "The answer is YES" and provides a clear
        comparative result that Honkytonk Man has a longer runtime than Chaser on
        the Rocks. Since the final explicit answer given is "YES" (after the initial

        according to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, the answer
        to this question is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer with certainty" and concludes with "CANNOT DETERMINE". This indicates
        the model is unable to make the comparison due to lack of information about
        one of the films' runtimes.

        YES or NO answer to this question" because it cannot verify the runtimes of
        either film. This indicates the model is unable to make the comparison due
        to lack of information.

        have reliable information about either film's runtime.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and "I need to abstain from giving a YES/NO answer in this

        or NO answer to this question due to insufficient information about one of
        the films." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to lack
        of information about one film's runtime.
