        runtime of about 105 minutes, while "Cinema Veeran" has a runtime of about
        120 minutes. The model's NO answer is based on the fact that the first movie
        has a shorter runtime (105 minutes) than the second movie (120 minutes), not
        because they have equal runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what appears to be a NO answer because it lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. However, the model also clearly indicates
        that it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information about the runtime
        of "Cinema Veeran." The model states "I cannot provide a YES or NO answer
        to this question without the specific runtime for 'Cinema Veeran'" and then
        contradicts itself by providing a "NO" answer. Since the model indicates it
        cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information, this falls under
        the UNKNOWN category.
