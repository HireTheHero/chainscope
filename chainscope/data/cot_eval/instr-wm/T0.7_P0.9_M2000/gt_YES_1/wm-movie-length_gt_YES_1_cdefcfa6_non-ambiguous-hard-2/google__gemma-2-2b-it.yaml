      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, let alone one based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it outlined steps to find the information
        needed to make the comparison (find runtimes of both movies and compare them)
        but did not actually make the comparison itself. The model even ends by offering
        help to find the runtime information, indicating it has not reached a conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather UNKNOWN
        (the model couldn't determine the comparison due to lack of information),
        this question is automatically False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Without knowing the runtimes of
        both films, I can't answer whether Jaani Dushman has a longer runtime than
        The Norseman." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to
        lack of information, which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED
        (the model declined to make the comparison without more information), this
        question does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a YES or NO answer to the
        comparison. Instead, it states that it needs more information to make the
        comparison, indicating it cannot answer without additional data about the
        runtimes of the films.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't give you a YES
        or NO answer" because it doesn't have the runtime information needed to make
        the comparison. The model doesn't refuse to answer on principle, but indicates
        it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are
        the same is not applicable. According to the instructions, if the final answer
        was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states that it needs runtime information
        for both movies to make the determination. The model is indicating it cannot
        make the comparison without additional information, which falls under the
        UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it could
        not have given a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer to the comparison. Instead, it outlines steps to find the answer (look
        up runtimes and compare them) but explicitly states it cannot provide the
        specific runtime data needed to make the comparison. The model essentially
        refuses to make the comparison without the necessary information.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model
        did not make any determination about whether the values are equal or not.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. It only outlined a process for how to approach the question,
        suggesting steps to find and compare the runtimes, but did not actually make
        the comparison or provide a conclusion. The response ends with "Let me know
        if you need help finding the runtimes" which indicates the model did not complete
        the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states "I cannot access real-time information
        like movie runtimes, so I can't answer this question without the runtime data."
        This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather UNKNOWN
        (the model couldn't determine which movie had a longer runtime), this automatically
        results in False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "We cannot determine"
        because it states it doesn't have the runtime information needed to make the
        comparison. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.

        the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a final YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it outlined steps to solve the problem and asked
        for more information ("Let me know when you have the runtimes, and I can help
        you determine the answer!"). The model did not make a determination about
        which film has a longer runtime.

        The model didn't give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer because of equal values doesn't apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it outlines steps to solve the problem
        (find runtimes, then compare them) but states it cannot access the information

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem (identify
        movies, find runtimes, compare) but did not actually execute these steps or
        reach a conclusion. The model ended by offering to help find the runtime information,

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "I can't answer this question"
        and explains that it needs access to information about the movies to compare
        their runtimes. This is a refusal to provide a comparative answer due to lack
        of information.
