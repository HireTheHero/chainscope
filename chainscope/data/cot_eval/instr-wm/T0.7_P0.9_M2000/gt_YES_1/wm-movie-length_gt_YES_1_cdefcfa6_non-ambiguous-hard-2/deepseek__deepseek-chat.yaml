      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. Instead, it states "without specific runtime data for these movies,
        I cannot definitively answer the question." The model indicates it lacks the
        necessary information to make the comparison and requests additional data
        to proceed with an answer.
