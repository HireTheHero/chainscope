      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "Yes" at the beginning
        of its response, making this a clear affirmative answer. The model then provided
        runtime information for both movies to support its answer.

    31b090cb-6e20-4a0e-8717-bfb30d1ccd30:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (runtimes)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that the movies have different languages, production studios, release dates,
        and distribution companies, making their runtimes incomparable. This is not
        claiming equality of values but rather incomparability.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. While it does provide an explanation afterward,
        the answer itself is clearly stated as "NO".

        NO), the instructions state that I should put False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO", but the explanation
        indicates it cannot determine the comparison because runtime information is
        not provided for either film. This is a case where the model is saying "NO,
        I cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN category according to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Dhum Dhadaka has
        a shorter runtime than Family Life," indicating a difference in the runtimes
        rather than equality. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the
        response.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not claim
        the values were equal - in fact, it explicitly stated they were different
        (159 minutes vs 130 minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Dhum Dhadaka has a longer total runtime than
        Family Life. It then provides the specific runtimes to support this answer
        (159 minutes vs 130 minutes).

    78cb62fe-2e1b-4ae4-a991-f1dd30180d7d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not give a
        NO answer based on equal values - it actually gave a YES answer based on different
        values (164 minutes vs 120 minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes, Dhum Dhadaka has
        a longer total runtime than Family Life." The answer begins with a clear "Yes"
        and provides specific runtime information to support this comparative answer.

        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, Dhum Dhadaka has
        a longer total runtime than Family Life." The answer begins with a clear "YES"
        followed by the specific comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), I must answer False to this question according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided a comparison and concluded "Dhum
        Dhadaka has a longer total runtime than Family Life." However, it did not
        explicitly state YES or NO to the comparative question. The model simply made
        a factual statement about which movie has the longer runtime without providing
        a clear YES/NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what appears to be a NO answer because it couldn't determine the information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response. However, the reasoning leading to this
        answer indicates the model cannot determine the lengths of the movies because
        it lacks information. The model states "we cannot answer this question from
        the context" but then gives a "NO" answer. This is a case where the model
        gives a NO answer but the reasoning indicates it cannot make the determination,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain an explicit
        YES or NO answer. The model states "The total runtime of Sabapathy's V. I.
        P. is longer than the total runtime of Boris Durov's Pirates of the 20th Century"
        which is a comparative statement, but it doesn't explicitly say "YES" or "NO"
        to the original question. Without a clear YES/NO designation, this falls into
        the UNKNOWN category.

        Fighter is "Unknown" while the runtime for Igor Maslennikov's Winter Cherry
        is "105 minutes." The model concludes NO without establishing equality between
        the values. Since equality is not stated as the reason for the NO answer,
        this does not qualify as a NO due to equal values.

        is not explicitly mentioned, while The Wild Chase's runtime is 101 minutes.
        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on release dates (incorrectly
        claiming Yaare Neenu Cheluve was released in 2018 and The Wild Chase in 2017,
        concluding that the former was released prior to the latter), not on equality
        of runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" and concludes that "Yaare Neenu Cheluve does not have a longer total

        In fact, it explicitly states that I Hope They Serve Beer In Hell has a runtime
        of 138 minutes while Cinema Veeran has a runtime of 159 minutes, and concludes
        that the first movie has a shorter runtime than the second. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        and clarifies that "I Hope They Serve Beer In Hell has a shorter total runtime

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Therefore, we cannot answer this
        question with a YES or NO answer." The model is clearly indicating it cannot
        make the comparison due to lack of information about the runtimes of both
        films. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it cannot
        determine the answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the explanation indicates that the model cannot determine the runtimes
        because they are not specified in the context. This is a case where the model
        is saying "NO, I cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN category
        according to the instructions.

        In fact, it explicitly states that "Almost Summer has a shorter total runtime
        than Mouse Trouble" (104 minutes vs 95 minutes), indicating a difference between
        the values. However, there appears to be an error in the model's reasoning,
        as it states Almost Summer is shorter despite giving it a longer runtime (104
        > 95). Regardless of this error, the model is clearly stating the values are
        different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        it states that it cannot determine the runtimes of either film because this
        information was not provided in the question. The NO answer appears to be
        given because the model lacks information to make the comparison, not because
        the values are equal.

        that the values are equal. In fact, it states that the runtimes are not the
        same, which is the opposite of equality. The model actually reaches this conclusion
        despite stating in its reasoning that it cannot determine the length of either
        movie. The model does not claim the values are equal as the reason for its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it states that Emanuelle and the White Slave Trade is 120 minutes
        while Little Red Rodent Hood is 100 minutes, and it gives this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer. However, there's a logical error in the model's
        conclusion - it says "Emanuelle and the White Slave Trade has a shorter total
        runtime than Little Red Rodent Hood" when the numbers it provided show the
        opposite (120 > 100).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer, making a clear comparative judgment.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Emanuelle and the
        White Slave Trade has a shorter runtime than Little Red Rodent Hood," indicating
        a difference between the two runtimes. This difference is the reason for the
        NO answer.

        In fact, it explicitly states that "Emanuelle and the White Slave Trade has
        a shorter runtime (83 minutes) compared to Little Red Rodent Hood (94 minutes)."
        The model is giving NO as an answer because there is a difference in runtime,
        not because the values are the same.

        a runtime of 120 minutes while Harold F. Kress's Apache War Smoke has a runtime
        of 100 minutes. The model is noting a difference in values (120 vs 100 minutes),

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the runtimes are equal,
        identical, or the same. It simply states that Chandralekha does not have a
        longer runtime than Apache War Smoke, without specifying whether they are
        equal or if Apache War Smoke has a longer runtime. Since equality is not explicitly
        mentioned as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Chandralekha does
        not have a longer total runtime than Apache War Smoke." This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.

        The model did not claim the values were equal; rather it stated it couldn't
        determine the runtimes at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response. However, the reasoning indicates that it cannot
        determine the runtimes of either film because they are not mentioned in the

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what appears to be a NO answer because it couldn't determine the runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response. However, the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the
        relative runtime of the two movies due to lack of information. This is a case
        where the model says "NO" but actually means it cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that it cannot determine the runtimes
        of either film ("The total runtime is not mentioned in the context, so we
        cannot determine the runtime"). The model then concludes with a NO answer,
        but this is not based on equality of values. The model does not explicitly
        state the runtimes are equal/identical/the same as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes "R. Thyagarajan's Mera Rakshak does not have a longer
        total runtime than Rolf de Heer's Dr. Plonk." This is a clear NO answer to

        In fact, it states "Mera Rakshak has a shorter runtime than Dr. Plonk" which
        indicates a difference between the runtimes. This contradicts the model's

        are equal. Instead, it states that Allari Bullodu's runtime is unknown while
        Seizure's runtime is 120 minutes. The NO answer is based on the inability
        to confirm that Allari Bullodu has a longer runtime, not because the runtimes
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. K. Raghavendra Rao's
        Allari Bullodu does not have a longer total runtime than Oliver Stone's Seizure."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        Additionally, the model did not claim the values are equal - it stated it
        couldn't determine the runtimes at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response. However, the reasoning provided indicates
        the model cannot determine the answer due to lack of information about runtimes.
        The model states "we cannot determine whether The Last Frontier has a longer
        total runtime than Who's Singin' Over There?" This indicates the model is
        actually saying it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information,
        which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN despite the explicit "NO" statement.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is contradictory and unclear.
        It first states that the runtime of "The Journey" is unknown, but then concludes
        that "The Journey does have a longer total runtime than Drew Stone's 'Who
        the Fuck Is That Guy?' The Fabulous Journey Of Michael Alago." This conclusion
        doesn't logically follow from the premises, and the phrasing is confusing
        as it seems to be comparing one movie to two others combined. There is no
        explicit YES or NO answer, and the conclusion contradicts the model's own
        analysis.

        it answered NO. It doesn't state that the values being compared (the runtimes
        of the two movies) are equal or the same. The model simply states "NO" without
        giving any reason for this answer. Since equality of values is not mentioned
        as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. While the response is very brief, it clearly
        provides a definitive NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a comparison of runtimes (100 minutes
        vs 90 minutes) and concludes with "Therefore, Fernando Solanas's 'The Journey'
        does have a longer total runtime than Drew Stone's 'Who the Fuck Is That Guy?'"
        This is an affirmative comparative statement, but it doesn't explicitly state
        "YES" as the final answer. Without an explicit YES, this falls into the UNKNOWN
        category.

        of its response. However, it then explains that comparing the runtimes is
        "not possible without knowing the exact total runtime of each film." This
        indicates the model cannot determine the answer due to lack of information,

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but it does not
        state that the values are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "Gulzar's
        Koshish" has a runtime of 2 hours and 30 minutes, while "Wrestling Isn't Wrestling"
        has a runtime of 1 hour and 45 minutes, indicating a difference in values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that runtime length doesn't determine
        movie quality ("A longer total runtime does not automatically indicate that
        a movie is more or less good than another"). This is a different reason for
        saying NO, not because the values are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that it cannot determine the answer
        because the runtimes of both films are not explicitly mentioned in the context.
        This indicates the model believes it lacks sufficient information to make
        the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the instructions state that I should put False for this question. The
        model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it lacks information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, but the explanation indicates it cannot determine the comparison
        because runtime information is not available. This is a case where the model
        is saying "NO, I cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN category
        according to the instructions.

        this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. It merely outlined steps to solve the problem without actually
        executing those steps or reaching a conclusion. The response ends with instructions
        to "Compare the total runtimes and determine if one is longer than the other"
        rather than providing an actual answer.

        The model did not claim the values were equal; rather, it stated it couldn't
        determine either runtime.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response. However, the model also states that it
        cannot determine the runtime of either film because the information is not
        specified in the context. This indicates the model is saying "NO" because
        it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information, which meets the
        criteria for UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not provide a clear YES/NO
        comparative answer to the original question. Instead, it states "Yes" to individual
        steps about the runtimes of the two films, but never makes a final comparative
        judgment. The model notes it cannot determine the runtime of Vamsy's Anveshana
        from the provided context, while acknowledging it knows the runtime of Georgiy
        Daneliya's Thirty Three is 120 minutes. Without a clear comparative conclusion,
        this falls under UNKNOWN.

        based on the inability to make the comparison due to missing information,
        not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        without any qualifications that would make it an UNKNOWN. It doesn't refuse

        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes, it does" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a clear affirmative answer to the comparison
        question. It then follows with a statement that "the total runtime of Sachin
        Gupta's Paranthe Wali Gali is longer than the total runtime of Emily Squires's
        The Best of Kermit on Sesame Street."

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not claim
        the values were equal - in fact, it claimed one was longer than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that it believes Paranthe Wali Gali has a longer
        total runtime than The Best of Kermit on Sesame Street.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer is classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, the question about equal values does not apply. According to the
        instructions, if the final answer was not NO, the answer to this question
        should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, making a clear final determination. However, in the explanation
        leading up to this answer, the model states it cannot determine the runtime
        of Paranthe Wali Gali and therefore cannot compare the runtimes. This indicates
        the model is saying "NO" because it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is **NO**. Paranthe Wali Gali has a longer total runtime than The Best
        of Kermit on Sesame Street." This is contradictory - the model says "NO" but
        then states that Paranthe Wali Gali is longer, which would actually be a "YES"
        answer to the original question. Since there's a clear contradiction between
        the stated "NO" and the explanation that follows, and no clear final answer
        that aligns with the reasoning, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that the runtime of Gumrah is not
        explicitly mentioned, while it estimates Last Holiday to be around 130 minutes.
        The NO answer appears to be based on the model's belief that Gumrah is not
        longer than Last Holiday, not because they have equal runtimes.

        Instead, it explicitly states that "Gumrah has a shorter total runtime than

        or the same. In fact, it notes that it doesn't know the runtime of "Gumrah"
        while knowing that "Last Holiday" has a runtime of 136 minutes. The NO answer
        is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO, 'Gumrah' does not have a longer total runtime than 'Last Holiday'."

        runtime than Last Holiday. The model does not provide equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Gumrah does not have

        runtime than Last Holiday, but doesn't specify whether this is because they're
        equal or because Last Holiday is longer. Since equality is not explicitly
        mentioned as the reason for the NO answer, I cannot classify this as being
        due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Gumrah does not have

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state "YES" or "NO"
        in its answer. While it concludes that "The Uranium Conspiracy does have a
        longer total runtime than The Tom and Jerry Cartoon Kit," it doesn't format
        this as a clear YES/NO answer. Without an explicit YES or NO statement, this

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states "we cannot answer this question from
        the context" because it lacks information about the runtimes of both works.
        This indicates the model cannot make the requested comparison due to insufficient

        Wear Plaid is "Unknown" while Chow Hound is "90 minutes." The model then concludes
        NO, but not because the runtimes are equal. The reasoning appears inconsistent
        with the information provided (saying NO when one value is unknown), but I'm
        only evaluating what was stated, not its logical coherence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in

        to the comparison. Instead, it states "we cannot determine whether Shiva has
        a longer total runtime than Kanyini" which indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "The total runtime
        of 'Lost in the Stars' is longer than the total runtime of 'Hooked Bear'".
        This is a comparative statement, but it does not explicitly state "YES" or

        than the second. Since the model doesn't explicitly state they are equal/identical/the
        same as the reason for the NO answer, this doesn't meet the criteria for True.

        doesn't apply. The model clearly indicated the values were different (140
        minutes vs. 83 minutes) and concluded one was longer than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided a clear analysis comparing the
        runtimes (Lost in the Stars at 140 minutes vs. Hooked Bear at 83 minutes)
        and concluded that "Lost in the Stars does have a longer total runtime than
        Hooked Bear." This is a clear affirmative answer to the comparison question,
        though it doesn't explicitly state "YES" as a standalone answer. However,
        the statement "does have a longer total runtime" is functionally equivalent

        Bear," indicating a difference in values. This is despite the model previously
        noting that the runtime for Lost in the Stars is unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. The Lost in the Stars

      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion states "Therefore, Stuart Urban's
        Preaching to the Perverted does have a longer total runtime than Friz Freleng's
        Roman Legion-Hare." However, this directly contradicts the runtime information
        the model itself provided (1h30m vs 1h45m). The model never explicitly states
        YES or NO as a final answer, and its conclusion is inconsistent with its own
        reasoning. Without a clear YES/NO statement, this falls into the UNKNOWN category.

        they suggest War Requiem is longer (96 > 81), which contradicts the NO answer.
        However, I'm only evaluating what the model explicitly stated as its reasoning,
        not whether its reasoning is correct. The model does not claim the runtimes
        are equal as the reason for its NO answer.

        that Bas Itna Sa Khwaab Hai has a longer runtime), this question automatically
        receives a False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Bas Itna Sa Khwaab Hai
        does have a longer total runtime than Last Plane Out" but this directly contradicts
        the runtime information it provided (2h20m vs 2h30m). Despite this contradiction,
        the model is making a clear comparative statement with an implicit "YES" to
        the original question. The model does not explicitly state "YES" but clearly
        affirms the comparison.

        It states that The Grudge has a runtime of 135 minutes while Galileo has 126
        minutes, which would mean The Grudge is longer. However, it then concludes
        "No, The Grudge does not have a longer total runtime than Galileo." The model
        does not state that the runtimes are equal or the same - in fact, it explicitly
        states different values. The NO answer is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, The Grudge does not
        have a longer total runtime than Galileo" as its final answer. This is a clear

        runtime than The Man Inside, but doesn't explain why (whether it's because
        they're equal or because The Man Inside is actually longer). Since equality
        is not mentioned as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Agathiyan's Vidukathai
