      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it determines

        it states that "Mad as a Mars Hare" (7:22) is longer than "I'll Get You for

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, the model explicitly states different runtimes
        (88 minutes vs. 7 minutes) and acknowledges that one is longer than the other.
        The model's reasoning actually contradicts its "NO" answer, as it concludes
        that "since 88 > 7, the answer should be YES" but mistakenly wrote "NO". The
        equality of values was not given as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the beginning
        of its response. Although the model later contradicts itself in its explanation
        and suggests the answer should be "YES", the explicit final answer given was
        "NO".

        Instead, it explicitly compares the runtimes and states that "Mad as a Mars

        that "Since 7.5 minutes > 7 minutes, Mad as a Mars Hare is longer." The model's

        that "Mad as a Mars Hare" (7+ minutes) is longer than "I'll Get You for This"
        (~6:45). The model is not saying the values are equal or the same, but rather
        that one is longer than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model concludes that "Mad as a Mars
        Hare" (7+ minutes) is longer than "I'll Get You for This" (~6:45), and therefore

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        in the conclusion section. The model compares the runtime of Kore-eda's "Distance"
        (124 minutes) with Chiniquy's "Hawaiian Aye Aye" (108 minutes) and concludes
        that since 124 minutes is longer than 108 minutes, the answer is "YES".

        Instead, it explicitly states that Hawaiian Aye Aye (153 minutes) is longer
        than Distance (121 minutes). The model gives a NO answer because it found
        that Hawaiian Aye Aye has a longer runtime, not because the runtimes are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Hirokazu Kore-eda's movie "Distance" has a longer
        total runtime than Gerry Chiniquy's "Hawaiian Aye Aye." The answer is direct
        and unambiguous.

        - it estimates Chandralekha at 160-170 minutes and Apache War Smoke at 70-80
        minutes, concluding they have significantly different runtimes. The model's
        "NO" answer contradicts its own reasoning, but nowhere does it claim the runtimes
        are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model''s final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        Instead, it explicitly states that Apache War Smoke has a longer runtime (225

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values.
        Instead, the model states that George Montgomery did not star in a movie titled
        "Satan's Harvest" with the described role. The reason for the NO is the claimed
        non-existence of the connection between the actor and the movie/role, not
        that two values being compared are equal.

        of its final answer, followed by an explanation that "George Montgomery did
        not star as a sheriff leading a group against a cult in a movie titled Satan's
        Harvest." This is a clear negative response to the question.

        Instead, it explicitly states different runtimes for the two films (78 minutes
        for Jane and the Lost City vs. 88 minutes for Revenge of the Brick) and concludes
        NO because Jane and the Lost City is shorter than Revenge of the Brick.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clear and direct, without any qualifications
        that would make it an UNKNOWN.

        movie *Mad as a Mars Hare* is directed by **Robert McKimson**, so it is **not**
        directed by someone else." This is not a case where two values are found to
        be equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that both
        cartoons likely have similar runtimes. It states "Both cartoons likely have
        similar runtimes (~7 minutes)" as the basis for its NO answer. The model explicitly
        states they have equal values (similar runtimes of ~7 minutes) as the primary
        reason for the NO answer.

        because it lacks evidence that "Preaching to the Perverted" exceeds the runtime
        of "Roman Legion-Hare" (which it estimates at ~7.5 minutes), not because they
        have identical runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "Slugs, Muerte Viscosa" has a runtime of
        88 minutes while "The Mitten" has a runtime of 92 minutes. The model concludes
        NO because "88 minutes is shorter than 92 minutes" - indicating a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question of whether "Slugs, Muerte Viscosa" has a longer
        total runtime than "The Mitten". This is a direct comparative answer to the
