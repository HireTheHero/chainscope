      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal.
        Instead, it explicitly noted a difference, estimating Brickerville at less
        than 1,000 residents and Tubac at 1,691 residents. The NO answer was based
        on this difference (Tubac being larger), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Brickerville is more populous than Tubac. This was a clear
        comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it suggests Brickerville is "likely smaller or
        possibly comparable but not significantly larger than Tubac." The NO answer
        is based on the reasoning that Brickerville is likely smaller, not because
        the populations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, making a comparative judgment despite acknowledging uncertainty
        in the data. While the model expresses some uncertainty, it commits to a definitive

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly noted a difference, with Tubac having approximately
        1,691 people and Brickerville having less than 1,000 people. The NO answer
        was based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its comparative
        answer, stating that Tubac, AZ has a larger population than Brickerville,
        PA. The answer was clear and definitive.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined UC Santa Barbara likely
        has a larger population than La Homa, TX, even noting "the university's population
        is likely larger." The NO was based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"

    0b5a70d8-e215-46b2-97ba-cdd8bbd7a7aa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The question of
        whether values are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate this for NO
        answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in its conclusion,
        indicating that La Homa, TX is likely more populous than UC Santa Barbara.
        While the model expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning, it provides a
        clear YES as its final comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - in fact, it suggests that La Homa likely has a smaller population
        than UC Santa Barbara. The NO answer is based on this difference in population
        sizes, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" in a boxed conclusion, making this a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. In fact, it suggests that La Homa "might indeed be less populous than
        the enrollment of UCSB." While it expresses uncertainty about exact numbers,
        it does not base its NO answer on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "ANSWER: NO"
        at the end of its response, making this a clear NO answer despite the complex
        reasoning leading up to it.'

    7857c799-efe2-48bd-85a7-de1c5d63c1ee:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal.
        Instead, it concluded NO because it determined La Homa was "likely very small"
        while UCSB had "significant numbers" (over 28,000), indicating a difference
        in population sizes. The NO answer was based on La Homa being less populous,
        not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "the answer is:
        NO" after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that La Homa, TX is not more

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        population values (12,217 vs 92,306) and explicitly stating that La Homa is
        less populous than Santa Barbara, not because the values are equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing the populations, after determining that La Homa (12,217) is
        less populous than Santa Barbara (92,306)

    df3ea828-9d9f-445e-9aa9-9e53eca677e8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on finding different
        values (12,217 vs 29,000) and specifically states that La Homa is less populous
        than UCSB. The values are not equal or approximately equal, and inequality
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations (12,217 vs 29,000) and finding La Homa to
        be less populous than UCSB.

        at ~92,000.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly gives a final answer of "No"
        in a boxed format at the end of its response. While the model discusses various

      result: 'NO'
    72cb93da-6a5b-4fce-97f1-c07860dcabb0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the populations are equal. In fact, it indicates that one population
        is known (1,484) while the other is unknown but likely smaller. The NO appears
        to be based on the assumption that Rouse, CA is smaller than Capitan, NM,
        not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though it expresses uncertainty about one of the locations. Since
        it provides a definitive NO rather than stating it cannot determine the answer,
        this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    95f2b888-1154-4f2a-9536-55ddd61e7991:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        populations were equal - it actually suggested Rouse was likely smaller, though
        it couldn't verify this.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but qualifies it with uncertainty
        about Rouse's existence/data. Since the model indicates it cannot verify one
        of the values being compared, this falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where
        the model "cannot determine" or "rejects the premises."
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    ab0cc73a-d8a7-48a1-8230-c59ed72b6443:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, even if we had classified the final
        answer as NO, the model never stated the populations were equal - it actually
        indicated uncertainty about one population while knowing the other was around
        1,478.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but qualifies it with
        "assuming Rouse, CA, does not have a significantly larger population." Since
        the model indicates it cannot verify the population of Rouse and bases its
        answer on assumptions rather than data, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
        The model essentially states it cannot make a definitive comparison due to
        lack of data about one location.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        about the likely smaller size of Rouse, CA based on its limited documentation,
        compared to Capitan's known population of 1,484.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a comparative
        conclusion rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        the populations were equal. The model suggests Rouse, CA is likely smaller
        than Capitan, NM (indicating a difference in values), and bases its NO answer
        on this assumed difference rather than on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end,
        making a comparative judgment, even though it acknowledges uncertainty in

        the populations were equal. Instead, it suggested that Landover's population
        would be larger than White Bear Lake's (25,913), inferring this from Landover
        being part of a larger metropolitan area. The NO answer was based on a perceived
        difference in size, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, making a comparative judgment despite acknowledging uncertainty about
        exact figures. While it expresses some uncertainty in the analysis, it does
        provide a definitive NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.

        on equal values.

        it does not state that the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states
        that 2,066 is less than 3,625, and this difference (not equality) is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific population numbers and explaining that Bluewell
        (2,066) is less than Slippery Rock (3,625). The answer is a direct comparative

        population due to the university's presence ("universities can increase the
        population of their host towns"). The NO answer is based on this implied difference
        in populations, not on them being equal.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values are equal. Rather, it made an assumption that Bluewell's population
        would be smaller than Slippery Rock's 3,625 population. The model explicitly
        indicates there would be a difference in values (with Bluewell being smaller),
        even though it acknowledges this is speculative.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it acknowledges uncertainty and notes this is speculative. Since
        it provides a clear NO as its comparative conclusion (rather than saying it
        cannot determine), this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        - in fact, it indicates that Slippery Rock borough "tends to have more residents
        than the area of Bluewell" and gives specific different population ranges
        (Bluewell "below 2,500" vs Slippery Rock "around 3,500 or more"). The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with clear directional reasoning that Bluewell is not more populous

    8f907d3d-bf5d-4832-b51e-7df8be4aa327:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found different
        population values (Danube at 443 and Yonah at 510), not because the values
        are equal. The model explicitly states that Yonah has more residents than
        Danube.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations (510 vs 443) and explicitly concludes that
        Danube, MN is not more populous than Yonah, GA.

        population (567) is greater than Danube's (442), showing a clear difference
        in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        a population "in the hundreds or low thousands." The NO answer was based on
        this difference in population sizes, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        (as a CDP) is likely smaller than Conyers (as a city). While expressing some
        uncertainty about exact numbers, it bases its NO answer on an expected difference
        in populations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        inference that Pinewood is smaller than Conyers, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Pinewood, FL is more populous than Conyers, GA. While the model
        expresses some uncertainty about Pinewood's exact population, it still provides

        it indicated Conyers is "significantly larger" and has a population "in the
        tens of thousands" compared to Pinewood being a "small community". The NO
        answer was based on this difference in size, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        numbers, it does not state that the populations are equal. Instead, it suggests
        Union Bridge is likely more populous than Alleghenyville due to its status
        as an incorporated town vs. an unincorporated community. The NO answer is
        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it acknowledges uncertainty in the data. Since
        it provides a clear NO answer (not qualified with "cannot verify" or similar),
        this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer, stating that Alleghenyville, PA is more populous than Union Bridge,
        MD. While the model acknowledged some uncertainty about exact numbers, it
        still provided a definitive YES answer.

        populations, it does not state that the populations are equal or the same.
        Instead, it suggests that Alleghenyville's population "might be smaller or
        comparable" and ultimately concludes NO based on Union Bridge having a defined
        population while Alleghenyville doesn't. The NO is not based on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Alleghenyville is more populous than Union Bridge. While
        the model expresses uncertainty in the comparison, it still provides a definitive
        NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        population and speculates that it "might be smaller or comparable." Since
        equality is not explicitly stated as the reason for the NO answer, and the
        model suggests possible differences in size, this does not qualify as a NO
        due to equal values.

        rather than equality of values. The model even gives examples where the values
        would be different (500 vs 1500).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be intended as a comparative result rather than inability
        to determine. While the model expresses uncertainty about exact numbers, it
        still provides a definitive NO answer.

        were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one of the populations.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO" in a box, the reasoning
        leading up to it clearly indicates they cannot make the comparison due to
        lack of information about County Center, VA. The model explicitly states "we
        cannot accurately compare" and notes the lack of specific information. This

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning, it does make a comparative

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Green, OH's population
        (25,699) is less than Prior Lake, MN's population (27,617). The NO answer
        was given because of this difference in values, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly states "NO" as its final answer. This is a direct comparative
        result based on population numbers where it found Green, OH (25,699) to be
        less populous than Prior Lake, MN (27,617).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found different
        values (35,682 vs 101,725) and explicitly states that one is less than the
        other. It does not claim the values are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" after
        comparing populations and finding Myrtle Beach has a smaller population than
        Davenport. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.'

        populations (35,682 vs 101,725) and notes that "Davenport, IA, is significantly
        more populous than Myrtle Beach, SC." The NO answer is based on this difference
        in values, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but explicitly states
        there is a difference in populations (35,682 vs 101,725) and describes Davenport
        as "significantly larger." The NO is not due to equal values but due to Davenport
        being larger.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing the populations, with explicit population figures and a clear
        comparative conclusion that Davenport is larger than Myrtle Beach.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because Davenport
        (101,725) is more populous than Myrtle Beach (34,695). It does not state the
        populations are equal - in fact, it explicitly shows they are different. The
        NO is based on Davenport being larger, not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Myrtle Beach is more populous than Davenport, after
        comparing their populations (34,695 vs 101,725)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the values are equal -
        it explicitly states that Myrtle Beach has 34,695 people while Davenport has
        101,725 people, and gives the NO answer because Myrtle Beach's population
        is less than Davenport's ("Since 34,695 is less than 101,725...").

        values (35,682 vs 101,725) and explicitly states "Myrtle Beach, SC is less
        populous than Davenport, IA." The NO is based on this difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, making this a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because Myrtle Beach (34,695)
        is less than Davenport (101,725), not because the values are equal. The model
        explicitly states different population values and uses this difference as
        the reason for its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the populations were equal. Instead, it reasoned that Ridgebury (as part
        of Ridgefield) is likely larger than Experiment, GA. The NO answer was based
        on a perceived difference in population sizes, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its answer,
        even though it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides
        a clear comparative conclusion rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine, this counts as a NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality when the answer
        is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite acknowledging uncertainty in the data. While the
        model noted the speculative nature of the comparison, it still provided a
        clear final answer of "YES".

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        population figures, it does not state that the populations are equal. Instead,
        it suggests that Ridgebury, CT is likely more populous than Experiment, GA
        ("Ridgebury, CT, potentially being more populous"). The NO answer appears
        to be because Ridgebury is believed to be larger, not because the populations
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative answer rather than a rejection
        of the premise or inability to verify. While the model expresses uncertainty
        about exact numbers, it still provides a definitive NO answer to whether Experiment,
        GA is more populous than Ridgebury, CT.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it gives a speculative NO based on the reasoning
        that Ridgebury (as part of Ridgefield) likely has a larger population than
        Experiment, GA. The model explicitly notes this is "highly speculative without
        specific numbers" but suggests a difference in populations as the basis for
        its NO answer.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Experiment, GA (3,867
        people) is less populous than Ridgefield/Ridgebury, CT (25,033 people). The
        NO was based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        Instead, it gave NO based on reasoning that Ridgebury (as part of a larger
        town) might be more populous than Experiment, GA. The uncertainty and incomplete
        data were noted, but equality was not given as the reason for the NO answer.

        the values were equal. Instead, it showed that Gantt (15,223) has a larger
        population than Bradley Gardens (14,077). The NO answer was based on this
        difference in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Bradley Gardens is more populous than Gantt, SC. This
        is a direct comparative answer based on population numbers it provided (14,077

        It did not state the values were equal - in fact, it explicitly noted they
        were different. The NO was based on Clarendon Hills having a lower population,
        not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
