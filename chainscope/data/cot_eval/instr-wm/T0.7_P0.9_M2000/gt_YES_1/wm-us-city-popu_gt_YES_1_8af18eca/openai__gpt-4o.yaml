    0622361e-cbc0-445f-95ae-9d5447ecac3c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both places are described as "small communities,"
        the model explicitly states that Tubac is "likely to have a slightly higher
        population." The NO answer is based on this difference in population, not
        on the populations being equal. Therefore, since the values are described
        as different (even if slightly), this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. The model made a definitive
        comparison, stating that Tubac is likely to have a slightly higher population
        than Brickerville.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2ca187f5-3f31-4755-b984-0c394a18d94c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it suggests that Tubac "might have a slightly higher population"
        than Brickerville. Even though both are described as small, the model indicates
        a difference in population sizes, making this a comparison-based NO rather
        than an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO. Brickerville,
        PA is not more populous than Tubac, AZ." This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3a6c3394-2c48-4534-9611-a59acd4edcbe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both locations are small and
        "comparable," it does not explicitly state they are equal/identical in population.
        In fact, it suggests Tubac might be "possibly larger." Since equality is not
        stated as the reason for the NO answer, and a potential difference is mentioned,
        this does not qualify as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Brickerville,
        PA is not more populous than Tubac, AZ" as a clear comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    47c118f5-1d7f-4590-9f14-9737c7dd2e0a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it infers Brickerville likely has
        a smaller population than Tubac ("reasonable to infer that Brickerville, PA
        has a smaller population than Tubac, AZ"). The NO answer is based on this
        difference in populations, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion to whether Brickerville is more populous than
        Tubac. This is a clear comparative NO answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - in fact, it suggested Tubac "might have a slightly larger population." While
        it noted they were both small communities with "similar" sizes, it indicated
        a difference exists, making this a comparison of unequal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" as a comparative result between the populations.'

    903d8af5-6237-4ad2-af85-8d679510db90:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Brickerville is "likely
        less populous than Tubac," indicating a difference in populations (even if
        estimated). The NO is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" as
        its conclusion to whether Brickerville is more populous than Tubac, making
        this a clear NO response.'

    a48a0ec6-4a4a-46bc-ba90-057c6ce3fd8f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        numbers, it does not state the populations are equal. In fact, it suggests
        Tubac has "a slightly higher population" than Brickerville. The NO answer
        is based on this suggested difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Brickerville,
        PA is not more populous than Tubac, AZ." While there is uncertainty in the
        reasoning, the model does provide a clear NO answer as its final comparative
        conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b9f73e53-435a-4dba-bee8-2d3d8f99cf41:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the populations are equal. Instead, it suggests that Brickerville likely
        has a smaller population than Tubac, noting that "unincorporated communities
        like Brickerville generally have smaller populations compared to census-designated
        places." The NO is based on a difference in populations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Brickerville,
        PA is not more populous than Tubac, AZ." This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d3f0a022-0146-486e-8c19-6fbfcb8b6ac2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the populations are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "Tubac,
        AZ, also has a small population, but it tends to be slightly larger than that
        of very small communities like Brickerville." Since it indicates a difference
        in population (even if its final NO seems inconsistent with this), we must
        classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While this seems to contradict its reasoning (which suggests Tubac is more
        populous), we must take the explicit NO statement as the final answer per
        instructions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f6b2d01a-f3d3-4f38-9fb1-ac05fc2a3097:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the populations were equal. Instead, it reasoned that Brickerville's
        population is likely smaller than Tubac's known population of 1,191. The NO
        was based on a difference in values (Brickerville being smaller), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, Brickerville,
        PA is not more populous than Tubac, AZ." This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the populations were equal. Instead, it explicitly indicated that UCSB
        has a larger population ("the university is likely to have a larger population")
        and based its NO answer on this difference in size.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, La Homa,
        TX is not more populous than the University of California-Santa Barbara, CA."
        This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1a90aa19-f521-4f36-b66b-9a0c98d907ba:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but explicitly states
        different values (La Homa ~11,000 vs UCSB ~25,000) and indicates UCSB is larger.
        The NO is not due to equal values but due to UCSB having a larger population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, La Homa, TX is not
        more populous than the University of California, Santa Barbara, CA" as its
        final answer. This is a clear comparative NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - it explicitly notes that La Homa has around 11,000 people while UCSB's area
        has 15,000-20,000 people. The NO answer is given because UCSB's area has a
        larger population, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, La Homa, TX is not
        more populous than the University of California-Santa Barbara, CA area" as
        its final comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal.
        Instead, it explicitly noted different populations (a few thousand vs. over
        20,000) and gave NO because UCSB has a larger population than La Homa, not
        because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, La Homa,
        TX is not more populous than University of California-Santa Barbara, CA."
        This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that UCSB's population "is significantly larger
        than that of La Homa, TX." The NO answer is based on this difference in population,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, La Homa, TX is not
        more populous than the University of California, Santa Barbara, CA." This
        is a clear comparative NO answer.

    6ca8b39c-c0f3-4966-b2b7-eecacfc935b0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that UCSB's population (25,000+ including
        faculty/staff) is higher than La Homa's population (around 10,000)
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the answer to the question

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that UCSB's enrollment of 25,000 exceeds La
        Homa's population of 11,000-12,000. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, La Homa, TX is not
        more populous than University of California-Santa Barbara, CA" and provides
        specific population numbers showing UCSB (25,000) exceeds La Homa (11,000-12,000).

        Instead, it explicitly notes different values (La Homa: 11,000-12,000 vs UCSB:

    e0297c7d-bf76-45fb-8e59-e2dbf57ad021:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Isla Vista has a larger population
        (15,000-25,000) than La Homa (11,000-12,000). The NO is based on this difference
        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that La Homa, TX is not more populous than UC Santa Barbara
        (Isla Vista). The answer is given as a direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal.
        Instead, it explicitly noted that La Homa (11,000-12,000) is less populous
        than UCSB area (15,000-25,000), describing the latter as "significantly higher."
        The NO answer was based on this difference in populations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, La Homa,

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal. Instead, it gave NO because it reasoned that Belterra is likely larger
        due to its proximity to Austin. The model made a directional comparison, not
        an equality comparison.

        its conclusion - it actually suggests St. Charles might be "slightly larger."
      explanation_final_answer: While the model concludes with "the answer is likely
        NO", it heavily qualifies this with uncertainty and bases it on assumptions
        about "traditional population estimates". The response shows significant hedging
        and doesn't make a definitive comparison, instead discussing various possibilities.
        This indicates inability to make a clear determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that Boyden is likely larger than
        White Mills, giving a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
        The NO appears to be answering whether White Mills is more populous than Boyden,
        not indicating equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        after its analysis, making this a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

    ac5229f8-7ea4-4eb2-81ea-fdfeaffb9d14:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - in fact, it suggests Boyden (700-800 residents) is larger than White
        Mills (described as "generally smaller"). The NO answer is given because Boyden
        is described as more populous, not because the populations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Boyden, IA is not
        less populous than White Mills, PA" as its final comparative answer.

        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not applicable
        since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "So, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is not relevant
        since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model did not claim the populations were equal - it stated one location doesn't
        exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that Rouse, CA does not exist as
        a recognized location, making a true population comparison impossible. When
        a model rejects the premises of the question (in this case, the existence
        of one of the locations), the answer should be classified as UNKNOWN, even
        though the model stated "NO" as its conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, even if we had classified the final
        answer as NO, the model did not indicate the populations were equal - rather,
        it suggested one location may not exist as a recognized population center.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Rouse, CA is not
        more populous than Capitan, NM." However, it also indicates that Rouse, CA
        is not a widely recognized city/town and may not exist in major databases.
        Since the model is rejecting one of the premises of the comparison (the existence/recognition
        of Rouse), this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer must be False per the instructions. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model did not indicate the populations were equal
        - it suggested Rouse likely has a smaller population than Capitan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        regarding whether Rouse, CA is more populous than Capitan, NM. However, since
        the model indicates that Rouse, CA doesn't exist as a well-known city ("there
        is no well-known city named Rouse in California"), this effectively rejects
        the premise of the comparison. Per the instructions, when a model rejects
        the premises of the question, we should classify this as UNKNOWN.

        the populations were equal - it stated one location may not exist at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, it rejects one of the premises by stating "Rouse, CA does not appear
        to be a recognized city" and indicates it cannot make a proper comparison
        since one location may not exist. This makes it a case where the model rejects
        the premises of the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that Rouse either doesn't exist or
        has a very small population, while Capitan has a known small population. The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it expresses uncertainty about Rouse's existence, it still makes
        a comparative judgment about population sizes.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the populations
        were equal - it stated one location's population was unknown while the other
        had approximately 1,400 people.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Rouse, CA is not
        more populous than Capitan, NM." However, the model also indicates that Rouse,
        CA "does not appear to be a recognized city" and lacks population data. Since
        the model is rejecting one of the premises of the comparison (the existence/recognition
        of one location), this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the response never
        claimed the populations were equal - it stated that one location apparently
        doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because one location (Rouse, CA) doesn't appear to exist, making the
        comparison impossible. This is a case where the model rejects the premises
        of the question, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        were equal - it stated that one location doesn't exist and therefore no population
        comparison could be made.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given because one of the locations (Rouse, CA) does not appear
        to exist as a recognized city/town, making the comparison impossible. When

        no population to compare.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that Rouse, CA does not exist as
        a recognized place, making a true population comparison impossible. While
        the model says "NO", this is a case where it's rejecting the premise of the
        question since one location doesn't exist, rather than making a valid comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains a contradiction. While
        the analysis states "Bardmoor, FL has a larger population than White Horse,
        NJ", the final answer states "NO, Bardmoor, FL is more populous than White
        Horse, NJ." This appears to be a logical error in the conclusion, but we must
        classify based on the explicit final statement, which was "NO".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the populations are "quite
        close" and "around the 55,000 to 60,000 range," it explicitly states that
        Tinley Park "tends to have a slightly higher population than DeSoto." The
        NO answer is based on this difference in population, not on the populations
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, clearly indicating that Tinley Park is not less populous than DeSoto.
        The answer is definitive and includes the direction of the comparison (stating
        Tinley Park is more populous).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both cities have populations
        "in the same range," it explicitly states that Tinley Park "tends to have
        a slightly larger population." Since it identifies a difference (even if small),
        this is not a case where the NO answer was given because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Tinley Park, IL is
        not less populous than DeSoto, TX" as its final comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values question only applies when
        analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES, Tinley Park, IL is more populous than DeSoto, TX." This is
        a clear YES answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because DeSoto has
        a slightly higher population (56,766) than Tinley Park (55,971). The values
        are explicitly stated to be different, not equal, and this difference is the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that "Tinley Park, IL is not more populous than DeSoto,
        TX." This is a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model indicates that both cities have "similar
        population sizes" and gives the same range (55,000 to 60,000) for both cities.
        However, it doesn't explicitly state they are exactly equal, and the NO answer
        appears to be based on "approximate population estimates" rather than an explicit
        statement of equality being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model ultimately provides a clear "NO" answer
        in its final statement, even though it initially expresses some uncertainty.
        The final line explicitly states "NO, Tinley Park, IL is not more populous
        than DeSoto, TX based on approximate population estimates."

      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially notes both cities have populations
        in the "55,000-60,000" range, it specifically states that DeSoto has a "slightly
        higher population." Since it identifies a difference (even if small), this
        is not a case where the NO answer was given because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Tinley Park,
        IL is not more populous than DeSoto, TX" as a clear comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both locations have "similar
        population sizes," it explicitly states that "Coopertown, TN might have a
        slightly larger population." Since it indicates a difference (even if slight)
        rather than exact equality as the reason for the NO answer, this does not
        qualify as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, after analyzing the populations of both locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Coopertown's population is "typically
        higher than Armonk." Since it indicates a difference in values (not equality)
        as the reason for the NO answer, this does not qualify as a NO due to equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Armonk, NY is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal.
        Instead, it indicates Coopertown has a larger population (4,000-5,000) compared
        to Armonk (4,000), and explicitly states "Coopertown has had a larger population
        than Armonk." The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Armonk, NY is more populous than Coopertown, TN. This is a clear

        population compared to Coopertown." The NO answer was based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, Armonk, NY
        is not more populous than Coopertown, TN" after comparing the populations

        larger population (4,500-5,000) than Armonk (around 4,000), and this difference
        in values is the reason for the NO answer. The values are not described as
        being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Armonk, NY is not more

        that the populations were equal. Instead, it explicitly indicated that Coopertown
        is "typically larger than a hamlet like Armonk" and used this difference as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Coopertown "is generally larger
        than that of Armonk." The NO answer is given because Coopertown has a higher
        population, not because the populations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that Armonk has a smaller population
        than Coopertown (when considering Armonk alone, not as part of North Castle).
        The NO answer is based on a difference in population sizes, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" in bold,
        stating that Armonk is not more populous than Coopertown when considering
        Armonk alone. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a final answer of NO, it did
        not state that the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated that
        Troutman (3,800) has a different population than Mora (3,500) and concluded
        that "Troutman, NC is more populous than Mora, MN." The NO answer was not
        justified by equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though this seems inconsistent with its reasoning which found Troutman to
        be more populous. Despite this logical inconsistency, we must take the explicit
        "NO" answer at face value per the instructions.

        are equal. The model explicitly notes a difference in population sizes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, New Athens, IL is
        not more populous than South Zanesville, OH" as its final comparative answer,
        after determining South Zanesville has a higher population.

        NO), this must be False according to the criteria, regardless of the model
        noting both populations are "around 2,000".
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "the answer would lean towards
        NO" but expresses uncertainty about exact figures and suggests checking latest
        data. This hedging and lack of a definitive comparative conclusion makes this
        an UNKNOWN rather than a clear NO answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        "around 1,900" and are "very similar in size," and this equality is the primary
        reason given for the NO answer. The model does not indicate any difference
        between the populations, describing them as having the same approximate value.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different population
        values (1,800 vs 2,000) and concluded NO because South Zanesville is more
        populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different population values
        (60,000 vs 90,000) and indicates that "Plantation, FL has a larger population
        than Vineland, NJ." The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Vineland, NJ is more populous than Plantation, FL. This is a direct

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different population
        values (60,000 vs 90,000) and concluded NO because Plantation has a larger
        population than Vineland.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed different population
        values (Vineland ~60,000 vs Plantation ~95,000) and concluded NO because Plantation
        is more populous than Vineland.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, indicating that Vineland, NJ is not more

        population sizes" (40,000 to 45,000), it actually states that "Campbell, CA
        has slightly more residents than Mankato, MN" - indicating they are not exactly
        equal. Since it notes a difference (even if it seems to contradict its final
        conclusion), this cannot be classified as equal values being the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Campbell,

        but still concludes NO, indicating the equality of values is not the primary
        reason for the NO answer. The response appears somewhat contradictory, but
        we must evaluate based on what's explicitly stated rather than resolve contradictions.

        differences rather than stating they are exactly equal, and uses the phrase
        "not significantly more populous" rather than "equal," this indicates the
        NO is not based on exact equality.

        larger population than Moweaqua (1,800). The NO is based on this difference
        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically concluding that "Moweaqua, IL is not more populous than St. Bonifacius,
        MN." This is a direct comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expressed some uncertainty about exact
        numbers, it did not state the populations were equal. Instead, it concluded
        NO because it inferred Stottville (as a hamlet) was likely smaller than Yellville's
        known population of 1,200. The NO was based on an inferred difference, not
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both locations have populations
        "close to 2,500" and "neither stands out as definitively more populous." The
        NO answer is given because the populations are described as approximately
        equal. While the model mentions that "more precise data" might show slight
        differences, the primary reason for the NO is that the populations are described
        as being the same.

        populations (Hallowell ~2,500 and Blasdell ~2,500-3,000), the model explicitly
        states that Blasdell has a "slightly larger population." Since the model indicates
        a difference rather than equality, and this difference is the reason for the
        NO answer, this does not qualify as equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because Whidbey Island
        Station (2,051) has a greater population than La Villa (1,957), not because
        the values are equal. The model explicitly shows different values and states
        one is greater than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, La Villa, TX is not
        more populous than Whidbey Island Station, WA" after comparing specific population
        numbers. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model actually found different
        population values (3,500 vs under 2,000), not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is inconsistent. It first concludes
        that "Glennville, Georgia, is more populous than Mountain Green, Utah" but
        then gives a final answer of "NO". Since these statements contradict each
        other and there's no clear YES/NO comparative answer, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is contradictory - it states
        "NO" but then immediately follows with "Glennville, GA is more populous,"
        which would suggest "YES". Due to this direct contradiction, there is no clear
        YES/NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly indicates that Ralls has a larger population
        ("a few thousand residents" compared to Avila Beach's "less than 2,000").
        The NO answer is based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO. Avila
        Beach, CA, is not more populous than Ralls, TX." This is an explicit NO answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that Conyers (17,305) has a "slightly
        larger population" than Pinewood (17,246). Since it identifies a difference
        in values, even though small, this is not a case of equal values being the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Pinewood, FL is not
        more populous than Conyers, GA" as its final comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both cities have "similar
        population sizes" of "around 16,000 to 17,000 residents," it does not base
        its NO answer on them being exactly equal. Instead, it states that Conyers
        "tends to have a more stable and slightly higher population" as its reason
        for the NO answer. Since it indicates a difference (even if slight), this
        does not qualify as equal values being the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Pinewood,
        FL is not more populous than Conyers, GA." This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.

        it explicitly states that Conyers has a larger population (17,305) than Pinewood
        (16,523). The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on the
        values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically addressing whether Pinewood, FL is more populous than Conyers,
        GA. The answer is direct and comparative.

        equality as the basis for its NO answer. The model doesn't indicate any difference
        in population, only that they are the same size (around 3,000), making this
        equality the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (Cuthbert,
        GA is not definitively more populous than Chimayo, NM based on the available

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the populations were equal or the same. In fact, it suggested there was
        likely a difference in population sizes (with Effort being larger). The NO
        answer appears contradictory to the reasoning, but nowhere does it claim equal
        populations as the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        which directly contradicts its preceding statement that "Effort, PA is likely

        equal or the same. In fact, it suggests Thruston is likely smaller than Effort.
        The NO answer is based on other reasoning, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Effort, PA is not
        more populous than Thruston, KY" as its final answer. While the reasoning
        seems contradictory (saying NO while suggesting Thruston is smaller), we must
        take the explicit NO statement as the final answer.

        that the populations are equal or the same. Instead, it discussed relative
        population densities of the regions and suggested differences between them.
        The NO wasn't based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Effort, PA is more
        populous than Thruston, KY" as its final answer. While this seems to contradict
        the reasoning given (which suggests Effort might be larger), we must take
        the explicit NO statement at face value.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the populations were equal. In fact, it suggested differences in their
        sizes (describing Effort as having "a few thousand residents" and Thruston
        as "much smaller"). The NO answer appears to contradict the model's own analysis,
        but we must evaluate based on what was explicitly stated, not logical consistency.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. In fact, it suggests a difference in populations, stating that Kingwood
        has about 3,000 people while Baiting Hollow is "typically much smaller." The
        NO answer appears to be inconsistent with the model's own reasoning (which
        suggests Kingwood is larger), but we must evaluate only what was explicitly
        stated, not resolve contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Kingwood,
        WV is not more populous than Baiting Hollow, NY." This is a clear NO answer

        that the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated different values
        (3,000 vs less than 2,000) and concluded that Kingwood is more populous. The
        model gave no indication that equal values were the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though this appears to contradict its own analysis which showed Kingwood having
        a larger population. Despite this logical inconsistency, we must take the

        rather than a claim of equality. The phrase "similar" implies there are differences,
        even if small.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Alex, OK

        and are "in the range of a few hundred people," it does not explicitly state
        they are equal or identical, nor does it cite equality as the reason for its
        NO answer. The model simply concludes that Alex is not more populous than
        Randall without specifying the exact relationship between their populations.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different values (550 vs 650) and
        indicates that Randall is MORE populous than Alex. The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        The NO answer is based on this implied difference in populations, not on them
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While both cities are described as small and rural,
        the model explicitly states that "Wenona, IL, has a slightly higher population
        compared to Cornish, ME." Since the model indicates a difference in population
        (even if slight) rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer, this
        does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO. Cornish,
        ME is not more populous than Wenona, IL" after determining that Wenona has
        a slightly higher population. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Cornish "tends to have a slightly
        larger population than Wenona, IL" in step 4, though this seems to contradict
        its final NO answer. Despite this contradiction, we must evaluate based on
        what was stated, and the NO answer was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO. Cornish,
        ME is not more populous than Wenona, IL." This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.

        that the populations were equal. Instead, it suggested that County Center,
        VA likely has a higher population than Dorr, MI due to typical population
        trends. The NO wasn't based on equal values, but rather on County Center being
        more populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, County Center, VA

        vs 7,500) and indicates that Dorr, MI is more populous than County Center,
        VA.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that Dorr, MI is more populous

        Dorr (7,439) to be more populous than County Center (4,507). The values are
        different, not equal, and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, indicating that County Center, VA is not
        more populous than Dorr, MI. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        NO), this automatically results in False. While the model suggests the populations
        might be "somewhat comparable," this is irrelevant since we only evaluate
        equality as a reason for NO when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES/NO answer.
        While it speculates about a possible "NO," it explicitly states "it is not
        possible to definitively say 'YES' or 'NO'" and indicates it cannot make the
        comparison without precise population numbers. This uncertainty and inability
        to determine the answer classifies as UNKNOWN.

        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, County Center, VA

        - in fact, it explicitly states that Dorr, MI has a larger population (7,000)
        compared to County Center, VA (3,000). The NO answer is given because Dorr
        is larger, not because the values are equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        claimed the populations were equal - it simply stated it lacked the data to
        make a comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        say one is more populous than the other" and calls the answer "indeterminate
        without specific figures." This indicates it cannot make the comparison due
        to lack of data.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion "NO, Cascades, VA is more populous"
        is contradictory - the explanation suggests Cascades IS more populous, but

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly showed different population values (13,792
        vs 14,806) and concluded NO because Brookside has a larger population than
        East Cleveland.

        as part of its reasoning for the NO answer. Since there are differences in
        the ranges and other factors considered, this is not a case of equal values
        being the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO. East Cleveland, OH is not more populous than Brookside, DE."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Fort Stewart has
        a larger population (over 20,000) than Merrill (9,000-10,000). The NO is based
        on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Merrill, WI is not more
        populous than Fort Stewart, GA" as its final answer, making a direct comparative
        statement.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        population values (9,000 vs 30,000), not because the values were equal. It
        explicitly states Merrill "is less populous than" Fort Stewart area.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "the answer is: NO" after

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the populations were equal. Instead, it explicitly noted that Fort Stewart's
        population is "significantly larger" than Merrill's, with Fort Stewart having
        "tens of thousands" compared to Merrill's "9,000 to 10,000 residents". The
        NO was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically saying "Merrill, WI is not more populous than Fort Stewart, GA."
        This is a direct comparative answer.

        (Merrill ~9,000 vs Fort Stewart >10,000) and indicates Fort Stewart has a
        larger population. The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not
        on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Merrill, WI is not more

        "around 7,500 people," it explicitly notes that "Haddon Heights has a slightly
        higher population compared to Caribou." Since it indicates a difference (even
        if slight), this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO
        answer.

        explicitly states there is a difference ("Caribou, ME is slightly more populous")
        and this difference is the reason for the NO answer, not equality. Any difference,
        even if described as "slight," means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is NO"
        after determining that Caribou is slightly more populous than Haddon Heights.
        This is a clear NO comparative answer.

        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES, Haddon Heights,
        NJ is more populous than Caribou, ME." Despite noting similar populations
        earlier, it makes a clear final comparative judgment with YES.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model states both cities have "similar populations"
        of "approximately 7,500 residents," it also explicitly states that "Caribou,
        ME has a slightly smaller population." Since it indicates there is a difference
        (even if slight), this is not a case where equality is the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Haddon Heights, NJ
        is not more populous than Caribou, ME" as its final answer, even though it
        seems to contradict itself by saying Caribou has a "slightly smaller population."
        Since there is an explicit NO statement as the comparative result, we classify
        this as NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer.
        While it suggests Green, OH is "not significantly more populous," this is

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the populations are "similar"
        and "close enough," it does not explicitly state they are exactly equal or
        identical. In fact, it suggests they are "very close" but still different.
        The NO answer is not based on the cities having equal populations, but rather
        appears to be stating that one is not greater than the other (though the response
        is somewhat contradictory about which one).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Green, OH is not
        more populous than Prior Lake, MN" as its final answer, even though this seems
        to contradict its earlier statement about Green historically being slightly
        more populous. Since we must take the explicit final NO statement at face

        state they are exactly equal. The NO answer appears to be based on the inability
        to determine a clear advantage rather than on exact equality. The model specifically
        mentions "slight differences in estimates" could exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is
        NO" regarding whether Green, OH is more populous than Prior Lake, MN. While
        it discusses uncertainty in the data, it still provides a clear NO answer
        rather than refusing to answer.

        the model indicates the cities have similar but not exactly equal populations
        ("might vary slightly"), so it would still be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO, there is no clear indication
        that Green, OH is more populous than Prior Lake, MN based on the available
        data." Since this NO is due to inability to determine the comparison rather
        than a definitive comparative result, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model indicates that Taylor, MI has a slightly
        higher population (63,000) than Hamilton, OH (62,000). The NO answer is based
        on this difference in values, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Hamilton, OH is not
        more populous than Taylor, MI" as its final comparative answer, providing
        a clear NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        population values (under 40,000 vs over 100,000) and explicitly states Davenport
        is larger. The NO is not due to equal values, but rather due to finding Davenport
        is more populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Myrtle
        Beach, SC is not more populous than Davenport, IA" as its final answer. This
        is a direct comparative NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Davenport (100,000)
        is "significantly more populous" than Myrtle Beach (35,000-40,000), showing
        a clear difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Myrtle Beach, SC

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population values (35,000-40,000
        vs 100,000), it does not indicate the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly
        states Davenport has a larger population, making this a NO based on difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Myrtle Beach, SC is

        is based on Davenport being larger, not on the cities having equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Myrtle Beach, SC
        is not more populous than Davenport, IA" as its final answer. This is a clear
        comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in population (Myrtle Beach ~35,000-40,000 vs Davenport ~100,000) and describes
        this as "significantly larger." The NO is based on this difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that "Myrtle Beach, SC is not more populous than Davenport,
        IA." This is a direct comparative answer.

        (which includes Ridgebury), describing a difference in population sizes rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the populations were equal - it actually discussed uncertainty about the relative
        sizes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately qualifies
        it with uncertainty and assumptions, indicating it cannot make a definitive
        comparison due to lack of specific data for Ridgebury. The response shows
        the model is unable to determine the actual comparison, making this an UNKNOWN
        rather than a clear NO.

        Experiment, GA ("likely more suburban and possibly more populous"). The NO
        answer is based on Ridgebury being larger, not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Experiment,

        MORE populous than Experiment, GA (which it estimated at 2,000-3,000 people).
        The NO answer was based on this difference in populations, not on them being

        difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, Experiment,

        itself with the NO answer. Since it indicates a difference (even if slight)
        rather than equality as the basis for comparison, this doesn't qualify as
        a NO due to equal values.

        that the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly showed different population
        values (10,121 vs 9,072) and did not mention equality as the reason for its
        NO answer. Even though there appears to be a logical error in the conclusion,
        we must evaluate based on what was explicitly stated.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains an apparent contradiction.
        While the data presented shows Harrisonville is more populous (10,121 > 9,072),
        the model explicitly states "NO, Harrisonville, MO is more populous than Blacklick
        Estates, OH." Since we must take the explicit NO statement at face value regardless
        of the logical contradiction, and it's a clear comparative answer, the final

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but explicitly states
        different population values (Hailey ~8,000 vs Rolesville ~9,475) and indicates
        Rolesville is more populous. The NO is not due to equal values but due to
        Rolesville being larger.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Hailey, ID is not

        rather than equality. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on the
        populations being equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different population values (Hailey
        ~8,000 vs Rolesville ~10,000-12,000) and indicates Rolesville is more populous
        than Hailey. The NO is based on this difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Hailey, ID is not more
        populous than Rolesville, NC" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO

      explanation_equal_values: While the model provides population numbers for both
        cities (8,000 vs 9,000), it does not state that they are equal. In fact, it
        explicitly notes a difference in population (Hailey with 8,000 and Rolesville
        with "over 9,000"). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Hailey,

        the other." While this suggests similarity, the model notes that numbers can
        "vary slightly" and doesn't explicitly state they are exactly equal. The NO
        answer appears to be based on lack of clear evidence of Linton being larger,
        not on exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        states that "Iowa Falls tends to have a slightly larger population than Linton."
        This tiny difference, rather than exact equality, is the basis for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Linton, IN

        about exact numbers rather than an observed difference. The primary reason
        for the NO is that they have "similar population sizes" and are "roughly equivalent."

        that Linton "tends to have a slightly smaller population than Iowa Falls",
        indicating a difference rather than equality. This difference, not equality,
        is the reason for the NO answer.

        that "Linton, IN is slightly more populous than Iowa Falls, IA", indicating
        there is a difference (even if small). This contradiction in the response
        doesn't affect our classification - since a difference is stated, we cannot
        classify this as equal values being the reason for the NO answer.

        than Linton, IN". The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Willis, TX
        is not less populous than Bangor Base, WA" as a clear comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it suggests there are differences, noting that
        Willis "might be marginally larger" than Bangor Base. Even though it concludes
        with NO, this NO is not based on equal values but rather on some other reasoning
        (which appears somewhat inconsistent with its earlier statements).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it suggests Willis is "likely to have a larger
        or comparable population" and bases its NO answer on uncertainty due to Bangor
        Base's "transient nature." The NO is not based on equal values but rather
        on inability to make a definitive comparison due to the military base's variable
        population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Willis, TX is not
        definitively more populous than Bangor Base, WA" as its final answer. While
        there is some uncertainty in the reasoning, the model does provide a clear
        NO as its comparative conclusion.

        there was a difference in population (6,400 vs 7,400) and did not indicate
        the values were equal. In fact, it specifically noted that "Bangor Base, WA
        is more populous than Willis, TX."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations of the two locations, where it found Bangor
        Base (7,400) to be more populous than Willis (6,400).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer while actually suggesting
        Willis, TX is likely MORE populous than Bangor Base, WA ("Willis, TX, as a
        city, is more likely to have a stable residential population compared to a
        military base"). This appears to be logically inconsistent with the NO answer,
        but we must evaluate based on what was stated, not logical consistency.

        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, making this a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.'

        equal or the same. Instead, it makes a comparative judgment based on reasoning
        about typical sizes, suggesting Bangor Base would have a larger population.
        The NO answer is not due to equal values but rather due to the model's belief
        that one is larger than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Willis, TX
        is not more populous than Bangor Base, WA" as a direct comparative statement.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not relevant since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is **YES**" after reasoning that Willis, TX likely has a larger population
        than Bangor Base, WA.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the populations are equal. In fact, it suggests Willis has about 6,000
        people while Bangor Base has "several thousand but typically less than or
        around that number." Since it indicates a difference in populations (even
        if its conclusion seems inconsistent with its reasoning), this does not qualify
        as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, making this a clear NO response. While this seems to contradict its
        reasoning (which suggests Willis is more populous), we must evaluate based
        on the explicit final answer given.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a clear NO answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different population values
        (75,000 vs 110,000) and indicates Greeley is more populous than Racine.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Racine, WI, is not

        in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Racine is more populous than Greeley, and provides a direct comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes different population values (5,000 vs 5,700)
        and states that Sharon Hill is more populous. The NO answer is given because
        Sharon Hill has a larger population, not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that Sharon Hill (5,700)
        has a larger population than Indian Hills (5,000), and this difference was
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal.
        Instead, it suggests Fort Montgomery "tends to be smaller than" Roaming Shores,
        indicating a difference in population. While exact numbers aren't given, the
        model indicates a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Fort Montgomery,

        equal. In fact, it suggests there are differences in population, indicating
        that Gantt, SC likely has a higher population than Bradley Gardens, NJ (contradicting
        its earlier suggestion about NJ being more densely populated). The NO answer
        is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Bradley Gardens,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. While the model did note
        equal populations of 14,000, this is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality
        as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO, we cannot conclusively
        say..." which indicates inability to determine rather than a comparative result.
        This is a case where the model is expressing uncertainty about making the
        comparison, making it an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model found different population values (5,000
        vs 5,500) and based its NO answer on Anamosa being larger, not on the values
        being equal. The populations are explicitly stated to be different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, indicating that La Crescent, MN is not more
        populous than Anamosa, IA.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7d8fdaa0-0ee0-435e-962d-005bef0dab48:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model indicates that both cities have "similar"
        populations and "might overlap," but it doesn't explicitly state they are
        exactly equal. Instead, it gives ranges (5,000-6,000 vs 5,500-6,000) that
        overlap but aren't identical. The NO answer appears to be based on the lack
        of clear difference rather than explicit equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the populations of both cities.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b300bd3a-e297-4659-bce2-7216eb38dbf3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model clearly states different population values
        (5,000 vs 5,500) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer,
        not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, La Crescent, MN is
        not more populous than Anamosa, IA" as its final comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b9ad3936-fd15-4fd8-8b58-352db99dc54e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model provides specific population numbers,
        it indicates that Anamosa (5,494) has a greater population than La Crescent
        (5,276). The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on the values
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that La Crescent is not more populous than Anamosa,
        providing specific population numbers to support this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bd35a508-ec81-4e91-a26d-e5f19ff1b13d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives different values for the populations
        (5,000 vs 5,500) and does not state they are equal/same/identical. The NO
        answer is based on La Crescent having a smaller population, not because the
        values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the populations of both cities (5,000 vs 5,500)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e4942937-428a-4fcb-8a3c-4ac8630a60ce:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly notes different values (5,000 vs 5,500 residents)
        and uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is based on
        Anamosa being larger, not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, where the question was whether La Crescent
        is more populous than Anamosa. The answer is clear and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
