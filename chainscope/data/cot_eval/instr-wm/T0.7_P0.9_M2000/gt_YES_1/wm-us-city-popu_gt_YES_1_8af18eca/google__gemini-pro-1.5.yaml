      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal. Instead, it indicated that Brickerville's population is "highly unlikely"
        to exceed Tubac's (implying a difference), and noted that one population isn't
        even officially counted while the other is around 1,000. The NO answer was
        based on this likely difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Brickerville's
        population does not exceed Tubac's.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    04291929-e514-4210-9b77-c7e1242fb38f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly noted a difference, suggesting Tubac has thousands
        of residents while Brickerville is described as "quite small, possibly in
        the hundreds." The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the populations of both places, indicating
        Brickerville does not have a larger population than Tubac.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    193b7c1a-33e8-40bc-b68d-933fb3fad7a5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal. Instead, it indicated that Brickerville's population (though uncertain)
        would be unlikely to be more populous than Tubac. The NO answer was based
        on this comparative reasoning, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it acknowledged uncertainty about Brickerville's
        exact population.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is YES" as
        its final conclusion after comparing the populations
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    9c8af0de-bfe5-4273-ac45-8c6881e1daba:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - in fact, it suggested Tubac has "at least 1,000 residents" while Brickerville
        was estimated at "likely under 1,000". The NO answer was based on Brickerville
        not being more populous than Tubac, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the populations of both locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a8915037-4e63-4a16-b4b4-7cd5d5b3c2ff:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal. Instead, it indicated that Brickerville's population is likely smaller
        than Tubac's ("highly unlikely that a small, unincorporated community has
        a larger population than a CDP of 1,000+ people"). The NO answer was based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that Brickerville does not have a larger population
        than Tubac.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c3eef7c1-6858-48e2-94e6-e616b133461e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - instead, it suggested Brickerville is "almost certainly larger" than Tubac.
        The NO answer was based on this difference in size, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that Tubac is not larger than Brickerville
        (in fact, suggesting the opposite)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    dc94bb13-7a54-461b-a73d-7f89a4e77235:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (1,300 vs 1,200), not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the populations and determining that 1,300 > 1,200
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    f0a69422-54be-44f8-9ecc-53503d6b1c3d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the populations
        were equal. Instead, it gave NO after reasoning that Tubac likely has a larger
        population than Brickerville, with one place having an official count and
        the other not having separate population figures.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, where it determined that
        Tubac likely has a larger population than Brickerville.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Santa Barbara's population is "much greater
        than" La Loma's population of 200. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final comparative conclusion after analyzing the populations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    34569021-851a-4a75-b818-9c6a85fa4197:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step reasoning about comparing the populations of La Homa/La Loma
        and UCSB.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    6bcf163f-c8d9-4769-9136-96e3d256dce8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly noted a difference in scale ("hundreds" vs "tens
        of thousands"). The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as its final comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    75143dcd-da4f-4a44-a232-8da9cd159135:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is likely YES" as its final comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    a35ab6c4-d7f7-4d88-aa00-91058dea67a1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values criterion only applies when
        analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        after its step-by-step reasoning'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    a4532956-baf4-4f94-b144-02705296e75a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal or the same. Instead, it indicated there was a difference, suggesting
        that UCSB likely has a larger population than La Homa. The NO answer appears
        to be based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to verify or rejection
        of premises.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b4ef91c8-07ec-4ca0-acb3-c3d50ce3f067:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explains that the comparison is inappropriate
        and cannot be answered with a yes/no because one is a neighborhood within
        a city and the other is a university. It explicitly states "the question is
        flawed and cannot be answered with a simple yes or no." This is a rejection
        of the premises of the question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    c1b710e1-f8bc-4a66-89e1-87997a13e498:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premises of the question by
        stating "Neither location is a city" and explicitly says it "cannot be answered
        with a simple yes or no." This is a case where the model rejects the premises
        of the question, making it an UNKNOWN response.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its step-by-step reasoning
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    e9d80398-5008-41f0-a77d-01c23e374f3e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question is flawed
        and cannot be answered with a YES/NO" and explains that it's comparing incompatible
        entities. This is a clear rejection of the premises of the question rather
        than a refusal to answer or a direct YES/NO comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model clearly shows
        different values (7,500 vs 10,000) and indicates Belterra's population is
        higher. The NO is not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after showing that Belterra (10,000) has a larger population than Baldwinsville
        (7,500)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that the populations are
        different (7,500 vs 10,000) and indicates that one is less than the other.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that 7,500 is less than 10,000.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model clearly showed
        different values (7,500 vs 13,000) and did not state they were equal. In fact,
        it explicitly showed they were different using the < symbol.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly showed they were different (7,500 vs 10,000+) and used
        this difference as the basis for its NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after showing that Baldwinsville's population (7,500) is less than

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 7,500 is less than
        10,000, indicating a difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing

        The NO answer was based on this difference in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly laid out its reasoning and explicitly
        stated "NO" as its final answer when comparing if Casas Adobes has a larger
        population than St. Charles. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the populations are "very
        close" and "very similar," it does not explicitly state they are exactly equal.
        In fact, it indicates that more precise figures would be needed for a definitive
        comparison, suggesting some uncertainty about their exact relationship. The
        NO answer appears to be based on the model's assessment that it's "unlikely"
        one is more populous than the other, not because they are explicitly stated
        to be equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        regarding whether Casas Adobes is more populous than St. Charles. While it
        notes uncertainty about precise figures, it provides a clear NO as its comparative
        conclusion.

        NM. The model never stated the populations were equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that Rouse, CA is not larger than Capitan,
        NM. While the model notes uncertainty about exact figures, it provides a definitive
        NO answer based on its reasoning.

        equal or the same. Instead, it indicated that Rouse, CA is likely smaller
        than Capitan, NM, describing it as "highly unlikely a small, unincorporated
        community would have a larger population than a town of 1,500." The NO answer
        was based on this difference in size, not on equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that a direct population comparison is not possible. Since
        this "NO" indicates an inability to make the comparison rather than a comparative
        result, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO", the entire explanation
        leading up to it explains why it cannot make the comparison, stating "we cannot
        definitively answer the question" due to lack of data and comparing non-equivalent
        entities. This makes it a case where the model is rejecting its ability to
        determine the answer rather than making a comparative conclusion.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer to the *specific* question asked" and explains that it's "impossible
        to determine if Bardmoor is more populous than White Horse." This indicates
        the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of specific data for these
        unincorporated communities.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal or the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer based on reasoning that one
        location (Walton Park) is a hamlet without separate population figures and
        would likely be smaller than Fort Defiance. Since the NO was not based on
        equal values, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it acknowledged uncertainty about one of the
        populations. Since it provided a clear NO answer (not saying it cannot determine
        or verify), this should be classified as NO.

        NO was not due to equal values, but rather due to a clear difference in population
        sizes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing

        doesn't have its own population figure, making comparison impossible. This
        is a different reason than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - it actually specifies different values (Slippery Rock ~3,600 vs Bluewell
        under 1,000). While it gives a NO answer, it's not because the values are
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Slippery Rock borough (>3,000) has
        a different and larger population than Bluewell (<1,000). The NO answer was
        based on this difference in populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Slippery Rock borough has a larger population than Bluewell, making this
        a clear comparative answer.

        - in fact, it explicitly notes that Slippery Rock has "a few thousand" residents
        while Bluewell has "hundreds," indicating a clear difference in population
        sizes. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, indicating Bluewell does not have a larger
        population than Slippery Rock.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly reasons that one (the town) is likely larger
        than the other (the university). The NO answer is based on this expected difference
        in populations, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        making a clear comparative judgment based on its reasoning about comparing
        a university population vs. a whole town's population.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO without that data" and only makes assumptions without giving
        a clear YES/NO answer. This indicates inability to make a definitive comparison.

        population sizes ("a few hundred" vs "a few thousand") and this difference
        is the reason for the NO answer, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that they are different types of entities (city vs university) and cities
        generally have larger populations than universities.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result based on the reasoning
        that cities generally have larger populations than universities.

        the populations were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Slippery Rock
        University likely has a larger population ("highly likely Slippery Rock University
        has a larger resident population than the town of Bluewell"), indicating a
        difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, not as a refusal or inability to determine. The model
        provided reasoning and reached this conclusion based on population comparisons.

        larger population than Bluewell (600). The values are clearly different, not
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

        since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing

        False according to the criteria. The actual comparison showing similar or
        slightly different values is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality as
        a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its step-by-step analysis, making this a clear YES answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values are equal. Rather, the model explains it cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of population data for one location. The model never states or
        implies the populations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it explains it cannot make a definitive comparison due to lack of data
        for Alleghenyville, the model still provides a clear "NO" answer rather than
        refusing to answer or stating it cannot determine.

    63d21b62-d58a-4794-9e39-1e4b27016b70:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal. Instead, it indicated that Alleghenyville doesn't have independent
        population figures and used this, along with it being part of a larger township,
        to conclude it cannot be more populous than Union Bridge. The NO answer was
        based on this reasoning, not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that Alleghenyville is not more populous than
        Union Bridge. This was a clear NO answer based on the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        the populations were equal - it stated it couldn''t determine the populations
        to compare them.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot compare the populations
        since Alleghenyville doesn't have its own population figures, but then gives
        "NO" as its final answer. Since the model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        but still provides a "NO", this should be classified as UNKNOWN per the criteria
        that states we should use UNKNOWN when "The model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - rather, it indicates that one place doesn't have its own population
        figure while the other has approximately 1,000 people. The NO answer is based
        on the inability of Alleghenyville to be larger than Union Bridge, not because
        the values are equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result (concluding that Alleghenyville
        cannot be more populous than Union Bridge)

    ac6a0bec-9416-461c-bd45-d86036796c91:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it indicates that one area (Brecknock Township) is likely
        larger than Union Bridge, and even suggests that Alleghenyville itself can't
        be directly compared since it lacks its own population figures. The NO answer
        appears to be based on inability to make a direct comparison of Alleghenyville's
        population, not because of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, making this a clear NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal. Instead, it indicated that Alleghenyville likely has a smaller population
        than Union Bridge's 1,000 people, making a directional comparison. The NO
        answer was based on this difference in populations, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Alleghenyville does not have a larger
        population than Union Bridge.

    e9bdcf86-cd24-49f1-a6e0-47442ed21ee8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        populations were equal - it stated one population figure wasn't available
        for comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because the question as posed
        is unanswerable)" and explains that one location doesn't have separate population
        figures, making comparison impossible. This is a case where the model rejects
        the premises of the question, making it an UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative
        result.

      result: UNKNOWN
    f64dbf16-fd0b-4772-85f6-3dd613d5feda:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it believes Alleghenyville
        (being an unincorporated part of a township) would likely have a smaller population
        than Union Bridge. The reasoning is based on a difference in populations,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its comparative
        answer, providing a clear reasoning that Alleghenyville (as part of Brecknock
        Township) is unlikely to be more populous than Union Bridge, MD.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f7de666e-996d-46c8-ad54-d87e9f8999bf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal.
        Instead, it indicated that one place (Alleghenyville) is "highly unlikely"
        to be more populous than Union Bridge's 1,000 people. The NO answer was based
        on this comparative difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a comparative
        answer after reasoning about the populations, indicating Alleghenyville is
        not more populous than Union Bridge.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fb3f5f13-3fbc-4427-9373-c41fb7bd00c5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explains that one value (Alleghenyville) cannot be determined
        while the other (Union Bridge) has a known value around 1,000. The NO answer
        is based on inability to make the comparison, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative conclusion rather than a statement
        about inability to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations are equal
        - instead, it explained that Grovetown "almost certainly has a larger" population
        due to differences in how military vs civilian populations are counted. The
        NO answer was based on this difference in populations, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its reasoning steps.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal or the same. Instead, it discussed how the populations are counted differently
        (military installation vs. incorporated city) and suggested Grovetown's population
        would encompass a broader area. The NO answer appears to be based on these
        differences in classification and measurement rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify
        the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4997ff3e-472c-44d9-9147-0db44cae99cf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal or the same. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined Grovetown
        "likely has a larger official population count than Fort Leonard Wood." The
        reasoning was based on a difference (Grovetown being larger), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer after its analysis comparing the populations. The answer was clear
        and definitive, not indicating inability to determine or rejection of premises.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    72c1bfaa-598d-416d-9b30-4dadabea40d8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the populations were equal - it stated the comparison itself was not meaningful
        due to different types of population measures.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately qualifies
        it by saying the question is flawed and cannot be directly answered. This
        indicates the model is rejecting the premises of the question and stating
        it cannot make the comparison, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    936884fb-74d6-498a-b840-1f1f3a0bb361:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the populations
        being equal. Instead, it argues that the comparison is invalid because Fort
        Leonard Wood isn't a city in the same sense as Grovetown, making their populations
        incomparable. The model never states that their populations are equal or the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative result based on its analysis that the
        populations cannot be meaningfully compared due to their different administrative
        classifications.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    af32e119-b522-4ff7-a3cd-76e700562c32:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the populations
        being equal. Instead, it states that Fort Leonard Wood doesn't have a separate
        population figure and therefore "cannot be larger than Grovetown's." This
        is a different type of reasoning than saying the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it explains that Fort Leonard Wood doesn't have a separate population
        figure, it still provides a clear NO as its comparative conclusion rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bbb57a70-dc31-4f62-99b9-29a217f46681:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values classification
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is likely YES" - while there was some uncertainty indicated by "likely",
        the model did provide a clear YES answer.

    bf306130-eb2f-4154-aaa1-09b060512165:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it argues that the comparison is invalid because
        one is a military base and the other is an incorporated city, making it "not
        a like-for-like comparison." Even when it mentions "Even if the number of
        people present at Fort Leonard Wood at any given time is higher," it's giving
        a different reason for the NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO." The NO is given as a direct comparative result, not as an inability
        to determine or verify. While the model explains why the comparison may not
        be appropriate, it still provides a clear NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    dd053c73-c0c5-4674-9a6b-59357fc03a20:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the numbers are "close" (around
        15,000 for both), it explicitly states that Grovetown has a "slightly larger
        population." Since there is a stated difference, even if small, this is not
        a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations, making a clear comparative statement that Grovetown appears
        to have a slightly larger population.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ec4125b9-f377-4711-ac09-dc0665e5311c:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model did not give a NO answer
        based on equal values - it actually refused to make the direct comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model indicates that a proper comparison cannot
        be made due to different population types (military vs civilian) and lack
        of reliable data. While it mentions "almost certainly NO" for civilian population
        comparison, this is presented as a hypothetical alternative question, not
        an answer to the original comparison. The response essentially refuses to
        make the requested comparison due to incompatible metrics.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN

        indicate equal values - it stated that a comparison was impossible due to
        one location not being properly defined.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO.", the reasoning provided
        indicates it cannot make the comparison because one location is not a defined
        area. This is effectively rejecting the premise of the question, making it
        an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparison.

        people) was "very likely larger than" County Center, VA. This indicates a
        difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        "the question cannot be answered as written" because one location isn't defined

        give a NO answer at all, so we don't need to evaluate whether equal values
        were involved.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer" and explains that a direct comparison isn't possible due to lack
        of defined population data for Lake Norman of Catawba. This is a clear refusal
        to make the comparison.

        claimed the populations were equal - it stated that one location doesn't have
        a definable population figure.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does say "NO", it immediately clarifies
        that it's impossible to answer the question. This effectively rejects the
        premise of the comparison since one location doesn't have a defined population.
        Per the guidelines, when a model rejects the premises or indicates it cannot
        make the comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        exist at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot make the comparison because one location
        doesn't have population data ("a direct comparison is impossible"). This is
        a case where the model rejects the premises of the question by stating one
        of the values doesn't exist, making it impossible to compare.

        were equal - it stated that one location's population couldn't be properly
        determined for comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, but rejects
        the premise by explaining that Lake Norman of Catawba isn't a place with a
        directly comparable population and calls the question flawed. When a model
        rejects the premises of the question, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't access the
        necessary population data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer without access to population data" and indicates it cannot make a definitive
        comparison due to lack of data. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot determine the answer.

        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the populations
        were equal - it stated that one population value doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but also indicates that "a direct comparison is impossible" because one of
        the areas (Lake Norman of Catawba) doesn't have a defined population. Since
        the model rejects the premises of the question by stating one value doesn't

        model never claimed the populations were equal - it stated it couldn't make
        the comparison due to definition/boundary issues.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (due to inability to make a meaningful
        comparison)" which indicates it cannot determine the comparison. Since the
        NO is qualified with an inability to compare rather than a direct comparative
        result, this falls under the UNKNOWN category per the criteria.

    f60ff076-a943-4b09-a267-2be2bb7544a6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values being compared are equal. Instead, the model explains that one
        location (Lake Norman of Catawba) doesn't have a population figure in the
        same way as the other location, making comparison impossible. The NO is based
        on incomparability rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it explains that a direct comparison isn't possible because one location
        doesn't have a population in the same way, it still provides a clear "NO"
        answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        Brookside has a larger population. The NO was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (13,000-14,000 vs 1,500-1,600) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the populations and finding East Cleveland's population to be greater than

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly stated there was a difference
        in values (13,700 vs 15,000) and indicated that East Cleveland is less than
        Brookside. The NO answer was not due to equal values, but due to a clear difference
        between the populations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "the populations
        are approximately the same" and uses this equality as the primary reason for
        concluding NO (that Nebraska City is not more populous). The mention of a
        "slight difference" is presented as uncertainty in sources rather than a confirmed
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        there was a difference in values (7,000 vs 7,500) and did not indicate equality
        was the reason for the NO. The NO appears to be based on finding Nebraska
        City's population to be less than Keyport's.

        the populations are different (6,300 vs 10,800) and even used the < symbol
        to indicate Nebraska City has a smaller population than Keyport. The NO was
        not based on equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        this is "because the comparison is flawed, not because Merrill is smaller."
        The NO is not based on the values being equal - in fact, the model suggests
        they are different (noting that "a city generally has a larger resident population
        than a military base"). The reason given is the incomparability of the entities,
        not their equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it explains this is due to the comparison being flawed, it still
        provides NO as a definitive comparative response. The parenthetical clarification
        reinforces that this is meant as a direct NO answer rather than a rejection
        of the ability to compare.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values being compared are equal. Instead, the NO was given because the
        model rejected the validity of comparing a city population to a military base
        population. The model never states that the values are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with the reasoning that the comparison is flawed due to Fort Stewart being
        a military base rather than a city. While it mentions that a different interpretation
        might yield "YES", it clearly states that "as phrased... the best answer is
        NO".

        Instead, it reasoned that Fort Stewart likely has more residents than Merrill,
        WI (indicating a difference in values), and gave NO as its answer based on
        this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        populations were equal - it stated the comparison couldn't be made because
        Fort Stewart isn't a city.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that Fort Stewart is not a city and
        therefore cannot be meaningfully compared, rejecting the premise of the comparison.
        While it says "NO" at the end, this is effectively stating it cannot determine
        the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN response.

        NO answer appears to be based on this incomparability rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result based on its analysis of
        the populations, not a rejection of ability to compare or premises.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal - in fact, it explicitly reasoned that Ridgebury likely has more residents
        than Experiment, indicating a difference in population. The NO answer appears
        to be based on this difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after reasoning about the relative populations of the two
        locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4c3548e0-ca43-48c9-a8ac-1bd1dc415096:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly stated that Experiment, GA "appears to be significantly
        smaller" than Ridgebury, CT. The NO answer was based on this difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the populations, without caveats about
        inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5a3be544-0fdf-4d43-86b7-29a50cfa2d7d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - in fact, it suggested Ridgebury likely has a larger population than Experiment.
        The NO answer appears to be based on this perceived difference in population
        sizes, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without qualifying it as inability to determine or verify.
        While noting uncertainty in exact numbers, it made a comparative judgment.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    66a9774a-4068-43db-826a-8b9eae8e9c68:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted both places are small, it did
        not state they have equal populations. Instead, it suggested Ridgebury likely
        has more residents than Experiment ("suggesting it might have some more residents
        than Experiment"), making this a comparison of different values rather than
        equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to whether Experiment, GA is more populous than Ridgebury, CT. This
        was a clear comparative conclusion, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly stated
        there was a difference in values (0 vs. some number greater than 0) rather
        than stating they were equal. The NO appears to indicate that Experiment is
        not greater than Ridgebury, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations, making a clear comparative statement that Experiment's population
        (0) is less than Ridgebury's (>0)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal. Instead, it indicated that Ridgebury, CT likely has a larger population
        than Experiment, GA (described as a "near-ghost town"). The NO answer was
        based on this difference in populations, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Experiment, GA does not have a larger
        population than Ridgebury, CT.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d0cee430-9126-4cfa-8ff9-617516cb80f7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Ridgebury has a larger population
        ("it's clear that Ridgebury, CT, has a larger population")
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations and determining that Ridgebury has a larger population than
        Experiment

    fad98483-2505-4145-a993-7451864dc3c5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates both places are small, it
        does not explicitly state they have equal populations. In fact, it emphasizes
        that numerical data is unavailable and "a definitive answer is impossible."
        The NO answer appears to be due to lack of evidence rather than proven equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a statement
        about inability to determine or rejection of premises.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "the populations
        are roughly equal" and uses this equality as the primary reason for its NO
        answer. The model mentions that sources might list "slightly different numbers"
        but attributes this to different survey years rather than an actual population
        difference, and emphasizes that "the figures are very close."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining Refugio is not more populous

        it indicates there might be slight differences ("some sources suggest Refugio
        is slightly larger") but expresses uncertainty about the precise comparison
        due to margins of error. Since it doesn't explicitly state equality as the
        reason for the NO answer, this doesn't meet the criteria for True.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values are equal.
        Instead, it concluded NO because it determined Walla Walla East would have
        a larger population than Tracy City's 1,500 people. The model explicitly states
        there is a difference in populations, with Walla Walla East being more populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Tracy
        City's population is not greater than Walla Walla East's population.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the populations were equal. Instead, it reasoned that Tracy City must be more
        populous than any part of Walla Walla since Walla Walla East is not a separate
        city. The NO was based on a difference in populations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its reasoning steps, indicating Tracy City is not
        less populous than Walla Walla East.

        it explicitly showed they were different using the < symbol.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the populations were equal. Instead, it indicated that Walla Walla East
        is "highly likely to have a larger population than Tracy City." The NO answer
        was based on a difference in populations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its reasoning steps, indicating that Tracy City does
        not have a larger population than Walla Walla East.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it indicates that Walla Walla East doesn't have separate population
        data as it's part of larger Walla Walla, while Tracy City has around 1,500
        people. The NO answer is based on the inability of Walla Walla East to be
        more populous, not because the populations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, making a clear comparative judgment that
        Walla Walla East is not more populous than Tracy City.

        Instead, it gave a NO answer based on reasoning that Walla Walla East, being
        part of a larger city, would likely have a larger population than Tracy City's
        1,500 people.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that Walla
        Walla East is not an independent city and therefore can't be more populous
        than Tracy City. The NO is based on inability to make a proper comparison,
        not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the populations
        being equal. Instead, it suggests Willis, TX has a larger civilian population
        than the base, indicating a difference in populations. The model's NO answer
        appears to be addressing whether Bangor Base has a larger population than
        Willis (not whether they're equal).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it notes the question is flawed. While it expresses concerns about
        the comparison, it still provides a definitive NO answer regarding the population
        comparison.

        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The model didn't give a
        NO answer due to equal values, but rather because one of the locations wasn't
        a valid city for comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but rejects the premise by stating that Bangor Base isn't a city and therefore
        can't be compared population-wise. When a model rejects the premises of the
        comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        NO" as its final conclusion, even though it expresses some uncertainty about
        precise numbers. Since it provides a clear NO as its comparative result, this
        should be classified as NO rather than REFUSED or UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis. While the model expressed
        uncertainty about exact numbers, it provided a definitive NO answer based
        on its reasoning about population counting methods.

    c5bc1e41-edf3-4aba-9fd3-0169927a3ec0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that Aberdeen Proving Ground's population
        is "unlikely to exceed" Paramount-Long Meadow's population, suggesting a difference
        rather than equality. The NO appears to be based on this comparative difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after comparing the populations, making this a clear NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal.
        Instead, it indicated that Paramount-Long Meadow has around 3,000 people while
        Aberdeen Proving Ground likely has a smaller population. The NO answer was
        based on this difference in populations, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Aberdeen
        Proving Ground is not more populous than Paramount-Long Meadow.

        has a smaller resident population" than the CDP, indicating a difference in
        values as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify
        the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly stated that the populations are
        different (5,000 vs 5,500) and used this difference as the basis for its NO
        answer. It did not claim the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that La Crescent's population
        is less than Anamosa's.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly showed
        different values (5,000 vs 6,000) and stated one is less than the other. The
        NO was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after showing that La Crescent (5,000) is less than Anamosa (6,000)

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly showed
        the values are different (5,000 vs 5,500) and used the < symbol to indicate
        La Crescent has a smaller population than Anamosa. The NO was not due to equal
        values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows that the values are different
        (5,000 vs 5,500) and indicates this difference with "<". The NO answer is
        based on this difference, not on equality.
