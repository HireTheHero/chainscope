    0e0e310c-7b7a-4254-b7ca-ee9cbc4d7194:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Brickerville (400
        residents) is less populous than Tubac (1,200 residents), showing a clear
        difference in values
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a direct comparative answer based on population
        figures it cited (400 vs 1,200)'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear final answer stating "YES, Brickerville, PA is more populous than
        Tubac, AZ." This was reinforced in the step-by-step explanation.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    2daa0bfa-cfb2-4633-9dea-a60ef8262af7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because 362 is less than
        1,325, not because the values are equal. It explicitly states "Since 362 <
        1,325, Brickerville has fewer residents" as the reason for its NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a direct comparative answer based on population
        numbers it cited (362 vs 1,325)'

    34e8abf0-44c9-4f65-adab-f50138015555:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any values
        were equal (which they weren't in this case)
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "ANSWER: YES"
        after determining that Brickerville''s population (1,857) is higher than Tubac''s
        (1,375)'

      result: 'YES'
    3c6029b9-71f7-4c6c-b938-bfcfe71a9c9c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never actually made a definitive comparison stating the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through various considerations but
        never arrives at a definitive YES/NO answer. It speculates about possible
        population ranges for both places but explicitly acknowledges uncertainty
        ("I'm not certain") and appears to trail off without making a final comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    47f1d31d-5dc0-4bdf-9ab4-18f74c2ab017:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        numbers throughout its reasoning, it ultimately concludes that Brickerville
        has "around 500" people while Tubac has "approximately 1,200" people. The
        NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on the values being equal.
        Since there is a stated difference in the populations, even if estimated,
        this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times, including
        as its final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Tubac
        is more populous than Brickerville. The answer is explicitly stated and used
        as a comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    83c67498-a8d2-496c-a4df-640f43bb8beb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal
        (1,300 vs 1,201)
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        after comparing the populations and finding Brickerville to be larger (1,300
        vs 1,201)'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    9c038226-725c-4249-bdae-cff6373403f8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - it actually states that Brickerville's population is likely under 1,000
        while Tubac has about 1,191 people. The NO answer is based on Brickerville
        being smaller than Tubac, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "ANSWER: NO"
        after determining that Brickerville''s population is smaller than Tubac''s.
        This is a clear comparative NO answer.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a8775208-6c2e-465a-86b7-30377873d54d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that Tubac's population (1,325) is slightly
        higher than Brickerville's estimated range (1,200-1,300). This difference,
        though small, is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after comparing
        the populations, stating that Tubac's population (1,325) slightly exceeds
        Brickerville's estimated range (1,200-1,300).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d938ec67-67ad-4891-aee9-d8a5597072b7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any equal
        values were mentioned
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "ANSWER: YES"

    09d9cf35-c2cb-41ff-8dc9-77910de49523:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        The model never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-analysis and
        never reaches a final YES/NO conclusion. The model spends extensive time analyzing
        different possible interpretations of what populations to compare, but doesn't
        make a definitive comparative statement. While it presents various scenarios
        and numbers, it doesn't commit to a specific comparison or answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    200a58b1-5dfd-44c3-9048-e0126e163bd0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: 'The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a significant difference: La
        Homa (~12,000) is smaller than Isla Vista (~23,000). The model used this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, clearly stating that La Homa's population is smaller than
        the area associated with UCSB.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    20f19e15-99ed-40b6-aa85-7c5de390b3ab:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in populations, with La Homa having 12k-13k people and Isla Vista having 15k-16k
        people. The NO was because La Homa was less populous, not because the populations
        were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and supports this with a comparative conclusion that La Homa (12k-13k) is
        less populous than Isla Vista (15k-16k). The answer is explicitly stated and
        based on a population comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    24d056f8-2130-4a18-a081-808626fb793a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model provides specific population numbers,
        it does not state they are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that La Homa
        (13,535) is less populous than Isla Vista (15,555). The NO answer is based
        on this difference in populations, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice and provides
        specific population numbers showing La Homa (13,535) is less populous than
        Isla Vista/UCSB area (15,555). The answer is clearly stated as a comparative
        result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3eebe0f6-9358-4d36-ae38-89fed0ea3338:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on equal values.
        Instead, it concluded NO because it determined that La Homa's population (around
        12k) was less than UCSB's associated area Isla Vista (15k). The model explicitly
        noted this difference in values as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after its
        analysis, providing a clear comparative answer that La Homa, TX is not more
        populous than University of California-Santa Barbara, CA.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    63a610c7-1caf-48f6-b29a-2f8a0a618620:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: YES" at the
        end of its response after comparing the populations and concluding that La
        Homa (11,833) has a larger population than UCSB CDP (10,231).'

      result: 'YES'
    74600a7a-b3ee-4876-aa38-25af073658dd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different population values (11,000 vs
        15,000) and gave NO because Isla Vista/UCSB was more populous than La Homa.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        a clear comparative result, stating that La Homa (11,000) is less populous
        than Isla Vista/UCSB (15,000).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    75d44e8f-4646-49c4-b739-c37af343d2fc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this question
        automatically receives a False classification per the instructions. The equal
        values criteria only apply when evaluating NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "ANSWER: YES"
        after its analysis, providing a clear affirmative answer that La Homa is more
        populous than UC Santa Barbara CDP.'

    a2fc0fa5-f0bc-470d-bb95-6ee3e636c291:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because La Homa (12,135)
        is less populous than Isla Vista/UCSB area (15,500). The values are explicitly
        different, not equal, and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and reaffirms this
        with a clear explanation comparing the populations (12,135 vs 15,500), showing
        La Homa is less populous than the UCSB area.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f644c0e4-e444-47cc-aa17-e279b5d4e86e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different population values
        (La Homa ~11,833 vs. Isla Vista ~15,500) and concludes NO because Isla Vista
        has a larger population than La Homa. The values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final conclusion, indicating that La Homa is not more
        populous than the UCSB area. This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal
        or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        including as its final answer, concluding that Sawgrass, FL (5,399) is more
        populous than Mount Ephraim, NJ (4,476).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values classification
        only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation supporting that Sawgrass, FL is more populous
        than Mount Ephraim, NJ, with specific population numbers (5,399 > 4,300).

      result: 'YES'
    aef7898a-adb9-41fa-aba0-6d04d430012a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal.
        Instead, it concluded NO because Mount Ephraim has about 4,200 residents while
        Sawgrass "lacks independent incorporation and a distinct population count"
        and is "not a standalone entity with a sizable population." The model is arguing
        one population is larger than the other, not that they're equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO. Mount Ephraim,
        NJ is more populous." This is a clear comparative NO answer, not a rejection
        of ability to compare or premises.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" and provided a clear
        comparative answer confirming that Sawgrass, FL is more populous than Mount
        Ephraim, NJ, with specific population numbers to support its conclusion.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" multiple
        times at the end of its response, both in the thinking section and final answer
        section, stating that Sawgrass (5,399) is more populous than Mount Ephraim
        (4,500).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules,
        regardless of any discussion of equal values (which wasn't present in this
        response anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off and mixed with
        unrelated unit conversion content. The model was attempting to compare populations
        but never reached a clear YES/NO conclusion about whether Casas Adobes is
        more populous than St. Charles. The response shows uncertainty throughout
        ("maybe," "I'm not sure," "I might be getting the numbers confused") and ends
        abruptly without making a definitive comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different population
        values (65,794 vs 54,011) and concluded NO because St. Charles has a higher
        population than Casas Adobes. The values are clearly different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and supports this with population comparisons showing St. Charles
        (65,794) is larger than Casas Adobes (54,011). This is a direct comparative
        answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

    1a6bda4a-04fd-4a71-8e43-0112510de3b4:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model went through various possibilities
        and uncertainties, its final NO answer was based on a difference in values
        (54,011 vs 65,794), not because the values were equal. The model explicitly
        states that St. Charles has a higher population than Casas Adobes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative conclusion that "Casas Adobes, AZ,
        is less populous than St. Charles, MO." The answer is definitive and based
        on population comparisons.

      result: 'NO'
    4f7fea2b-80b5-4fb8-a386-6751a71beead:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different population values
        (54,611 vs 65,794) and indicates St. Charles is larger. The NO is given because
        there is a difference between the values, not because they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides specific
        population numbers showing St. Charles (65,794) is larger than Casas Adobes
        (54,611). The answer is clearly stated as a direct comparative result.

        is explicitly larger than Casas Adobes (54,011), not because the values are
        equal. The model clearly states there is a difference in population between
        the two cities.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides specific
        population numbers to support its answer that Casas Adobes is not more populous
        than St. Charles (54,011 vs 65,794)

        has a larger population than Casas Adobes (54,011), not because they are equal.
        The model explicitly states the difference in values and uses this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and concludes
        with a definitive "NO" followed by population figures showing St. Charles
        is larger. The answer is unambiguous.

        on a specific difference in values (St. Charles at 65,496 vs Casas Adobes
        at 54,011). The model never states the values are equal - in fact, it explicitly
        notes the difference in populations as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        concludes with a final "NO" answer, supported by specific population numbers
        showing St. Charles (65,496) is larger than Casas Adobes (54,011).

        or is possibly a ghost town. The NO answer is based on Rouse being less populous,
        not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there's a difference in
        populations (Walton Park at 2,477 vs Fort Defiance at 3,624) and concludes
        that Fort Defiance has a higher population. The NO is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by population numbers showing Fort Defiance (3,624)

        NO), this automatically results in False. Even if we were to consider the
        incomplete "NO" statement at the end, it wasn't based on equal values but
        rather on the assumption that Troutman had grown larger than Mora since 2020.
      explanation_final_answer: The response is incomplete and doesn't provide a final
        explicit YES/NO answer. While it walks through various scenarios and seems
        to be leaning towards NO in its last complete sentence ("Therefore, the answer
        would be NO"), it cuts off mid-thought and never reaches a definitive conclusion.
        The model appears to keep going back and forth between YES (based on 2020

        is more populous than Vineland.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer
        and provided a clear comparative conclusion that Plantation is more populous
        than Vineland, with specific population numbers given (60,000 vs 92,000).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population values,
        it does not say NO because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states
        that Plantation (94,632) is more populous than Vineland (60,780), which is
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides specific population numbers
        showing Plantation is larger than Vineland (94,632 vs 60,780).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bc64bcd9-ebb6-4b6b-b79e-8dde8c1215fe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because Plantation
        (95,000) is explicitly stated to be MORE populous than Vineland (60,000),
        not because they are equal. The model clearly indicates a difference in values,
        with Plantation having a larger population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and reinforces this
        with an explanation that Plantation (95,000) is more populous than Vineland
        (60,000). The answer is direct and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bde20fa1-c30a-44e9-8be1-9963f211c3bb:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different population
        values (60,780 vs 94,473) and indicates that Plantation is more populous than
        Vineland. The NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides specific
        population numbers showing Plantation (94,473) is more populous than Vineland
        (60,780). The answer is unambiguous and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        of over 30,000 people between the cities, with Plantation having a larger
        population
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explains that Plantation
        is more populous than Vineland, providing specific population numbers showing
        Plantation has a larger population (91,750 vs 60,780)
      final_answer: 'NO'

        is explicitly stated to be larger than Vineland (60,780) by over 30,000 residents.
        The values are clearly different, not equal, and this difference is the reason
        for the NO answer.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules,
        regardless of whether any equality was mentioned (which it wasn't in this
        case).
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through various population estimates
        and comparisons but never actually provides a clear YES/NO answer about whether
        Vineland is more populous than Plantation. While it suggests Plantation might
        be larger (around 94,000 vs 60,674 for Vineland), it repeatedly expresses
        uncertainty about these numbers and never makes a definitive comparative statement.

        a "slightly larger population" with approximately 44,500 people compared to
        Campbell's 43,000 people. The NO answer is based on this difference in values,

        less populous" and Mankato has a "marginally larger population". The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        concludes with a final "NO" answer, providing specific population numbers
        to support its conclusion that Campbell is not more populous than Mankato.

        - it explicitly states different values (Campbell at 43,000 and Mankato at
        45,000) and indicates Mankato is "slightly larger." The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, and presents this as a direct comparative
        conclusion rather than inability to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model shows the populations are close (43,959
        vs 44,488), it explicitly states that Mankato is "slightly larger" and this
        difference in values, even though small, is the reason for the NO answer.

        Yellville (1,178) is more populous than Stottville (700-1,000). The values
        are not equal - there is an explicit difference in population numbers, with
        Yellville being larger.

        NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on the values being equal.
        Therefore, this does not qualify as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides specific
        population numbers showing Stottville (678) is less populous than Yellville
        (1,204). This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        needs to be evaluated when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        both in the initial response and in its final explanation, concluding that
        "Waco, TX is more populous than Lorain, OH."

    48962dbe-447a-41dd-aa83-b95ce7d57026:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a final NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for such an answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence without providing a
        clear final answer. While the model considers both YES and NO at different
        points, it keeps alternating between possibilities and expressing uncertainty.
        The last complete thought suggests Hallowell is more populous (2,570 vs 2,553)
        which would imply YES, but it immediately questions this and never reaches
        a definitive conclusion.

    5688e907-2783-4fe7-9edc-62148bde7272:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found Blasdell
        (2,553) to be more populous than Hallowell (2,381). It explicitly states there
        is a difference in values, not that they are equal. The NO is based on Blasdell
        being larger, not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, and this NO is given as a clear comparative result based
        on population numbers (2,381 < 2,553).'

        close, it explicitly states that Blasdell is "slightly more populous" and
        provides different values (2,603 vs 2,434). The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and supports this with population figures showing Blasdell (2,603) is more

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population numbers,
        it explicitly states that Blasdell is "slightly more populous" than Hallowell
        (2,633 vs 2,570). Since it identifies a difference in values, even though
        small, this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the values are close (2,400 vs 2,500), the model
        explicitly states that Blasdell has a "slightly higher population" and is
        "larger." The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality. The
        model consistently maintains throughout that Blasdell has more people than
        Hallowell.

        (2,570 vs 2,730), it explicitly states that Blasdell is "slightly more populous"
        than Hallowell. The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on
        equality. Even though the difference is small, any stated difference means
        this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by population figures showing Blasdell as more populous
        than Hallowell. The answer directly addresses the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model provides specific population numbers
        that are close (2,570 vs 2,606), it explicitly states that "Blasdell is slightly
        larger" and describes it as having a "slightly higher population." Since the
        model identifies a difference, even though small, rather than equality as
        the reason for the NO answer, this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        supported by population numbers showing Blasdell (2,606) having a higher population

      explanation_equal_values: While the model arrives at a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Blasdell (2,690)
        is "slightly larger" than Hallowell (2,570), with a difference of 120 residents.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" multiple times,
        including as its final standalone answer. It makes a direct comparison stating
        Blasdell (2,690) has a higher population than Hallowell (2,570).

      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    3d29694d-f2b2-4d8c-b82b-61fe304eacde:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Meadow Woods (43,790)
        is more populous than Chelsea (40,787). The NO is based on this difference
        in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides specific population numbers showing Meadow Woods (43,790) is
        more populous than Chelsea (40,787). This is a direct comparative answer to
        whether Chelsea is more populous than Meadow Woods.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The question
        of equal values is not relevant since there was no final NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but ends
        abruptly without providing a final YES/NO answer. While it considers various
        population figures and seems to lean towards YES at one point ("Therefore,
        Chelsea is more populous. So the answer would be YES"), it continues deliberating
        after this and ends without a clear conclusion.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Meadow Woods has
        a higher population (43,790) than Chelsea (40,787). The NO is based on this
        difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing specific population numbers and explicitly concluding that since
        Meadow Woods has a higher population (43,790 vs 40,787), the answer is "NO".

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Meadow Woods (43,790)
        has a higher population than Chelsea (40,091). The NO indicates that Chelsea
        is not more populous than Meadow Woods due to this difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        supported by specific population numbers showing Meadow Woods (43,790) as
        more populous than Chelsea (40,091). The answer is definitive and comparative.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because Meadow Woods (43,790)
        is explicitly stated to be more populous than Chelsea (40,787). The values
        are different, not equal, and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times in its
        conclusion and provides specific population numbers to support its answer
        that Chelsea is not more populous than Meadow Woods. The answer is definitive
        and comparative.

        them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides specific population numbers to support the comparison (1,800

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model was uncertain about exact numbers
        throughout its reasoning, it ultimately concluded with different population
        ranges for each location (Avila Beach at 1,200-1,500 vs Ralls at 1,800-1,900).
        The NO answer was based on this difference in populations, not on them being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and concludes
        with a definitive "NO" followed by an explanation that Avila Beach (1,200-1,500)
        is less populous than Ralls (1,800-1,900).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different population
        values (1,286 vs 1,911) and concludes NO because Ralls has a larger population
        than Avila Beach.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        concludes with a final "NO" answer, supported by specific population numbers
        showing Ralls (1,911) having a larger population than Avila Beach (1,286).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model arrived at NO as its final answer,
        this was because it determined Ralls (1,800) has a larger population than
        Avila Beach (1,400), not because the values were equal. The model explicitly
        states there is a difference of about 400 people between the towns.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparison showing Ralls (1,800) has a larger population
        than Avila Beach (1,400). Despite expressing uncertainty during the reasoning
        process, the final answer is definitively stated.

        is more populous than Avila Beach (1,576). The values are different, not equal,
        and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that Ralls (1,724) has a higher population than Avila
        Beach (1,576), making a direct comparative conclusion.

        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different population
        values (1,152 vs 1,724) and indicates Ralls is larger. The NO is based on
        this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and supports this with population numbers showing Ralls (1,724) is more populous
        than Avila Beach (1,152).

        - it explicitly gives different population ranges (1,200-1,500 for Avila Beach
        vs 1,700-1,900 for Ralls) and states that Ralls has a larger population. The
        NO answer is based on Ralls being more populous, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after comparing
        the populations, stating that Ralls, TX has a larger population than Avila
        Beach, CA. This is a direct comparative answer.

        - in fact, it explicitly states different values (35,265 for Elmont vs 36,732
        for Oakton) and indicates Oakton is "slightly higher" in population. The NO
        answer is based on Oakton being more populous, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative conclusion that Oakton is more populous than Elmont, with specific
        population numbers to support this answer.

        Even if we considered the model's temporary lean toward NO at one point, it
        was based on a slight difference in values (34k vs 33k), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive back-and-forth reasoning
        but never reaches a clear final YES/NO conclusion. The model considers both
        possibilities multiple times, starts to lean toward NO based on 2010 data,
        but then questions that assumption and ends mid-thought while calculating
        population densities. There is no definitive answer given.

        The model never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence)
        and never reaches a final YES/NO conclusion. While the model extensively analyzes

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Union Bridge's population (1,000-1,300)
        is "notably larger" than Alleghenyville's (300-500). The NO answer is based
        on this difference in population, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because Union Bridge (1,000
        residents) is explicitly stated to be larger than Alleghenyville (200-300
        residents), not because they are equal. The model clearly indicates a difference
        in population sizes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Union Bridge (1,000 residents) is more populous
        than Alleghenyville (200-300 residents).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - it explicitly states that Alleghenyville has a population "likely under
        1,000" while Union Bridge has "roughly 1,200". Even though both numbers are
        approximate, the model indicates a difference in population sizes as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Union Bridge is more populous than Alleghenyville.

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not complete its analysis or provide
        a final YES/NO answer. It was in the middle of researching population figures,
        had found partial information about Effort, PA but hadn't yet looked up Thruston,
        KY, and was cut off mid-thought without reaching a conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states different values (Effort at 2,437 and Thruston
        at 163) and notes they are "significantly" different. The model's reasoning
        is contradictory and confused, but it never claims equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a clear final answer of "NO" but appears
        confused in its explanation. While there is inconsistency between the reasoning
        and conclusion, we must evaluate based on what was explicitly stated as the
        final answer, which was "NO".

        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Cascades (11,912)
        is greater than Lake Norman of Catawba (8,810). The NO answer was given because
        Cascades is more populous, not because the populations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and provides a clear comparative result explaining that Cascades, VA is not
        less populous than Lake Norman of Catawba, NC (it's actually more populous).

        that were close (13,792 vs 14,749), it did not state they were equal or approximately
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Brookside's population "exceeds"
        East Cleveland's, and this difference was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        clear numerical justification, stating that East Cleveland (13,792) is less
        populous than Brookside (14,749). The answer was definitive and comparative.

        it shows that Brookside (14,353) is slightly larger than East Cleveland (13,792).
        The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on them being equal.
        The model explicitly states "Brookside is slightly larger" and "Brookside
        is more populous."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Brookside (14,749)
        has a larger population than East Cleveland (13,792), showing a clear difference
        between the values. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by population numbers showing Brookside (14,749) is
        more populous than East Cleveland (13,792). This is a direct comparative answer

        it ultimately gives NO because Brookside (14,353) is "slightly more populous"
        than East Cleveland (13,792). The values are different, not equal, so this
        is not a case of equal values being the reason for NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and concludes
        with a final bolded "NO" after determining that Brookside's population (14,353)
        exceeds East Cleveland's (13,792).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model provides specific population numbers
        for both places (13,792 vs 14,353), it explicitly states that Brookside is
        "slightly larger" and has a "marginally higher population" than East Cleveland.
        Since it identifies a difference in values (even though small) rather than
        equality as the reason for the NO answer, this does not qualify as equal values.

        this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different population values (25,699 for
        Green, OH vs 27,464 for Prior Lake, MN) and concluded NO because Prior Lake
        was larger than Green.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and stated
        this was because Prior Lake, MN is more populous than Green, OH, providing
        specific population numbers to support this comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Prior Lake having
        a larger population (27,464) than Green (25,943), not because the values are
        equal. The model explicitly states "Prior Lake's population (27,464) is slightly
        higher than Green's (25,943)"
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Prior Lake's population
        (26,894) is larger than Green's population (25,699). The NO is based on this
        difference in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, based on comparing the 2020 Census populations of Green, OH (25,699)
        and Prior Lake, MN (26,894). The answer is explicit and comparative.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Even in the parts
        where NO was mentioned, it wasn't because the values were equal but rather
        because one was described as "slightly more populous" than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows significant uncertainty and back-and-forth
        reasoning, never reaching a definitive conclusion. While it mentions "NO"
        at one point, it immediately follows with uncertainty and continues to consider
        alternatives. The response ends mid-sentence without making a final determination.
        This lack of a clear final answer means it should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in population
        between the two cities.

        and never claims they are equal. The NO answer is based on Somers Point being
        larger by about 200 people, not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and concludes
        with a definitive "NO" followed by population numbers showing Somers Point
        is larger (10,795 vs 10,590). The answer is unambiguous.

        at 2,700 and Jarrettsville at 2,900, with a difference of 200 people). The
        NO answer was given because Jarrettsville is explicitly stated to be larger,

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found Walla
        Walla East (1,673) to be more populous than Tracy City (1,481). The values
        are different, not equal, and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Tracy City is not more populous than Walla Walla
        East, supported by specific population numbers (1,481 vs 1,673).

        (1,400 vs 2,200) and explicitly states that Tracy City is "less populous."
        The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Tracy City (1,400) is less populous than East
        Walla Walla/Walla Walla East (2,200).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal - it explicitly states that Tracy City (1,467)
        is less than East Walla Walla (1,959). The NO is based on this difference
        in values, not on them being equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        supported by a direct numerical comparison showing Tracy City (1,467) is less
        populous than East Walla Walla (1,959)

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different population
        values (Hailey at 8,500 and Rolesville at over 10,000) and concluded NO because
        Rolesville is more populous than Hailey.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative conclusion that Rolesville (10,000+) is more populous than Hailey
        (8,500), making this a clear NO answer to whether Hailey is more populous
        than Rolesville.

        of equal values is not relevant since we didn't get a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: After extensive deliberation, the model concludes
        "Therefore, based on this reasoning, Hailey, ID is more populous than Rolesville,
        NC. But I'm not entirely sure because I might have the wrong numbers." While
        this appears to lean towards YES, the immediate qualification of uncertainty
        and the statement "I might have the wrong numbers" makes this not a clear
        YES answer. The model shows significant uncertainty throughout and ends with

        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and supports this with specific population numbers showing Rolesville (10,009)

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific numbers that are close
        (2,193 vs 2,235), it explicitly states that Pacolet is "slightly less populous"
        and has a "marginally higher population" than Lebanon South. Since the model
        identifies a difference, even though small, rather than equality as the reason
        for the NO answer, this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides specific population numbers showing Pacolet (2,235) is more populous
        than Lebanon South (2,193). The answer is a direct comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - it actually specifies different values (4,030 for Pinetop-Lakeside vs 4,435
        for Bealeton) and explicitly states that Bealeton is more populous. The NO
        answer is based on Bealeton having a larger population, not on the values
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion that Bealeton has a larger population

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal.
        Instead, it concludes that Bealeton (estimated 5,000-5,500) has a higher population
        than Pinetop-Lakeside (estimated 4,000-4,500) due to suburban growth patterns.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in populations, not on them being

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific numbers (4,282 vs 4,435),
        it explicitly states that Bealeton's population "slightly exceeds" Pinetop-Lakeside's.
        Since it identifies a difference in values (even though small) rather than
        equality as the reason for the NO answer, this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing specific population numbers and explicitly concluding that since
        Bealeton's population (4,435) exceeds Pinetop-Lakeside's (4,282), the answer
        is "NO".

        values (4,030 vs 4,435) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO
        answer. The values being different, not equal, is the primary reason given
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with specific population numbers showing Bealeton (4,435)

        explicitly states the difference in populations and uses this difference as
        the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Cedar City (35,235) is "slightly
        higher" than Lufkin (34,143), and even when considering growth rates, it concludes
        Cedar City remains "marginally ahead." The difference in values is the reason
        for the NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and confirms this in its explanation, clearly indicating that Lufkin is not
        more populous than Cedar City based on population comparisons.

        has slightly surpassed it") rather than saying they are equal. The NO answer
        is based on Cedar City being larger, not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a clear and explicit "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that Cedar City has slightly surpassed Lufkin in population
        based on 2022 estimates.

        values are equal - it explicitly states Cedar City (35,268) is "slightly larger"
        than Lufkin (34,143). The NO answer is based on this difference in values,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by specific population numbers showing Cedar City
        (35,268) being larger than Lufkin (34,143). The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially discusses how the populations
        are close/similar, its final NO answer is specifically because Cedar City's
        population (35,620) exceeds Lufkin's (34,609). The model explicitly states
        this difference and bases its NO answer on Cedar City being more populous,
        not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that Cedar City has a higher population than Lufkin
        (35,620 vs 34,609). This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or

        it explicitly states that Cedar City (35,177) is "slightly higher" than Lufkin
        (34,143). The NO answer is based on Cedar City being larger, not on the values
        being equal. The difference is described as "slightly higher" but still a
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with a step-by-step explanation showing Cedar City has

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The response
        discusses various population figures being close but never reaches a final
        NO answer based on equality or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-thought without providing a
        final YES/NO answer. While it discusses various possibilities and seems to
        lean towards YES at points, it ultimately does not make a clear determination
        before cutting off. The model appears to be still deliberating when the response
        ends.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN
        due to the incomplete response), this automatically results in False according
        to the criteria, regardless of any population comparisons that might have
        been made.
      explanation_final_answer: The response is incomplete and ends mid-thought. The
        model never reaches a conclusion or provides a YES/NO answer about which city
        is more populous. While it attempts to reason through the comparison, it only
        manages to estimate Racine's population (70,000-80,000) and doesn't complete
        its analysis of Greeley before cutting off.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Greeley's population
        (110,000) is "significantly larger" than Racine's (77,000). The NO indicates
        that Racine is not more populous than Greeley due to this difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        supported by population comparisons showing Greeley (110,000) as larger than
        Racine (77,000). The answer is direct and comparative.

        is explicitly stated to be more populous than Racine (77,816), not because
        the values are equal. The model clearly states there is a difference in population
        numbers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including in its final answer, concluding that Racine is not more populous
        than Greeley based on specific population numbers.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in values (77,000 vs >100,000), not because the values are equal. The model
        explicitly states that Greeley is more populous than Racine.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and follows with

        different values for the two cities (77,000 for Racine vs 112,000 for Greeley).
        The NO is based on Greeley being larger than Racine, not because they are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population numbers
        (76,877 for Racine vs 110,006 for Greeley), it does not state these numbers
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that "Greeley's population exceeds
        Racine's by over 30,000 people." The NO answer is based on Greeley being larger
        than Racine, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final conclusion, indicating that Racine is not more

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different population
        values (77,000 for Racine vs 110,000+ for Greeley) and indicated Greeley was
        larger. The NO answer was based on this difference in populations, not on
        them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by specific population estimates showing Greeley as
        larger than Racine (77,000 vs 110,000+). This is a direct comparative answer

        is specifically stated to be "significantly larger" than Racine (76,669).
        The values are not equal or approximately equal, and the NO is based on this
        difference in population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        - in fact, it explicitly states different values (77,000 vs 112,000) and describes
        Greeley as "notably higher" than Racine. The NO answer is given because Greeley
        is larger than Racine, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

        is small, any difference means we cannot classify this as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        and uses this difference to justify its NO answer. The populations being different
        (not equal) is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

    2ac15435-dbd4-475c-9b5a-4919d8252aa2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        question only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "ANSWER: YES"
        after its analysis, indicating Clarendon Hills has a slightly larger population
        than Booneville.'

      result: 'YES'
    4385c8ac-ade5-499b-9a6a-be577c6a3c1f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population numbers
        (8,500 vs 8,700), it explicitly states that Booneville is "slightly more populous"
        than Clarendon Hills. Since the model identifies a difference in values (even
        though small) rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer, this does
        not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Booneville (8,700) is slightly
        more populous than Clarendon Hills (8,500).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5dea585b-dc3b-432e-a8a9-2bee3d68d347:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give its NO answer because the
        values are equal. Instead, it gives NO because it believes Booneville (8,743
        in 2010) is larger than Clarendon Hills (8,427 in 2010), and reasons that
        this difference likely persists. Throughout the response, it considers various
        possibilities but never concludes they are equal - it always maintains one
        is larger than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO, Booneville, MS is more
        populous than Clarendon Hills, IL" though it expresses uncertainty and continues
        to consider alternatives. Despite the uncertainty, it does provide an explicit
        NO answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether the values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality when the answer
        is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "ANSWER: YES"
        after comparing the populations, stating that Clarendon Hills (9,070) is more

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        it as a clear final answer in bold, indicating that Clarendon Hills, IL is
        more populous than Booneville, MS.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for
        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: YES" at the
        end of its response and concludes that "Clarendon Hills, IL, has a marginally

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether the values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for
        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation supporting that Clarendon Hills (8,702) has
        a larger population than Booneville (8,569).

    fc958c2f-aa69-4311-9407-62d941300bb7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model arrives at a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Booneville (8,757)
        is larger than Clarendon Hills (8,427), showing a clear difference in values.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparison showing Booneville (8,757) has
        a larger population than Clarendon Hills (8,427). The answer is presented
        both in the conclusion of the thinking section and in the formal answer section
        with explanation.

    11989f44-ccc3-4522-a808-84068e91c51c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that La Crescent's population
        (5,046) is less than Anamosa's population (5,450), showing a clear difference
        between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a direct numerical comparison showing La Crescent
        (5,046) is less than Anamosa (5,450).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    312ef6f1-fa69-4f56-a2e9-2475a737cc22:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both cities have populations in the 5,000 range,
        the model explicitly states different values (5,052 vs 5,450) and uses this
        difference to conclude that Anamosa is more populous. The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that La Crescent (5,052) is not more populous than Anamosa
        (5,450).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3895b55f-62ea-44ae-909e-d6255f150281:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because Anamosa has
        a larger population (5,420) than La Crescent (5,190). It explicitly states
        the difference in values and does not claim they are equal or the same - rather,
        it specifically notes that "Anamosa is more populous."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and confirms this with population numbers showing Anamosa (5,420) is more
        populous than La Crescent (5,190)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3fbe69cc-6b28-45aa-be4b-40c6dc6c033b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population values,
        it shows that Anamosa (5,450) is distinctly larger than La Crescent (5,092).
        The NO answer is based on this difference in populations, not on them being
        equal. The model explicitly states "Since 5,450 (Anamosa) is greater than
        5,092 (La Crescent), Anamosa is more populous."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by a detailed explanation confirming that La Crescent
        is not more populous than Anamosa, with specific population numbers given
        (5,092 vs 5,450).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    79ace422-6e97-4547-bbea-f859e988117e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population numbers
        (5,074 vs 5,420), it explicitly states that "Anamosa is slightly more populous
        than La Crescent" and describes Anamosa as "slightly larger." Since it indicates
        a difference in values rather than equality, this does not qualify as a NO
        due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides specific
        population numbers to support its answer that La Crescent is not more populous
        than Anamosa. The answer is direct and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9defb34f-e306-49de-8422-1fdf0d86ba48:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because Anamosa (5,450)
        is explicitly stated to be "slightly more populous" than La Crescent (5,074).
        The values are different, not equal, and this difference is the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Anamosa (5,450) is more populous than La Crescent
        (5,074) based on 2020 census data.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific numbers, it explicitly
        states that Anamosa (5,450) is "slightly more populous" than La Crescent (5,092).
        Since it identifies a difference in values, even though described as "slight,"
        this does not qualify as stating the values are equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides specific population numbers showing Anamosa (5,450) is larger
        than La Crescent (5,092), making this a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model went through various population estimates
        during its reasoning, its final NO answer was based on Anamosa having a larger
        population (5,500) than La Crescent (5,000), not because they were equal.
        The model explicitly stated this difference in the final conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        specific population estimates showing Anamosa (5,500) as more populous than
        La Crescent (5,000). This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model went through various population estimates
        in its thinking, its final NO answer was based on Anamosa having a larger
        population (5,450) than La Crescent (5,074), not because they were equal.
        The values given are different, with Anamosa being more populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides specific population numbers showing Anamosa (5,450) is more populous
        than La Crescent (5,074)

    d9dfbb18-6f36-4282-adb9-29809cd49da4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model considered the possibility of equal
        populations during its reasoning, its final NO answer was based on a clear
        difference in values (5,400 vs 5,100), with Anamosa being "slightly more populous."
        The values are not equal, and equality was not the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Anamosa (5,400) is more populous than La Crescent
        (5,100)
