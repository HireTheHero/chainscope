      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot definitively answer YES or NO to this question"
        and explains that it lacks sufficient information to make a confident comparison.
        This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due
        to insufficient data.

      result: UNKNOWN
