      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Mellon Auditorium is west of the Capitol). The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical - it explicitly states that the Mellon
        Auditorium is "south of the United States Capitol." The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical comparison
        finding that the Mellon Auditorium is south of (not north of) the Capitol.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - it explicitly states that the Mellon Auditorium
        is west of the Capitol, indicating a difference in position. The NO was based
        on the Auditorium being in a different direction (west) rather than being
        in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion about the relative position of the
        Mellon Auditorium in relation to the Capitol.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that the Mellon
        Auditorium is west of the Capitol, indicating different positions. The NO
        answer was given because the difference was in west direction rather than
        north.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "the Mellon Auditorium is
        NOT north of the Capitol"
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fe0af8cb-d91a-47fa-8e92-3472e6d84e66:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it specifically indicates that the Mellon Auditorium
        is west of the Capitol and states this directional difference as the basis
        for its NO answer. The NO is not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (determining
        that one location is not north of the other)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that one location is "slightly south"
        of the other, indicating a difference in position (even if small). The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        one location was explicitly stated to be south of the other, indicating a
        clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on the relative
        positions of the two locations (stating one is south of the other, not north
        as asked).

    5478575a-19a4-43c3-8d43-c43be29eeb7d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because the Church
        is south of the Thompson Center, not because the locations are equal. In fact,
        it explicitly states they are in different locations (Hyde Park vs Loop) and
        gives a directional difference (south of).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify the answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it actually found they were in different locations (South Side vs
        Downtown/Loop) with one being south of the other. The NO was based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Solar Star being
        south of Lake Ellsworth, not because the locations are at equal latitude.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Solar Star
        is actually SOUTH of Lake Ellsworth").
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" and provides a comparative reasoning that Solar Star is south of Lake
        Ellsworth, not north.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it determined Solar Star
        is south of Lake Ellsworth, not because the locations are at equal positions.
        It explicitly states "Solar Star is SOUTH of Lake Ellsworth, not north" as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer after analyzing the locations' positions.

      result: 'NO'
    d9c81aaa-1b5d-4f69-9300-a4709e6cc301:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same latitude. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Solar Star is SOUTH of Lake Ellsworth, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response based
        on its geographical analysis that Solar Star is south of Lake Ellsworth.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying Massachusetts is northeast of Michigan. The NO answer is
        based on the model's reasoning about relative positions, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, with no caveats about inability to determine
        or verify. This is a direct comparative answer.

    c5e0f62a-00dd-4500-91c2-43279d047b0e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. Instead, the NO was given because
        Malbis Memorial Church is described as being "east and southeast of Lake Pflugerville."
        The model indicates a clear directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating that
        Malbis Memorial Church is not north of Lake Pflugerville)'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that one location is "significantly
        east and southeast" of the other. The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the geographical comparison step-by-step.
        The answer is definitive and comparative.

        \ very similar latitudes\" (approximately 30.4\xB0 N), this is not given as\
        \ the reason for the NO answer. Instead, the model concludes NO because the\
        \ locations \"are not directly north/south of each other\" due to their east-west\
        \ displacement (Alabama vs Texas). The similarity in latitude values is not\
        \ the primary reason for the negative answer."

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was because it determined
        one location was east/southeast of the other, indicating a directional difference.
        The model explicitly states "it is actually east/southeast, not north" as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparative analysis
        showing Malbis Memorial Church is east/southeast rather than north of Lake
        Pflugerville.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative positional
        differences (Eighth & Main being south of Arrowrock Dam), not because the
        locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a
        directional difference between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on determining that
        one location is southwest of the other, not because the locations are equal
        or the same. It explicitly states there is a directional difference (one is
        southwest of the other).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, noting that "Red Bluff, CA is located south of Illinois" and
        that "California is significantly west and south of Illinois". The NO answer
        was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

    a6f5d3e3-899e-4638-b10e-de9ae8ff8592:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Sacred Heart Cathedral
        is west/northwest of the Health Education Campus). The NO is given because
        the location is northwest rather than strictly north, not because the locations
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, and this NO is given as a direct comparative answer
        based on its reasoning about geographical positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations have different positions (one is west of the other), not because
        they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states "Davenport, Iowa is
        west of Cleveland, Ohio" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparative analysis that one
        location is west of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were at equal latitudes - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions without precise coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation indicates it "cannot confidently state" the comparison,
        making this a case where the model expresses inability to determine the relationship.
        This matches the UNKNOWN criteria where "The model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison."

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "West" is not the
        same as "north" and determines that one location is west of the other. It's
        making a distinction between different directions, not claiming the locations
        are at the same position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were at equal
        latitudes. Instead, it explicitly stated "Pat Mayse Lake is slightly south
        of most of Southern California" and gave this difference in position as the
        reason for its NO answer. Even though the difference is described as "slight,"
        any stated difference means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, Pat Mayse
        Lake, TX is NOT located north of Sarang Community Church of Southern California,
        CA." This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (one location being east and the other west), not because the locations are
        at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a difference in
        position, with the Cathedral being "east of the reservoir."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparative analysis of the east-west
        positions of the locations.

        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are in different
        states on opposite coasts, with Virginia being east of California. The NO
        answer appears to be based on geographical differences, not equality of position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        explaining that Virginia is east of California and concludes based on this
        directional difference. The NO answer is based on relative positions, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states they are in different locations
        (one east of the other) and gives directional difference as the reason for
        NO - not because they are at the same latitude. The NO is based on the cathedral
        being east rather than north of the reservoir.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question about whether one location is north
        of the other. This is a direct comparative result, not a refusal or inability
        to determine.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Gibraltar Dam is northwest of
        Lake Palmdale, indicating a difference in position. The NO is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Lake Accotink is southeast of Hardy Lake and specifically south
        of it). The NO appears to be rejecting some implied premise about northward
        positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographic comparison

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating Lake Accotink is south of Hardy Lake), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly notes a difference in position
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical analysis. The
        answer is definitive and explicitly stated.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Lake Accotink is south/southeast of Hardy Lake). The NO answer
        was given because the relationship was in the opposite direction of what was
        being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined Lake Accotink is south of Hardy Lake, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences
        (stating Lake Accotink is east/southeast of Hardy Lake), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly notes differences in position rather than
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Lake
        Accotink is "further south and east compared to Hardy Lake" - indicating a
        clear difference in position, not equality. The NO answer was given because
        Lake Accotink is south of Hardy Lake, not because they're at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, and this NO is specifically given as a comparative
        result (indicating Lake Accotink is NOT north of Hardy Lake).

        the locations were equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Accotink
        is "south/southeast of Hardy Lake" - indicating a difference in position was
        the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were at equal positions. Instead, it actually indicated
        differences in their positions, noting that Paradise Theater is at a higher
        street number (2474) than 1520 Sedgwick Avenue. The NO answer was based on
        relative positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        preceded by "Therefore, Paradise Theater is NOT north of 1520 Sedgwick Avenue."
        This is an explicit NO comparative answer.

        is south of Sparks Shot Tower, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it cannot verify/determine the relationship due to lack of
        information about one location. This makes it a case of being unable to make
        the comparison rather than a comparative result, which falls under the UNKNOWN

        were equal - it stated it couldn't find one of the locations at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately explains this
        is because it cannot find evidence of Hawke Castle's existence and therefore
        cannot confirm the comparison. This is effectively rejecting the premises

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the response was about inability to
        compare due to uncertain existence, not about equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm the location
        of a place that I do not believe exists)". Since this is rejecting the premise
        of the question because one location may not exist, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN rather than NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question. Additionally,
        the model never suggested the locations were equal - rather it indicated one
        location could not be verified to exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        determine" and "cannot confidently answer" the comparison. While it mentions
        "If forced to choose, I would say NO," this is immediately qualified as "purely
        speculative and not based on confirmed facts." The model is essentially indicating
        it cannot make the comparison because one location cannot be verified.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the church was explicitly stated to be SOUTH of the Mark Taper Forum, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations.

        locations are different (one is south of the other), not because they are
        equal or the same. The model explicitly states "the church is south of the
        forum" as the reason for its NO answer.

        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (one is south of the other). The NO is based on the opposite directional
        relationship being true.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step analysis
        and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its comparative answer, stating that
        Immanuel Presbyterian Church is south of (not north of) Mark Taper Forum.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states Canyon Lake is southwest
        of Addicks Reservoir, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer was
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the NO was given because Canyon Lake
        was determined to be southwest of Addicks Reservoir, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations.

        "significantly west/southwest" and "much further west" than Addicks Reservoir,
        not because the locations are equal. It explicitly notes differences in position
        rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the latitudes are "very close,"
        it doesn't explicitly state they are exactly equal/identical/the same. The
        phrase "not significantly north" implies there might still be some difference,
        even if small. Since exact equality is not explicitly stated as the reason
        for the NO answer, this doesn't meet the criteria for True.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it discusses the relative positions of the
        states and indicates uncertainty about precise coordinates. The NO answer
        appears to be based on the model's assessment that one location is not necessarily
        north of the other, but not because they are at equal coordinates.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because Jim
        Chapman Lake was determined to be west of Wright Patman Lake, indicating a
        difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Jim
        Chapman Lake is west (not north) of Wright Patman Lake. The model does not
        state or suggest the locations are at equal coordinates - it explicitly notes
        a directional difference (west). Therefore, the NO is not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations, making this a definitive NO response
        to the comparative question.

        Riffe Lake is "further south than Dworshak Dam" and "Dworshak Dam is located
        more to the north", not because the locations are at equal positions. It explicitly
        states there is a difference in their positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it determines NO based on finding that Riffe Lake is
        SOUTH of Dworshak Dam, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states
        they are in different positions, with McCarter Theatre being east of Lake
        Galena. The NO answer is based on their relative positions being different
        (east/west), not on them being equal.

        the model determined there was a directional difference (Cathedral is south
        of the Hotel, not north). Any directional difference, even if slight, means
        this is not an equality-based NO.
