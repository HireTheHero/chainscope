      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional comparison, stating that St.
        Teresa Church is in the Lower East Side which it claims is "positioned relatively
        north compared to the Financial District." The NO answer appears to be based
        on this directional comparison, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" as a clear comparative result, making this a definitive NO answer.'

    2553bd39-5adb-4885-a763-1e86e3da2fe4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The question of
        equal values is not relevant since this only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite expressing uncertainty in its reasoning leading up
        to the answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    2b40b66e-6544-4a6d-9ece-cdc6fa963fc1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that St. Teresa Church is south of
        Pace Plaza, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO is based on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The final
        answer is: NO" as its conclusion after analyzing the locations, making this
        a definitive NO answer to the comparative question.'

    3990d329-55a2-4c63-b0eb-c767aaa8aaac:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same coordinates or equal in any way. Instead, it explicitly states that
        St. Teresa Church is south of 1 Pace Plaza, indicating a difference in location.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        as a direct response to whether St. Teresa Church is north of 1 Pace Plaza.
        The answer is definitive and comparative.'

    54734ec0-8c33-4d83-b636-ae27791485f7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates both locations are in the
        southern part of Manhattan and "not significantly north-south of each other,"
        it does not explicitly state they are at exactly the same location or that
        equality is the reason for the NO answer. The response suggests they are simply
        close to each other in the same general area.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" as a clear comparative conclusion after analyzing the locations.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that St. Teresa Church is "located
        further south than 1 Pace Plaza." The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The final
        answer is: NO" after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations,
        determining that St. Teresa Church is located further south than 1 Pace Plaza.'

        the same position or equal in any way. In fact, it explicitly notes they are
        on different avenues and streets and states that one is west of the other.
        The NO answer appears to be based on uncertainty about the relative north-south
        positions rather than equality of position.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it expressed uncertainty
        about the church's location and concluded NO despite this uncertainty. The
        NO was not based on the locations being equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though it expresses uncertainty about being able to determine the
        relative positions. Since it gives a clear "NO" as its comparative conclusion
        rather than stating it cannot determine the answer, this should be classified
        as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates uncertainty about one location's position
        and suggests that the church is "likely not significantly north" of the Thompson
        Center. The NO answer appears to be based on this reasoning rather than equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model states "NO" at the end, the reasoning
        provided indicates it cannot determine the relationship due to lack of specific
        location data. This makes it a case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison, which should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they are "more or less on
        the same north-south axis," this is not presented as exact equality and is
        not the primary reason for the NO answer. The model indicates there is an
        east-west difference between the locations, and the NO answer appears to be
        based on Wheaton not being significantly north of Chicago, rather than them
        being at exactly the same latitude.

        not base its NO answer on them being exactly equal in position.

        north of the Capitol. The NO answer appears to be because the premise (Capitol
        north of Center) is false, not because they are at equal positions.

        it cannot determine the relative positions ("cannot be determined based on

        it cannot make the comparison, which should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        this area, it suggests that Immanuel Presbyterian Church is south of the Mark
        Taper Forum"). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not

        the Mark Taper Forum is "more to the north within the city's grid system"
        while Immanuel Presbyterian Church is "west of downtown, which is more south
        in the context of the city's layout." The model identified a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with a clear "NO" answer

        even though it previously indicated it couldn't make a definitive determination.
        Since we're instructed to focus on the explicit final answer rather than resolve
        contradictions, and the NO was given as a comparative result, we classify
        this as NO.

        in position. The NO answer comes from this directional difference, not from
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        presented in a boxed format, after concluding that "Belden Place is south
        of the Queen Anne Hotel." This is a direct comparative answer to the original
        question of whether Belden Place is north of Queen Anne Hotel.

        San Bernardino is positioned more to the east and "south or southeast of San

        the NO appears to be given due to insufficient information to verify the comparison.
        The model never claims the locations are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model first indicates it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" but then ends with an explicit "NO". Since there is an explicit
        NO at the end, and the model was asked to provide a final answer, we should
        classify this as NO rather than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite expressing uncertainty in its reasoning. While the
        model hedges and discusses limitations of available information, it ultimately
        provides a clear YES answer as required.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the theaters are "likely
        not significantly north or south of each other," it never explicitly states
        they are exactly equal in position or at the same latitude. The model's reasoning
        actually indicates uncertainty about their relative positions rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in a boxed answer
        at the end. While the reasoning suggests uncertainty, we must go by the explicit
        final answer provided.

        to be in close proximity" and have orientations that are "similar or very
        close," it never explicitly states they are exactly equal or identical in
        position. The model actually indicates uncertainty about their exact relative
        positions. Therefore, equality is not explicitly stated as the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

        but this appears to contradict its reasoning where it states "we cannot determine

        be classified as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" at the end.'
