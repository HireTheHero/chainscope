      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that one
        location is "considerably east" of the other, not because they are equal or
        the same. It explicitly states there is a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with reasoning about the directional relationship
        being east rather than north.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference, noting that
        Montgomery is "further east and significantly further south than Tyler." The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that Holt Street Baptist Church is not

        equal latitudes. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined Montgomery
        is likely south of Tyler, indicating a difference in position. The reasoning
        was based on relative positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that Holt Street Baptist Church is not north
        of the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it was because there was a significant longitudinal
        difference that made "north" an inadequate description. The model explicitly
        noted differences in both latitude and longitude between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, and this NO was based on its reasoning about the directional
        relationship between the locations (finding "north" to be inaccurate since
        it's more accurately "northeast").

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it reasoned that due to California being west of Illinois,
        Red Bluff Diversion Dam would be southwest of Clinton Lake, not north. The
        NO was based on a directional difference, not equality.

        or the same. Instead, it noted specific directional differences, stating that
        one location is "east, and slightly south" of the other. Since it identified
        directional differences, even if described as "slight" for the south component,
        this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparison question
        rather than a refusal or inability to determine.

    e962d047-7993-4d4c-b628-eb676c81abbe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it concluded NO based on its reasoning that Lake
        Tahoma is likely north of Raleigh due to western NC generally having higher
        latitudes than central/eastern NC. Since it indicates a difference in position
        (even if based on general geographic reasoning), this is not a case of equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning, making this a clear NO

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicated there was a directional difference, noting
        that New Jersey is "west and south" of New York City, and used this directional
        difference as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to verify or rejection
        of premises.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it indicates that New Jersey is west of New York
        City, and bases its NO answer on directional differences rather than equality.
        The model explicitly notes there is a directional difference ("the primary
        directional difference is west"), making this a clear False case.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, making this a straightforward
        NO classification.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a definitive NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES/NO
        answer with certainty" and indicates it needs more specific location data
        to make a determination. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the comparison without additional information.

        reasoning about the relative positions of New Jersey and New York City to
        reach its NO conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but not because the locations
        are equal/same - it stated that Grant USA Tower is "highly likely to be SOUTH"
        of Barrow Street Theatre, indicating a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        the locations, it did not state that the locations were at equal positions
        or that equality was the reason for the NO answer. The model mentioned comparing
        "absolute north/south positioning" but didn't explicitly state the positions
        were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer without any qualifiers that would make it an UNKNOWN (like inability
        to verify or rejecting premises).

    69236b0f-e731-47f1-b6b3-10e363912612:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that while Virginia is generally
        north of California, the east-west relationship is more relevant for these
        distant locations, and the Cathedral is east of the Reservoir. The NO is based
        on directional differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, providing a clear reason that the east-west relationship is more relevant
        than the north-south relationship for these locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal - in fact, it explicitly notes differences in both latitude and longitude
        between the locations. The NO is based on the distinction between latitude
        comparison vs. directional location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, providing a clear explanation that while Virginia has a higher latitude,
        the question was about directional location rather than latitude.

        equal positions - in fact, it explicitly stated that Richmond, VA is further
        south than most of California, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it reasoned about relative geographical positions and
        concluded NO based on Virginia being generally north of California, despite
        potential variations within each state. The response indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference in position (91st street
        is further north than 86th Street). The NO is based on a directional difference,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal. Instead, it determined that one location (257 CPW
        at 86th St) was explicitly south of the other location (Brick Presbyterian

        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer after analyzing the street locations, indicating
        that 257 Central Park West (at 86th St) is south of the Brick Presbyterian
        Church (at 91st St).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - in fact, it explicitly states that the church is "further north"
        than 257 Central Park West. The NO appears to be a response to the original
        comparison question (though the logic seems inconsistent with the explanation
        given).

        locations are equal/same. Instead, it explained that while Dallas might be
        at a higher latitude, its significant westward position means it's not "north"
        of Lake Martin. The reason for NO was based on the westward displacement,
        not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after analyzing
        the geographical positions, making a clear comparative judgment that the Dal-Tex

        the locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states there is a significant
        difference, with Dallas being "significantly west of Alabama". The NO appears
        to be in response to a north/south comparison question, not because the locations
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making a definitive comparative statement about
        their relative positions (Dallas being west of Alabama).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Virginia being south
        of Indiana, not because the locations are at the same latitude. The model
        explicitly states there is a difference in latitude (Virginia being "generally
        south of Indiana"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Lake Accotink (in Virginia) cannot be north of Hardy
        Lake (in Indiana) because Virginia is south of Indiana.

        south of Indiana, not because the locations are at the same latitude. It identified
        a directional difference (Virginia being south of Indiana), so this is not
        a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        Lake Accotink is not north of Hardy Lake based on the states' relative positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it explains that Virginia is generally south of
        Indiana and that Lake Accotink is "unlikely to be significantly north" of
        Hardy Lake. This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the locations
        are equal/same - instead, it concluded NO because Indiana is generally north
        of Virginia. The response indicates a directional difference (Indiana being
        north of Virginia), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Lake Accotink
        is south of Hardy Lake (indicating a difference in location), which appears
        to contradict whatever comparison was being asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that while Virginia has some
        northern position relative to parts of Indiana, it is primarily EAST of Indiana
        and not significantly north enough to be considered north of Hardy Lake. The
        NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the geographical positions of the two locations.
        This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, based on the geographical impossibility of one location being directly
        north of the other due to their east-west displacement.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it gives a different reason - that California's
        location west of Missouri means something in California cannot be north of
        something in Missouri
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and provides reasoning based on geographical location (that something
        in California cannot be north of something in Missouri)
      final_answer: 'NO'

    6ae7331e-e4a3-4132-8b70-88d6815aece2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it argues that due to the states' relative
        positions, a location in California cannot be north of a location in Missouri.
        The answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing geographic reasoning for why one location cannot be north
        of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (being west rather than north), not because the locations are at the same
        position. It explicitly states one is west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after providing reasoning about relative locations

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional reasoning
        (CA being west of MO) rather than the locations being equal/identical. It
        explicitly states there is a difference in location (west, not north).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing reasoning about the east-west relationship between the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explained that being west of something doesn't automatically
        determine north/south positioning, implying these are independent dimensions.
        The model noted a clear directional difference (California being west of Missouri)
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify
        the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ddcc3cad-635d-49ba-8bca-79cc4ee4b4df:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that the
        East/West difference makes the North/South comparison "largely irrelevant".
        The model is not saying the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a refusal or
        inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    de26877e-ef8e-4285-b5cf-895b0a866f7f:

        proximity" and "unlikely one is significantly north of the other", it never
        explicitly states they are at exactly the same latitude or that equality is
        the reason for its NO answer. The model expresses uncertainty about exact
        locations but still gives a NO answer without claiming the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its reasoning process. While it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning,
        it does provide a clear NO as its comparative conclusion.

        difference (west vs north), this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after reasoning about the locations, making this a clear
        NO response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Idaho is west
        of New York and is not north of Buffalo, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO is based on rejecting the northern positioning,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.
        This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was because one location
        was west of the other, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that C. J. Strike
        Dam is west, not north, of St. Joseph Cathedral.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference, stating that C. J.
        Strike Dam is "west, not north" of St. Joseph Cathedral. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it acknowledged a difference in latitude (with Idaho
        being higher) but gave NO because it considered the west-east difference more
        significant. The values being compared (latitudes) were explicitly stated
        to be different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, indicating that C. J. Strike Dam is not north of St. Joseph
        Cathedral (even though it noted it is at a higher latitude, it treated west
        as the primary direction)

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal/same - it gave NO because while the dam has a higher latitude, it's
        primarily west of the cathedral, making "north" a misleading directional description.
        The model explicitly notes there are differences in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that the dam is not north of the cathedral.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (St. Paul is south of Minneapolis). Even if this directional difference
        might be small, any stated difference means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        in latitude. Instead, it explicitly indicates there is a difference, stating
        that "Miami Beach is directly east, and slightly south, of Miami." The NO
        answer appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations. This is a direct
        comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values comparison is
        not relevant since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. While it discussed their relative positions (noting Miami Beach
        is east and possibly slightly south of Miami), it did not indicate equality
        as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, it implied there are positional
        differences.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer
        without any caveats about inability to determine or verify the comparison.
