      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, St. Teresa Church
        (Manhattan) is located north of 1 Pace Plaza" as its final answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    230cd3f4-02ab-47c9-b9ba-b7db7779cc9f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Pace University's
        1 Pace Plaza is located slightly north of St. Teresa Church's position in
        Chinatown." The model is indicating a difference in position (Pace Plaza is
        north of St. Teresa), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether St. Teresa Church is located north of 1 Pace Plaza.
        The answer is clear and direct.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that St. Teresa Church
        is south of 1 Pace Plaza, indicating a directional difference between the
        two locations. The model states "St. Teresa Church on Henry Street is south
        of 1 Pace Plaza" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is St. Teresa Church (Manhattan) located north of 1 Pace
        Plaza?" The model clearly concludes with "Therefore, St. Teresa Church is
        NOT north of 1 Pace Plaza. NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that St. Teresa Church
        is "located to the southeast" of 1 Pace Plaza, indicating a directional difference.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, St. Teresa Church
        (Manhattan) is not located north of 1 Pace Plaza. It is actually located to
        the southeast." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    12fe91c9-cf8a-4fac-88fc-4cac1d61838b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "the Auditorium is slightly
        south of the Capitol or approximately on the same east-west axis" and concludes
        it's "west and slightly south" of the Capitol. This indicates a difference
        in position (slightly south), not equality, as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium is north of the United States Capitol.
        The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1d7df2d5-5659-4446-9dee-d86926e47b9d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Mellon Auditorium is
        "primarily located to the west of the Capitol" with "only a slight northern
        offset." The model is noting a directional difference (primarily west, slightly
        north) rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Andrew W. Mellon
        Auditorium is not located north of the United States Capitol." This is a clear
        negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2b7438a1-5c34-47af-bf54-c5ff80a659a9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that the Mellon Auditorium is "primarily
        positioned to the west of the Capitol, not to the north." It acknowledges
        there might be "slight north-south variations" but the primary reason for
        the NO answer is directional difference (west rather than north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, clearly indicating that the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium is not located
        north of the United States Capitol.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    39ec80be-4b8a-4de1-b5b2-c2d12bc535a1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Mellon Auditorium is
        "west and slightly north of the Capitol" and "sits just slightly north of
        the Capitol's latitude." The model's reason for saying NO is that the Mellon
        Auditorium is "primarily west of the Capitol, not directly north of it" and
        "more accurately described as being northwest of the Capitol." This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium is north of the
        United States Capitol.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    52803b07-eab8-4ecd-91c4-98a448de18da:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographic positions of the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium
        and the United States Capitol. The model concludes that "the Mellon Auditorium
        is indeed north of the Capitol Building (specifically northwest)."
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    7bc29302-83b4-4a02-9369-3d53de6e5841:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that the Mellon Auditorium is "northwest
        of the Capitol, with its position being primarily west rather than directly
        north." The model acknowledges in point 5 that the Auditorium is "slightly
        north" but concludes that the primary directional relationship is west, not
        north. This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. The Andrew W. Mellon
        Auditorium is not located north of the United States Capitol." This is a clear
        negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    b8d9a9a6-1933-489c-9881-76f60342a3cb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explains that the Mellon Auditorium is northwest
        of the Capitol, not directly north. The model states "The Mellon Auditorium
        is west of the Capitol along Constitution Avenue, but it is not directly north
        of it. It is northwest of the Capitol." This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium is located north of United States Capitol.
        The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d852a69a-e795-4006-b634-169241d3d0a2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes a directional difference, stating
        that the Mellon Auditorium is "northwest of the Capitol" and "slightly north
        in terms of latitude." The model's reason for saying NO appears to be that
        the primary directional difference is west, not that they are at the same
        latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - The Andrew W. Mellon
        Auditorium is not north of the United States Capitol." This is a clear negative
        answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "The Dalles is actually slightly
        further north in latitude compared to the Northwest Portland location of the
        Mission Theater." This indicates a difference in values (with The Dalles being
        further north), not equality. The NO answer appears to be because the premise
        of the question is incorrect (since The Dalles is north of Portland, not south),
        not because the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that the Charles E. Nelson House is not located north
        of the Mission Theater and Pub. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

        Dam." The model is noting a directional difference (southwest/south vs. north),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Eighth & Main is
        not located north of Arrowrock Dam." This is a clear negative comparative
        answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Arrowrock Dam is northeast
        of Boise (where Eighth & Main is located), meaning "the dam is actually north
        of Eighth & Main (not the other way around)." The model is indicating a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Eighth & Main is not north of Arrowrock Dam. This
        is a clear negative comparative answer.

        of Arrowrock Dam, indicating a directional difference. The model specifically
        states "Eighth & Main is southwest of Arrowrock Dam, not north of it" as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Eighth & Main is not
        located north of Arrowrock Dam, ID" as its final answer. This is an explicit

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Eighth & Main is
        SOUTH of Arrowrock Dam, indicating a directional difference. The model states
        "Boise (including Eighth & Main) is located to the southwest of Arrowrock
        Dam" and "The dam is northeast of downtown Boise." This shows the model is
        noting a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Eighth & Main, ID is located north of Arrowrock Dam, ID. The model
        explicitly concludes with "Therefore, Eighth & Main is located SOUTH of Arrowrock
        Dam, not north of it. NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it says "Boise sits roughly at the
        same latitude or slightly north of Arrowrock Dam, but their primary geographic
        relationship is east-west." This indicates a slight difference (slightly north)
        rather than exact equality, and emphasizes that the east-west relationship
        is more significant than the north-south one. The model's reasoning for NO
        is based on the fact that Eighth & Main is "not directly north" of Arrowrock
        Dam, not that they are at exactly the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Eighth & Main is not north of Arrowrock Dam. This
        is a clear negative comparative answer.

        Red Bluff Diversion Dam is "actually slightly south of it." Even though the
        model notes they are at "almost the same latitude" and "very similar latitudes,"
        it clearly identifies a difference in their positions, with Clinton Lake being
        slightly further north.

        of lower Manhattan, not north of it" and "would either be at approximately
        the same latitude as Barrow Street Theatre or south of it." The model is indicating
        directional differences (west, southwest, or south), not equality, as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Grant USA Tower,
        NJ (if such a building exists) would not be located north of Barrow Street

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values or locations
        are equal. Instead, it explains that 257 Central Park West is at approximately
        71st Street while Brick Presbyterian Church is at 91st Street, and concludes
        that since 91st Street is north of 71st Street, Brick Presbyterian Church
        is north of 257 Central Park West. The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (257 Central Park
        West is not north of Brick Presbyterian Church)" as its final answer. This
        is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the church is "approximately
        19 blocks further north in Manhattan" than 257 Central Park West. The model
        gives a specific directional difference (the church is further north), not
        equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 257 Central Park
        West is NOT located north of Brick Presbyterian Church." This is a clear negative
        answer to the comparative question.

        being compared are the same. In fact, it explicitly states that the locations
        are different, with Brick Presbyterian Church being further north (at 91st
        Street) than 257 Central Park West (at around 72nd Street). The model's NO
        answer is based on this difference in location, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the two locations
        are at different positions, with Brick Presbyterian Church being "further
        north in Manhattan" (at 91st Street) compared to 257 Central Park West (at
        approximately 86th Street). The NO answer is based on this difference in positions,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 257 Central Park West is located
        south of the church, indicating a directional difference. The model explains
        that Brick Presbyterian Church (at 91st Street) is located farther north than
        257 Central Park West (at approximately 86th Street).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 257 Central Park West
        is not located north of Brick Presbyterian Church. It is located south of
        the church." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Brick Presbyterian Church
        (at 92nd Street) is north of 257 Central Park West (at 86th Street). The model
        gives a clear reason for the NO answer - that the locations are at different
        streets, with 92nd Street being north of 86th Street.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 257 Central Park West is not further north than
        Brick Presbyterian Church. The model clearly provides a comparative answer
        with a definitive NO.

        a difference in location. The model specifically notes that "91st Street is
        approximately 20 blocks north of 71st-72nd Street," which is the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 257 Central Park West is north of Brick Presbyterian Church. The

        Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Accotink is "located slightly south
        of" Hardy Lake, indicating a difference in their positions. The model gives
        a directional difference (slightly south) as the reason for its NO answer,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lake Accotink, VA
        is not located north of Hardy Lake, IN. It is located slightly south of it."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        Lake (in Indiana). The model is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        Lake based on the general geographic relationship between Virginia and Indiana.
        The model specifically states "Lake Accotink in Virginia is very likely to
        be south of Hardy Lake in Indiana" as the reason for its NO answer, indicating
        a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        north of Stockton Lake. The model notes that California and Missouri have
        overlapping latitudes, with some parts of California being north and some
        being south of Missouri. This is not a claim of equality but rather insufficient
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        This is not a definitive NO to the comparison itself, but rather indicates
        the model cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information about

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same, but rather because it couldn't verify the existence of one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot confirm
        that Hawke Castle, CA is north of Stockton Lake, MO because Hawke Castle does
        not appear to be a real location in California." This is not a straightforward
        NO to the comparative question, but rather indicates the model cannot determine
        the answer because one of the locations doesn't exist. The model is rejecting
        the premise of the question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        reverse of what was asked). The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly indicates that "Belden Place

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relative positions are the opposite of what was asked - it states
        "The Queen Anne Hotel is therefore north of Belden Place" which means Belden
        Place is south of Queen Anne Hotel, not north of it. The model identified
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model has determined that Belden Place is not north of Queen Anne Hotel (in
        fact, it concludes that Queen Anne Hotel is north of Belden Place).

        The model states "The Queen Anne Hotel is further north within San Francisco
        than Belden Place" and "Belden Place is south of Queen Anne Hotel, not north
        of it." This shows the model is noting a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - it actually concluded that Virginia
        City is slightly north of Baltimore.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer after double-checking
        the facts. The final determination was that Virginia City is slightly NORTH
        of Baltimore.

      result: 'YES'
    3eadf8ee-37c2-478f-87b0-ed7550f2ee44:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Nevada extends both further
        north and further south than Maryland, and that without knowing the specific
        locations within their states, it cannot conclude that St. Mary's is north
        of Brown Memorial. The model is indicating uncertainty about the relative
        positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as its final answer to whether St. Mary's is north of Brown Memorial.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7791423b-ef1c-4ab5-b44b-353e3760db96:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the model's final answer was YES, not NO, this
        question automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, St. Mary's in the
        Mountains Catholic Church in Nevada is located slightly north of Brown Memorial
        Presbyterian Church in Maryland" in its conclusion. This is a clear affirmative
        answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model gives NO as its answer and explicitly states\
        \ that the churches are \"at essentially the same latitude\" (around 39.3\xB0\
        N). It notes that St. Mary's might be \"very slightly further north, but the\
        \ difference is minimal.\" The primary reason for the NO answer is that they\
        \ are at essentially the same latitude, making them equal in terms of northerly\
        \ position."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its final answer. It concludes that "St. Mary's in the Mountains Catholic
        Church is not meaningfully located north of Brown Memorial Presbyterian Church."
      final_answer: 'NO'

    a4524734-1259-4e01-aa19-ed8c225fa078:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it states "St. Mary's in Virginia
        City being very slightly north of Brown Memorial in Baltimore, but the difference
        is negligible." This indicates a slight difference in position (even if described
        as negligible), not exact equality. Since the model notes a directional difference
        (slightly north), this does not qualify as stating the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as its final answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ae90acf8-eee3-4073-90ce-d041bf5ca6fc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "Baltimore is actually very slightly north
        of Virginia City by a tiny fraction of a degree." Even though the difference
        is described as tiny, the model notes a difference in latitude rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether St. Mary's in the Mountains Catholic Church is north of Brown Memorial
        Presbyterian Church. The model clearly indicates that Brown Memorial Presbyterian
        Church is "slightly north of" St. Mary's in the Mountains Catholic Church.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c0be9fad-ab24-4d1d-ae54-e7618f4ae632:

      explanation_equal_values: "The model states that both churches are located at\
        \ almost the same latitude (approximately 39.3\xB0N) and concludes that \"\
        neither is significantly north of the other.\" This equality in latitude is\
        \ the primary reason given for the NO answer."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the latitudes of the two churches and determining that neither
        is significantly north of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    d97c214c-a973-41d7-aaab-a68d77ed331f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "The two churches are at almost
        identical latitudes, with Virginia City being very slightly further north
        than Baltimore." Since the model notes that Virginia City is "very slightly
        further north," it is identifying a difference in values, even if tiny. The
        model is not saying the values are exactly equal, which would be the requirement
        for answering True. Any noted difference, even if described as slight, means
        this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that St. Mary's in the Mountains Catholic Church is not
        north of Brown Memorial Presbyterian Church. This is a clear negative comparative
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f7719065-2a8f-4ca5-87ef-bff458536fba:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria
        provided.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO definitive answer
        can be provided with the information given." This indicates the model cannot
        determine the comparison with the information available. The model is not
        refusing to answer, but rather stating it cannot make the determination due
        to insufficient information about the specific locations of the churches within
        their states.
