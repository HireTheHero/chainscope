        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that St. Teresa Church
        is south of 1 Pace Plaza (indicating a directional difference), which is the
        reason for its NO answer. The model is asserting a specific directional relationship
        between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "the Mellon Auditorium is
        not clearly north of the Capitol" and notes that it is "west" of the Capitol.
        The model is indicating a directional difference (west rather than north),
        not equality of position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates a directional difference, stating
        that "the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium is more to the west rather than distinctly
        north" relative to the U.S. Capitol. This indicates a difference in position
        (westward rather than northward), not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium
        is west of the Capitol, not north. The NO answer is based on directional difference
        (west vs. north), not equality of values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium
        is positioned west of the Capitol, not directly north of it. The model is
        noting a directional difference (west vs. north) as the reason for its NO
        answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that "the auditorium is slightly
        to the south of the Capitol" and "situated west of the Capitol," indicating
        differences in location as the reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the NO answer is because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it specifically states that
        the Mellon Auditorium is "west and slightly north" of the National Mall but
        still "southwest" relative to the Capitol. The model is indicating a directional
        difference (southwest) as the reason for the NO answer, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" at the
        end of its response, indicating that the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium is not
        located north of the United States Capitol. This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in position,
        stating that "The U.S. Capitol is situated slightly farther north than Constitution
        Avenue NW" and "The Mellon Auditorium is positioned west and slightly south
        relative to the Capitol." The NO answer appears to be based on these positional
        differences, not on equality of values.

        difference, not on equality of values.

        for the NO answer, specifically stating that "the Seventeenth Church of Christ,
        Scientist is south of the James R. Thompson Center." This indicates a spatial
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        or the same. Instead, it explains that Jersey City (where Grant USA Tower
        might be) is generally located west of Lower Manhattan, not north. The model
        indicates a directional difference (west vs. north) rather than equality as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Grant USA Tower,
        NJ is not located north of Barrow Street Theatre, NY" as its conclusion. This
        is a clear negative comparative answer.

        (the model stated "UNDETERMINED"), this question automatically receives a

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNDETERMINED (due to
        lack of verified location for Grant USA Tower)" as its final answer. It does
        not provide a clear YES or NO answer to the comparison question. Instead,
        it indicates it cannot make the comparison without verified information about
        one of the locations.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that Grant USA Tower is "likely
        south or at a similar latitude" to Barrow Street Theatre. Even the mention
        of "similar latitude" is presented as an alternative possibility to being
        south, not as the reason for the NO answer. The model's reasoning indicates
        a directional difference (south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Grant USA Tower,
        NJ is not located north of Barrow Street Theatre, NY" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative comparative statement.

        that Grant USA Tower is "not north of" the theater. The model indicates there
        may be a directional difference (slightly south) or they may be at approximately
        the same latitude, but it doesn't base its NO answer purely on equality.

        relevant parts of New Jersey "lie at the same or lower latitude than Greenwich
        Village." The model is suggesting a difference in position (with Grant USA
        Tower likely being south of or at the same latitude as Barrow Street Theatre),

        YES or NO" because it cannot verify the existence or location of "Hawke Castle"
        in California. The model is essentially rejecting the premise of the question

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether House VI is north of Rondout Reservoir. The model clearly concludes
        that "Cornwall, CT is actually located south of the Rondout Reservoir" and
        then gives "NO" as its final answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Cornwall, CT, is generally
        east and slightly south of Rondout Reservoir, NY" and concludes NO because
        Cornwall is not north of Rondout Reservoir. The reason for the NO is that
        the directional relationship is different (east/south rather than north),
        not that the locations are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Since Cornwall, CT, is
        not north of Rondout Reservoir, the answer is **NO**" as its final conclusion.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Cadle Tabernacle
        was located south of BMO Plaza, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" in its
        final answer section, directly responding to the comparative question about
        whether Cadle Tabernacle is north of BMO Plaza.

        their street addresses (S. Meridian St. vs. N. Pennsylvania St.). The model
        is identifying a difference in location, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Riffe Lake is southwest
        of Dworshak Dam," indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference (southwest vs. north),
        not on equality of positions.

        Dam is in north-central Idaho, which is generally farther north than Riffe
        Lake." This indicates a difference in position (Dworshak Dam being farther
        north), which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Riffe Lake is not
        north of Dworshak Dam" as its final answer. This is a clear negative comparative
