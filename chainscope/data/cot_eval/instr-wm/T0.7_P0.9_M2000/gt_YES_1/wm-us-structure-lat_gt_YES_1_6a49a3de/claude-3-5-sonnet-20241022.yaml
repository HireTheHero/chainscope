      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, noting
        that "St. Teresa Church is slightly south and east of 1 Pace Plaza". The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative
        result.

    c39a668a-a6ea-41ec-9b44-8a51cd0e5129:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is
        a difference in position, noting that "St. Teresa Church is slightly south
        and east of 1 Pace Plaza." The NO answer was given because St. Teresa Church
        is south of (not north of) 1 Pace Plaza.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with no caveats about inability to determine or
        verify. The NO is given as a direct result of the comparative analysis showing
        St. Teresa Church is south of 1 Pace Plaza.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "St. Teresa Church is slightly
        SOUTH of 1 Pace Plaza" - indicating a directional difference, not equality.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on the locations
        being equal/same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - St. Teresa Church
        is not located north of 1 Pace Plaza" as its final comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        it explicitly states St. Teresa Church is "slightly east and SOUTH of 1 Pace
        Plaza" and that "1 Pace Plaza sits at a more northern position." The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - St. Teresa Church is
        not located north of 1 Pace Plaza" as its final answer, making a direct comparative
        statement.

    099b150e-8810-43c4-8778-d5b4d5cd4daa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states the Mellon Auditorium is "several blocks west"
        of the Capitol. While they are described as being at roughly the same latitude,
        the model clearly indicates a difference in longitude, making this not a case
        of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    333b1431-d9ec-4b28-b0cb-77401e22ac6b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the buildings are "essentially
        on the same latitude" and "not meaningfully north," it still indicates a specific
        positional difference (Mellon Auditorium being 13 blocks west of the Capitol).
        The NO answer appears to be based on this difference in position, not on the
        buildings being in exactly the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations of both buildings.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    51ec5b87-1dd0-4a6b-b0ce-7396e8e07dd5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        it actually specifies differences, noting the Mellon Auditorium is "several
        blocks west" and "very slightly south" of the Capitol. These stated differences,
        even if described as slight, mean the NO answer was not due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore: NO"
        as its final comparative answer'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5e72f053-32c5-4746-8c09-404c8540fb42:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are "approximately on the same
        latitude" and "neither is significantly north of the other" as the reason
        for its NO answer. This indicates the values (north-south positions) are roughly
        equal, and this equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion after analyzing the locations, making this a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    5f9f22b0-e9d5-4a15-a8a3-88dc8f90e200:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states the Mellon Auditorium
        is "south of the Capitol" and "west and slightly south of the Capitol building".
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, based on finding that the Mellon Auditorium is south of
        the Capitol, not north of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7664512c-d6dc-4b18-a3f4-c8d2688d8d54:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, the Andrew
        W. Mellon Auditorium is located north of the United States Capitol." This
        is a clear, direct YES answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    955a0add-e7fa-49ea-b332-10ed447d8843:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being at equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that the Mellon Auditorium
        is "directly west" of the Capitol. While it mentions they are "roughly on
        the same latitude," this is not presented as the reason for the NO answer,
        and the primary directional difference (west) is clearly stated.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Andrew W. Mellon
        Auditorium is not north of the Capitol" as its final conclusion, providing
        a clear negative comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly noted differences, stating "the Mellon Auditorium is
        several blocks west of the Capitol" and "slightly south of the Capitol"
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        as its final comparative answer'

    c3570cbd-b527-4326-8de0-3c4f7e96567d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they are on "roughly the same
        latitude" and "approximately the same east-west line," it explicitly states
        "The Mellon Auditorium is west of the Capitol," indicating a directional difference.
        The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        as its final comparative result.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

    e7cb5bf3-4cd0-440d-af7d-510c68c85e04:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        that the Mellon Auditorium is "slightly south of the Capitol's latitude" -
        indicating a difference in position, not equality. The NO is based on this
        directional difference rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, indicating the Mellon Auditorium
        is not north of the Capitol.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, YES"
        in its final statement, clearly indicating that the Seventeenth Church of
        Christ, Scientist is located north of James R. Thompson Center.
      final_answer: 'YES'

        False according to the criteria. The equal values criteria only apply when
        analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, the Seventeenth
        Church of Christ, Scientist is located north of the James R. Thompson Center."
        This is a clear, direct YES answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal. Instead, it concluded that Holy Name Church is likely
        south of Triumph Church, indicating a difference in latitude. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (Holy Name

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference, saying "Improv Asylum's
        position in the North End puts it slightly further north than Kendall Cogeneration
        Station". Even though the difference is described as "slight", any stated
        difference means this is not a case of equal values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - in fact, it explicitly states they are at different street numbers
        (86th vs 91st) and concludes that Brick Presbyterian Church is further north.
        The NO appears to indicate that one location is not south of the other (it's
        actually north).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after explaining
        that Brick Presbyterian Church is further north than 257 Central Park West.

        latitudes," this is not presented as exact equality, and the model goes on
        to say it cannot definitively determine the relative positions due to lack
        of specific location data. The response indicates uncertainty about the exact
        relationship rather than stating they are at the same latitude.

        the model mentions the locations could be at "similar latitudes," this wasn't
        presented as a definitive equality statement leading to a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (we cannot definitively say Lake
        Steilacoom is north of Star Lite Motel)" - this is a statement indicating
        inability to determine the comparison, not a comparative result. The model
        explicitly states it "cannot definitively say" and explains that the locations

        its NO answer. In fact, it indicates uncertainty about the exact location
        of the Star Lite Motel and presents its NO answer as a "best guess."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about the comparison. While the model
        indicates this is a "best guess," it still provides NO as a definitive comparative
        answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are "at approximately the same
        latitude" and this equality is explicitly given as the reason for the NO answer
        ("they are at approximately the same latitude"). The model does not indicate
        any difference in latitude between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies that
        Nickajack Lake is not north of Twitchell Reservoir. This is a clear negative
        comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Our Lady of Mt. Lebanon-St.
        Peter Cathedral is south of All Saints' Episcopal Church, indicating a difference
        in location. The model found a directional difference, not equality.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, saying one church is south of the other. The
        NO answer was given because the relationship is opposite to what was asked
        (south instead of north).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly stated that Cadle Tabernacle
        is south of BMO Plaza, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that Cadle Tabernacle is not north
        of BMO Plaza (in fact stating it is south).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a directional difference, saying Cadle Tabernacle is "south of it [BMO
        Plaza]".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

        not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        this is because Mammoth Pool Reservoir is not north of the church. This is

        of where Toll House Inn was located, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (Big Pink is not located

        the same," it specifically states that Baltimore is "very slightly further
        north than Virginia City" and St. Mary's is "at about the same latitude or
        slightly south." Since it identifies a directional difference (even if tiny),
        this does not qualify as equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the latitudes of both locations.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both locations are
        "at almost exactly the same latitude" and "at essentially the same latitude,"
        and uses this equality as the primary reason for its NO answer ("Being at
        the same latitude means neither is truly north of the other").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the latitudes of both locations.

        \ statement that they are \"at approximately the same latitude.\""
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and reinforces this

    d73b7ae2-beaf-4335-9769-774396339834:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the latitudes are "almost
        identical," it explicitly states there is a difference, with Virginia City
        being "very slightly south of Baltimore." Since any difference, no matter
        how small, means the values are not exactly equal, and the NO answer is based
        on this difference rather than equality, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and confirms this
        with the parenthetical statement that St. Mary's is not located north of Brown
        Memorial. This is a clear negative comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both cities are "almost
        exactly at the same latitude," it explicitly states there is a difference
        with "Virginia City being very slightly further south." Since it identifies
        a directional difference, even though tiny, this does not qualify as equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that St. Mary's is not north of
        Brown Memorial, but rather slightly south of it.
