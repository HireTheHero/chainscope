        of 1 Pace Plaza, not that the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "YES" as its final answer.
        After analyzing the locations of both St. Teresa Church in Washington Heights
        (563 West 187th Street) and 1 Pace Plaza in Lower Manhattan, the model concludes
        that St. Teresa Church is north of 1 Pace Plaza.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that St. Teresa Church
        is southeast of 1 Pace Plaza, indicating a directional difference. The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer is based on this directional difference (southeast
        vs. north), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, St. Teresa Church (Manhattan)
        is not located north of 1 Pace Plaza" as its final answer. This is an explicit
        NO response to the comparative question.

        are exactly equal or identical. Instead, it states that the buildings are
        "approximately at the same latitude" and that the Mellon Auditorium is "primarily
        west of the Capitol, not north of it." The model indicates there is a directional
        difference (west rather than north) rather than claiming the locations are

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot confirm
        that Hawke Castle, CA is located north of Stockton Lake, MO because I cannot
        verify the existence or location of Hawke Castle in California." This is a
        case where the model is rejecting the premise of the question by stating it

        north of Stockton Lake, MO." This is a rejection of the premise rather than
        a claim of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        I cannot confirm that Hawke Castle, CA is north of Stockton Lake, MO because
        I cannot establish its existence or location." This is a case where the model
        says "NO" but is actually indicating it cannot determine the answer due to

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Beverly Hills (where All
        Saints' Episcopal Church is located) is positioned north of the Mid-Wilshire
        district (where the cathedral is located). The model concludes that the cathedral
        is south of the church, not that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model is confident in this answer, stating
        "Our Lady of Mt. Lebanon-St. Peter Cathedral is NOT north of All Saints' Episcopal
        Church" followed by "NO" as its final conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "All Saints' Episcopal
        Church in Beverly Hills is positioned further north than Our Lady of Mt. Lebanon-St.
        Peter Cathedral" and "All Saints' is located north of the cathedral." The
        model is clearly indicating a difference in the north-south positioning of
        the two buildings.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Our Lady of Mt. Lebanon-St. Peter Cathedral is located north of
        All Saints' Episcopal Church. The answer is explicitly stated at the end of
        the response.

        Church in Beverly Hills is positioned north of Our Lady of Mt. Lebanon-St.
        Peter Cathedral in Los Angeles. The model is indicating a directional difference
        (one is north of the other), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the geographical
        relationship between the two locations, not because they are equal or the
        same. The model specifically states that the cathedral is "positioned south
        of All Saints' Episcopal Church in Beverly Hills, not north of it." The model
        indicates a directional difference (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Our Lady of Mt. Lebanon-St. Peter Cathedral

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality. The model explains that the cathedral is south of the church
        (not north of it), because the cathedral is south of Wilshire Boulevard while
        the church is north of Wilshire Boulevard. The model is stating there is a
        clear directional difference between the two locations, not that they are
        equal or the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gave a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Our Lady of Mt. Lebanon-St. Peter Cathedral
        is southeast of All Saints' Episcopal Church, not north of it." The model
        specifically indicated a directional difference (southeast vs. north).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response: "# Answer: NO". The model determined that
        Our Lady of Mt. Lebanon-St. Peter Cathedral is not north of All Saints'' Episcopal

        Peter Cathedral is in a more southern position while All Saints' Episcopal
        Church is in a more northern position. The model gives a directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
