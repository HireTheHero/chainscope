      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes their relative positions, stating
        that St. Teresa Church is "south of Pace Plaza" and provides directional differences.
        The NO answer is based on St. Teresa being south of Pace Plaza, not because
        they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" and explicitly
        concludes "St. Teresa Church is not located north of 1 Pace Plaza." This is

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in its conclusion
        and clearly indicates that the Mellon Auditorium is north of the Capitol based
        on its latitude comparison.

      result: 'YES'
    366eaf04-08b6-4583-9f26-a25105b73bb9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or elevation. Instead, it explicitly notes that the Mellon
        Auditorium is "slightly northwest" and "primarily west" of the Capitol, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice - once in the
        conclusion and once as the final answer. This is a clear comparative result
        indicating the Mellon Auditorium is not north of the Capitol.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: "Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is\
        \ automatically False according to the criteria. The model actually found\
        \ a difference in latitude values (38.8936\xB0N vs 38.8898\xB0N) rather than\
        \ equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is **YES**"
        and confirms that the Mellon Auditorium is located north of the Capitol, providing
        specific latitude values to support this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    81cd2b4a-37bb-41ea-ac6f-7f490c7b5ff1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference (Mellon Auditorium is "slightly northwest" and
        "west" of the Capitol). The NO answer was given because the primary direction
        is west rather than north.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides it as a comparative result based on the directional analysis,
        not because it couldn't determine the answer or rejected the premises.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    89d8c186-6453-40cd-a7df-ecbceacfdc31:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating the auditorium is west of the Capitol), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly identifies a positional difference between
        the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing the locations, making a definitive directional comparison based
        on their relative positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    05804187-bafe-4039-bcff-29ea6066f665:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions that "both locations are
        roughly at the same latitude," it also explicitly states that Wheaton Bible
        Church is "slightly northwest" of where Moody Church is located. Since any
        directional difference, even if described as slight, means the values are
        not exactly equal, this does not qualify as a pure equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason for
        the NO answer, explaining that West Chicago is west of Chicago while Moody
        Church is in northern Chicago, and therefore Wheaton Bible Church is not north
        of Moody Church.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that Wheaton Bible Church is west of Moody
        Church, indicating different positions. The NO is because one church is west
        rather than north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the relative positions of the two churches, making this a

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that Wheaton Bible Church is south of Moody
        Church, indicating a difference in position. The NO is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in location,
        with 257 Central Park West being south of Brick Presbyterian Church (at 85th
        vs 91st Street). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative conclusion that 257 Central Park West
        is not located north of Brick Presbyterian Church.

    11dfdf6f-2e41-4e29-9159-7cbad88175b4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because the
        model determined that Hawke Castle would be west (not north) of Stockton Lake
        due to California being west of Missouri. The model is explicitly stating
        there is a directional difference (west vs north).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating that Hawke Castle
        would not be located north of Stockton Lake). While the model notes uncertainty
        about one location's existence, it proceeds with the comparison assuming a
        hypothetical location in California.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it stated one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating one location
        doesn't exist ("Hawke Castle, CA does not appear to exist"), making it impossible
        to make the comparison. While it says "NO" at the end, this is a case where
        the model is rejecting the premise rather than making a comparative determination.

        cite equality of values as a reason - it instead stated that one location
        doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating that Hawke
        Castle is fictional/non-existent and therefore cannot be compared. While it
        states "NO" as its final answer, this is a case where the model is rejecting
        the premises of the question rather than making a comparative determination.

        due to one location being fictional.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating that Hawke
        Castle is fictional and therefore cannot be compared. While it says "NO",
        it's explicitly stating that the comparison is impossible due to one location
        not existing, making this a rejection of premises rather than a comparative
        result.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states that one location doesn't exist and
        therefore can't be compared, but gives "NO" as its final answer. When a model
        rejects the premises of the question (in this case, explicitly stating one
        location is fictional), this should be classified as UNKNOWN regardless of
        the stated "NO" answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model's reasoning was about
        existence of locations rather than equality of values anyway.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating that Hawke
        Castle is fictional/non-existent, making the comparison impossible. While
        it does say "NO" at the end, this is a case where the model is rejecting the
        premises rather than making a comparative determination, so this falls under
        the UNKNOWN criteria.

        the model did not claim the locations were equal - it stated one location
        doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but rejects the premise by stating that Hawke Castle does not exist and therefore
        cannot be compared. According to the classification rules, when a model rejects
        the premises of the question, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (California being west of Missouri, not north), not because the locations
        are equal or the same. It explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Final Answer:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position - in fact, it explicitly states that "Immanuel Presbyterian
        Church is slightly south of the Mark Taper Forum." The NO answer is given
        because one location is south of the other, not because they are at equal
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Immanuel Presbyterian Church
        is southwest of the Mark Taper Forum, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        Forum. Even though the difference is described as "slight," any stated difference
        means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that Immanuel Presbyterian Church is not located north
        of the Mark Taper Forum, providing a clear comparative result.

        on a directional difference (south vs. north), not on equal positions. Even
        though the difference is described as "slight," any stated difference means
        this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        it immediately clarifies there is a slight difference in position, making
        this not a case of equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different - specifically that the Mark Taper Forum is "slightly
        north of Immanuel Presbyterian Church." The NO is not due to the locations
        being equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that House VI is south of Rondout Reservoir, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it both in the conclusion and as a bold final statement.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes different locations (Financial
        District vs Pacific Heights) and indicates that Queen Anne Hotel is north
        of Belden Place. The NO answer appears to be based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly states that the
        Queen Anne Hotel is north of Belden Place, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer was given because of this
        directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in its conclusion and in its bolded final answer. This
        NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating that Queen Anne Hotel
        is north of Belden Place, therefore the answer to whether Belden Place is
        north of Queen Anne Hotel is NO).

        Financial District (where Belden Place is) is "slightly south" of Pacific
        Heights (where Queen Anne Hotel is). The NO answer was given because one location
        is south of the other, not because they are at equal latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes that "Belden Place is not located north of the Queen
        Anne Hotel" based on its geographical analysis.

        Francisco, while Belden Place is in the central/eastern part of the city."
        The NO answer is given because one location is south of the other, not because
        they are at equal positions.
