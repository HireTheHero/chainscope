        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
        The model never reached a conclusion about equality or inequality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a clear YES/NO conclusion about whether St. Teresa Church is north of 1 Pace
        Plaza. The model gets lost in details about cross streets and relative positions
        but doesn't make a final comparative determination. The response ends mid-thought
        without providing a definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The question of
        equal values is not relevant since it wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" multiple times as
        its final answer, both after the thinking process and in the formal answer
        section, concluding that St. Teresa Church is north of 1 Pace Plaza based
        on latitude comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, even in the tentative
        "NO" consideration, it was based on relative positions (one being further
        north than the other), not on the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-thought without providing
        a clear YES/NO conclusion. While it explores various geographical details
        and street layouts, it never reaches a definitive answer. At one point it
        suggests "NO" but then immediately doubts itself ("Hence, the answer would
        be NO... But wait, maybe I have the streets mixed up") and continues deliberating
        without reaching a final conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this question
        is automatically False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: YES" at the

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The question
        of equal values is not relevant since there was no definitive NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        actually provides a clear YES/NO answer. While it seems to lean towards "yes"
        near the end ("so it would be north. If that's the case, then the answer is
        yes"), this is presented as hypothetical ("Suppose the Mellon Auditorium is
        at...") and ends with "But I need to confirm" without making a final determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" twice - once after
        its thinking process and again in its final summary. It clearly concludes
        that the Mellon Auditorium is north of the Capitol, providing specific latitude
        coordinates and other evidence to support this conclusion.

        The model never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive analysis but never
        reaches a definitive YES/NO conclusion. It repeatedly considers different
        scenarios and approaches (coordinates, ZIP codes, mental maps) but ends with
        uncertainty, using phrases like "depends" and "might be." The response actually
        gets cut off mid-sentence without providing a final answer.

        of equal values is not relevant since there wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive analysis but never

        (saying "if it's in Hoboken, then YES. If in Jersey City, NO" and similar
        conditional statements), it never commits to a final answer. The response

        ("perhaps the answer is YES", "but perhaps the answer is NO") and ends mid-sentence
        without making a final determination. The response shows uncertainty about
        the location of Grant USA Tower and considers multiple scenarios without reaching

        although it determines 257 CPW is at ~85th St, it never makes a final YES/NO
        determination because it remains uncertain about the church's location. The
        response ends mid-thought without providing a clear answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    3852bdd6-d217-4b6d-a77c-4d0538ccd7df:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in location, with 257 CPW being at 76th-77th Streets and the church being
        at 92nd Street, making them clearly different locations. The NO answer was
        given because 257 CPW is south of the church, not because they are at the
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that 257 CPW is south
        of the church. The answer is given both in the one-word response and explained
        in detail in the step-by-step explanation.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3f3956dd-a4fb-4a24-b72c-5bf3df2dd994:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that 72nd Street (where 257 CPW is) is south of 91st Street (where the church
        is), indicating a clear difference in position. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative conclusion that 257 CPW is south of (not north
        of) the church. The answer is given definitively without qualifications about
        uncertainty.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    69b3bca4-6982-4de2-9a8a-ce1beb0b607d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a difference in
        locations - specifically that 257 Central Park West is at 85th Street while
        the church is at 92nd Street. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (south vs north) and does not claim the locations are equal or
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative explanation that 257 Central Park West is
        south of the church, making this a clear negative comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    96aae3a2-7da7-4c8b-bfcb-b12805038c96:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same place. Instead, it explicitly states there is
        a directional difference - the church is at 91st Street which is north of
        257 CPW's location at 81st-82nd Streets. The NO answer was given because one
        location is definitively north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation confirming that 257 Central Park
        West is not north of the church because the church is at 91st Street which
        is north of 257 CPW's location at 81st-82nd Streets.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c0da131d-8605-4970-9a65-f82d058cf29f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a difference in
        street numbers (85th vs 92nd), not because the locations are at the same position.
        The model explicitly states that 257 CPW is south of the church, indicating
        a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, 257 is south
        of the church. So, the answer is NO, 257 Central Park West is not north of
        the Brick Presbyterian Church." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c12f13dd-dcd0-4811-aa39-407717e93741:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model was considering different
        possibilities but never reached a definitive NO answer based on equal values
        or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-thought without providing
        a clear final answer. While it considers multiple possibilities (church at
        88th St suggesting NO, church at 62nd suggesting YES), it never commits to
        a final conclusion. The response shows uncertainty about the church's location
        and ends without resolving the contradiction.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    e03f2ee3-aac1-4944-b9ed-1cc69851935e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While the model
        does work through calculations suggesting the locations might be at similar
        cross streets (85th-86th), it never reaches a final NO conclusion based on
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence
        with "If 200") and does not reach a final YES/NO conclusion. While the model
        works through various calculations and reasoning, it never explicitly states
        a final comparative answer about whether 257 CPW is north of the church.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but ends
        with "perhaps the answer is YES" without making a definitive statement. While
        it leans towards YES in the final sentence, it's still presented as tentative
        ("perhaps") rather than a clear assertion. The response shows significant

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        N)\") but never used this as justification for a final NO answer."
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion.
        It explores multiple scenarios and possibilities (like if the plant is in
        Indiana vs Illinois, different latitudes) but doesn't commit to a final answer.
        The response ends mid-thought while looking up coordinates for Gibson City,
        IL. The model appears confused about the premise (whether the plant is in
        Illinois or Indiana) and never makes a definitive comparative statement.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        - that BMO Plaza is north of Washington Street while Cadle Tabernacle is south
        of Washington Street, making them different in location. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on
        the relative positions of the two buildings (with BMO Plaza being north of
        Cadle Tabernacle).

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        Cadle Tabernacle was south of BMO Plaza, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the two locations (one being south of Washington Street, the other
        being north of it).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative directional explanation that Cadle Tabernacle is south of BMO
        Plaza, not north of it. The answer is definitive and based on relative positions.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
