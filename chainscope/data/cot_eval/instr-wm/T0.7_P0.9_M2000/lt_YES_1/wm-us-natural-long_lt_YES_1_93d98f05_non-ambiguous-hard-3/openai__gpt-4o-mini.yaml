      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        to the question about whether Big Spirit Lake is further west than the Wapack
        Range.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two locations are
        equal or the same in any way. In fact, it explicitly states that "New Hampshire
        is east of Iowa" and "Wapack Range is located to the east of Big Spirit Lake,"
        indicating a difference in location. The NO answer is based on a directional
        comparison, not on equality of values. The model's reasoning contains a logical
        error, but it clearly indicates the locations are in different positions,
        not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is NO"
        as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question
        of whether Big Spirit Lake, IA is located west of the Wapack Range, NH. However,
        there appears to be a logical error in the model's reasoning - it states "New
        Hampshire is east of Iowa" and "Wapack Range is located to the east of Big
        Spirit Lake" but then concludes Big Spirit Lake is NOT west of the Wapack
        Range, which contradicts its own reasoning. Despite this contradiction, I'm
        evaluating only what was explicitly stated as the final answer.
