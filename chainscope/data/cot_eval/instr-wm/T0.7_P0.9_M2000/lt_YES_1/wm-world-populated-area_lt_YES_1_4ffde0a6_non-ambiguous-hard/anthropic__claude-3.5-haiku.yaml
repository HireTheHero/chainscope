        model did not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"I cannot confidently\

    72a463da-8de9-4cea-8cf5-cf68afd315bd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are the same. In fact, it explicitly stated the opposite - that Yunnan province
        (394,000 square kilometers) is much larger than Liuyang city (2,200 square
        kilometers). The model's reasoning contains a contradiction, as it first establishes
        that Yunnan is larger but then concludes that Liuyang does NOT have a smaller
        area. However, nowhere does the model claim the areas are equal or the same,
        which would be required for a "True" answer to this question.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model''s final answer is explicitly stated as
        "Answer: NO" at the end of the response. However, there appears to be a contradiction
        in the model''s reasoning. In steps 3 and 4, the model states that Yunnan
        is much larger than Liuyang, but then in step 5 and the final answer, it concludes
        that "Liuyang does NOT have a smaller area than Yunnan" and answers "NO".
        This is contradictory, but I must analyze what was explicitly stated, not
        what is factually correct. The model clearly gave "NO" as its final answer.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
