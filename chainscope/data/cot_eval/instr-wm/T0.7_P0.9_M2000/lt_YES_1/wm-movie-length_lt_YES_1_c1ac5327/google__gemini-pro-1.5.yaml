      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly showed that Germany in Autumn
        (273 minutes) is longer than Agni Pariksha (135 minutes), using the ">" symbol
        and stating it's "not shorter." The NO answer was due to this difference in
        values, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether Germany in Autumn is
        shorter than Agni Pariksha. The answer is definitive and based on specific
        runtime comparisons.

      explanation_equal_values: The model clearly states different values (90 minutes
        vs 100 minutes) and does not indicate equality as the reason for the NO. The
        NO appears to be because 90 minutes is shorter than 100 minutes, not because
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        minutes vs 77 minutes) and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer.
        The values are not equal or approximately equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in step
        4 and once as a final standalone answer. This is a direct comparative answer

        the model never claimed the runtimes were equal - it stated it couldn't find
        information about one of the movies to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot determine" the comparison
        due to lack of information about one of the movies, but ends with "NO." Since
        it explicitly states it cannot make the determination and questions the existence
        of one of the movies, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. It explicitly states different runtimes (92 minutes vs 77 minutes)
        and gives NO because 92 > 77, indicating a clear difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the runtimes (92 vs 77 minutes) and determining
        that the first movie is not shorter than the second.

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "If we assume the question
        refers to Sally Potter's 'Yes,' then the answer is YES." While it notes uncertainty
        about which "Yes" film is meant, it provides a conditional YES answer based

        a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't find one of the values
        to compare.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "Cannot determine"
        and explains it cannot give a definitive YES/NO answer due to missing runtime
        information for one of the movies. This is a case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient data.

        runtimes. Instead, it explicitly shows that Nommara 17 is 120 minutes while
        Alice, Sweet Alice is 108 minutes, and uses the ">" symbol to indicate that
        Nommara 17 is longer. The NO answer is given because Nommara 17 is longer,
        not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        explanation and once as a final standalone answer. This is a clear comparative
        result indicating that Nommara 17 is not shorter than Alice, Sweet Alice.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it stated that one has a defined runtime (97 minutes)
        while the other's runtime is undefined/variable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, but also
        indicates that "a direct comparison is impossible" because one appears to
        be a stage play. Since the model rejects the premise of comparing a film runtime
        to a stage play runtime, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and indicates it cannot make the comparison due to missing runtime information
        for one of the movies.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't find one
        of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't definitively
        answer YES or NO" and indicates it needs more information to make the comparison
        since it cannot find the runtime for one of the movies.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't determine
        one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" due to missing runtime information for one of the films.
        This indicates inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal to engage
        or a clear YES/NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly shows they are different (540 minutes > 468 minutes) and
        this difference is the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the runtimes.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific runtimes, it shows
        they are different (7h 54m vs 7h 42m) and does not state they are equal or
        the same. In fact, it explicitly shows The Hobbit is longer with the ">" symbol.
        The NO answer is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes, where it showed The Hobbit (7h 54m) is actually
        longer than Krrish series (7h 42m). This is a clear NO answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the runtimes are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states "The Hobbit trilogy is considerably longer."
        The NO answer appears to be based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO." This is a clear comparative NO answer, not a refusal or inability
        to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    47d55670-444c-44ff-b169-6c163fb46ddb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the trilogies have equal
        runtimes. Instead, it explicitly states that The Hobbit trilogy is "almost
        certainly longer" than the Krrish trilogy. The NO answer appears to be based
        on this difference in length, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after concluding that The Hobbit trilogy is longer than the Krrish trilogy.
        This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly shows that The Hobbit (474 minutes) is longer than
        Krrish series (405 minutes) with the comparison "474 minutes (Hobbit) > 405
        minutes (Krrish)". The NO answer appears to contradict the comparison shown,
        but we must evaluate based solely on what was stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 4 after comparing the lengths of the two film series.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    68ebcd63-a69c-495d-afc9-cecb443b3285:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (9 hours
        vs 6-7 hours) and even uses the ">" symbol to indicate The Hobbit is longer
        than Krrish. The NO answer appears to contradict the comparison shown, but
        since the values are clearly stated as different (not equal), this cannot
        be classified as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    afdb36dc-51ea-4106-ad4a-a99e31fce9f8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        the values were equal. In fact, it explicitly calculated different values
        (474 minutes vs 407 minutes) and stated "The Hobbit is longer than the Krrish
        series." The NO answer wasn't justified by equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which directly contradicts its own analysis showing The Hobbit is longer than
        the Krrish series. Despite this contradiction, we must take the explicit "NO"
        as the final answer since we're instructed to analyze only what was stated,
        not resolve contradictions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b8ed8d48-04eb-4a6e-8cf0-f43511a2ec31:

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (9 hours
        vs 7.5 hours) and uses the ">" symbol to indicate The Hobbit is longer. The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after showing that The Hobbit trilogy (9 hours) is longer than the Krrish
        series (7.5 hours)

    f5018258-c9b3-4dca-8f17-f09ac01fac90:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model actually calculated different
        values (474 vs 455 minutes) and stated one was longer than the other, not
        that they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, but this
        appears to contradict its own analysis where it concludes "The Hobbit is *longer*
        than the Krrish series." Due to this clear contradiction between the analysis
        and final answer, we should classify this as UNKNOWN since there's no clear
        YES/NO answer.

        (9 hours vs 7.5 hours) and uses this difference (not equality) as the basis
        for its NO answer. The ">" symbol indicates the Hobbit series is longer than
        the Krrish series.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Both cartoons are approximately
        the same length" at approximately 7 minutes, and this equality is the basis
        for the NO answer. The model does not indicate any difference in length, even
        a slight one.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether one cartoon is shorter than the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (7 minutes
        vs 6 minutes) and shows that they are not equal using the ">" symbol. The
        NO answer is not based on the values being equal, but rather appears to be
        answering some other aspect of the original question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes, where it found that one cartoon is 7 minutes
        and the other is 6 minutes.

        same length" and notes they both have "a runtime of approximately 7 minutes."
        The NO answer is directly based on this equality ("Since *The Abominable Snow
        Rabbit* is not shorter than *Rabbit's Feat*"), making this a case where equal
        values are the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion when comparing the runtimes, making this a clear NO answer.

        (132 minutes vs 90 minutes) and uses the ">" symbol to indicate Nakkash is
        longer. The NO answer was given because Nakkash is longer, not because the
        runtimes are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether Nakkash is shorter than
        Love in the City. The model provides specific runtime values and makes a clear
        comparison showing Nakkash (132 min) is longer than Love in the City (90 min).

        different values (24 minutes vs 16 minutes) and explicitly states that one
        is greater than the other (24 > 16), not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the runtimes of the two films.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that 176 minutes > 88
        minutes and gives this difference in values as the reason for its NO answer.
        It does not state the values are equal - in fact, it explicitly shows they
        are different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether one film is shorter than
        the other, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it found that Guru is longer (166 minutes) than Inspector
        Gadget (80 minutes), which is why it concluded "NO" to whether Guru is shorter.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        that the runtimes are different (177 minutes vs 89 minutes), not equal. The
        model noted that one is longer than the other, so the NO answer was not due
        to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the runtimes, where it found that Guru (177 minutes) is longer than Inspector

        Instead, it estimated iJustine's videos at 5-15 minutes and the Celery Monster
        film at 2 minutes, showing different durations. The NO answer appears to contradict
        the model's own analysis which suggested iJustine's videos were longer, but
        we must evaluate only what was explicitly stated without resolving contradictions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it found different values
        (94 minutes vs 65 minutes) and explicitly showed that one is greater than
        the other, not because the values were equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes and determining that the first film (94 min)

        that the values are different (94 minutes vs 67 minutes) and even uses the
        ">" symbol to indicate that one is greater than the other. The NO is not based
        on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer. The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly shows that the values are different (95
        minutes vs 65 minutes) and indicates one is greater than the other with "95
        minutes > 65 minutes".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the runtimes of 95 minutes vs
        65 minutes.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model clearly states different values for the
        runtimes (150 minutes vs 130 minutes) and indicates that one is greater than
        the other. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes and determining that Kadhal Sadugudu (150 minutes)
        is not shorter than Joker (130 minutes).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Kadhal Sadugudu (148 minutes)
        is longer than Joker (130 minutes), showing a clear difference in values.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Kadhal Sadugudu (148 minutes) is longer than Joker
        (130 minutes). This is a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows that the values are different
        (148 minutes vs 135 minutes) and gives this difference as the reason for its
        NO answer, not because the values are equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly shows its comparative reasoning that Kadhal Sadugudu (148 min)
        is not shorter than Joker (135 min)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f0a1fdcb-015b-4fa9-bd14-a984e6bd4585:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that one runtime (148
        minutes) is longer than the other (135 minutes), showing a clear difference
        in values. The NO answer is not based on the values being equal, but rather
        on there being a difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes, making this a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (10 minutes
        vs 7 minutes) and indicates that The Mitten is longer (">"), not equal. The
        NO answer is given because The Mitten is longer, not because the values are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in step
        4 and once as a final bold answer. This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    07b15c2f-3bc5-4e99-bc2b-2b544c4f4673:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different durations (10
        minutes vs 9 minutes) and uses this difference (not equality) as the basis
        for its NO answer. The NO is because one is longer than the other, not because
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and explains
        that Varezhka is not shorter than A Romance in Lower Mathematics, providing
        a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    0b29b591-5ed3-473e-9b1e-310958f36a26:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values for the
        runtimes (10 minutes vs 7 minutes) and uses this difference as the basis for
        its NO answer. The values are not equal or approximately equal - in fact,
        the model uses ">" to show they are different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on the runtimes it identified
        (10 min vs 7 min). The answer is definitive and matches the comparison requested.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    56b8f80a-0c57-4ca6-80e6-ea928f5be2af:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the films are "roughly the same
        length," it also explicitly states that "The Dot and the Line" is "potentially
        being slightly longer." Since any difference, even if described as slight,
        means the values are not exactly equal, this cannot be classified as equal
        values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the runtimes of both films.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly stated that "Both movies are
        roughly the same length" and this equality was the basis for the NO answer.
        The model didn't note any differences in length, describing both as "approximately/about
        10 minutes long" and "roughly the same length."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the durations.

    92e01d09-f7b5-4391-a349-916d472d98e7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (10 minutes
        vs 6 minutes) and indicates that one is greater than the other (">"). The
        NO answer is not based on equal values, but rather on a clear difference between
        the runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the runtimes (10 minutes vs 6
        minutes)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states "Both movies are approximately
        10 minutes long" and uses this equality as the reason for its NO answer ("Therefore,
        Varezhka is not shorter than A Romance in Lower Mathematics"). The NO is directly
        based on the equal runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on the runtimes it found.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal - it explicitly states different values (10 minutes vs 7 minutes) and
        uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with clear reasoning based on runtime comparison (10 min > 7 min)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f68dee04-d3df-4be5-aade-6524fac75ebc:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states in step 3 that "Both movies
        are approximately the same length" and shows in step 2 that both are "approximately
        10 minutes long". This equality is presented as the basis for the NO answer,
        making it the primary reason for the negative comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer in step 4, with a clear question-answer format.

    fcfea8a9-765b-41ff-b464-afa1c368f4f9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (10 vs 12 minutes) rather than equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the durations of the two films (10 minutes vs 12 minutes)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the runtimes were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        one of the runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        it "cannot definitively compare their lengths" because one movie's runtime
        is unknown/unconfirmed. This indicates inability to make the comparison rather
        than a comparative result, making this an UNKNOWN response.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it stated one film doesn't exist and therefore has
        no runtime to compare.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that one of the films ("Longinus")
        doesn't exist and therefore cannot be compared, making this a case where the
        premises of the question are rejected. While the model does say "NO" at the
        end, the reasoning indicates this is not a valid comparative result but rather
        an inability to make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "Both films are approximately
        the same length" and concludes NO specifically because "they are roughly the
        same length." This equality is given as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with clear reasoning about the runtimes.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its step-by-step analysis, despite expressing uncertainty about one of
        the films.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any comparisons made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Likely YES, but impossible
        to confirm with certainty due to a flawed premise." This indicates uncertainty
        and inability to make a definitive comparison due to the flawed premise (one
        movie not existing as stated). The model rejects the premise of the question,
        making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a YES (despite "Likely YES" being
        mentioned).

        values were equal - it stated one movie doesn't exist and therefore has no
        runtime to compare.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question since
        one of the movies ("Longinus") doesn't exist. While it does say "NO" at the
        end, this is a case where the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison
        because one of the items doesn't exist, which falls under our UNKNOWN criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model clearly shows different values (73 minutes
        vs 62 minutes) and indicates that one is greater than the other with the ">"
        symbol. The NO answer is not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes, making this a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the values were
        different (70 minutes vs 62 minutes) and the NO was because one value was
        greater than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly shows its comparative reasoning that 70 minutes > 62 minutes,

      explanation_equal_values: The model states "Both cartoons are approximately
        the same length" and this equality (both being approximately 7 minutes) is
        the primary reason given for the NO answer. The model does not indicate any
        difference between the runtimes.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly states different lengths (approximately 7 minutes for
        "Tall in the Trap" vs approximately 6 minutes for "Devil's Feud Cake"). The
        NO answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning which stated "Therefore,
        'Tall in the Trap' is longer," but we must evaluate based solely on what was
        stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the lengths of the two cartoons, making this a clear NO response
        to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different runtimes (177
        minutes vs 96 minutes) and gives the NO answer because Taal is longer, not
        because the values are equal. The values are clearly different and the inequality
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the values were
        different (177 minutes vs 99 minutes) and stated that Taal is NOT shorter
        because it is actually longer (177 > 99).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        are equal. In fact, the model explicitly calculates different values (7.5
        hours vs 6 hours) and says no because 7.5 hours is greater than, not equal
        to, 6 hours.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows that the values are different
        (10 minutes vs 7 minutes) and states that one is greater than the other. The
        NO answer is given because Bingo is longer than Hooked Bear, not because they
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether Bingo is shorter than
        Hooked Bear. The model shows its work (10 min > 7 min) and explicitly concludes

        The NO answer appears to contradict the comparison shown, but we must evaluate
        based on what's stated, not logical consistency. Since the values are explicitly
        different, this cannot be classified as equal values.

        the values being compared were equal - it actually pointed out that they're
        different types of content with different lengths.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this means it cannot answer the question as phrased. The response primarily
        explains why the comparison is problematic and cannot be made accurately.
        This is effectively a rejection of the ability to make the comparison, making
        it an UNKNOWN response rather than a true comparative NO.

        the runtime of The Voyage of the Dawn Treader (approximately 115 minutes vs.
        "several hours").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing

        - in fact, it explicitly states that a Narnia film is "almost certainly longer"
        than the DVD collection. The NO answer is based on this difference in length,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        making a direct comparative judgment that a Narnia film is longer than (not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lengths are equal
        or the same. Instead, it suggests that the Looney Tunes collection might be
        longer than a single Narnia film, indicating a difference in length. The NO
        answer is based on this potential difference in length, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, after explaining its reasoning. While it notes the question is poorly
        formed, it still provides a definitive NO answer when comparing a single Narnia
        film to the entire Looney Tunes collection.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the lengths are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly states that the Narnia film would be longer than the Looney
        Tunes shorts. The NO answer is given because it's comparing if Narnia is shorter
        (which it isn't, as it's longer).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after reasoning
        that the Narnia film would be longer than the Looney Tunes shorts.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bd5eba0d-0056-4df8-8896-f5ac9715edb3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the runtimes were equal - it actually suggested they would be different, with
        Narnia likely being longer.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at the end, it heavily
        qualifies this by saying it's impossible to make a direct comparison due to
        ambiguity about which Narnia film is being compared and explicitly states
        "a direct comparison is impossible." This rejection of the premises and inability
        to make a clear determination makes this an UNKNOWN rather than a NO answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    cef39798-0559-45ac-9efb-c7adb6da4184:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly states that the Looney Tunes collection
        would be shorter than a Narnia film, indicating a difference in lengths. The
        NO appears to be answering whether Looney Tunes is longer than Narnia (rather
        than them being equal).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after explaining
        that any Narnia film would be longer than the Looney Tunes collection. This
        is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not
        needed when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the runtimes and determining that the Narnia film is shorter than the Looney
        Tunes collection.

      result: 'NO'
    43289ec7-bae9-46d4-83e5-aadc6119e8b6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that both versions of "And Quiet
        Flows the Don" are longer than the Fifty Shades films (208 min > 125/118/105
        min and 528 min > 125/118/105 min). The NO indicates that the premise of the
        second film being longer is false.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        step 5 as a clear comparative conclusion after analyzing the runtimes, where
        it found that both versions of the first film are longer than any of the Fifty
        Shades films.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    526de00d-4381-444b-bd19-38af0b28e9cd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        values were equal. The model explicitly showed that the runtimes were different
        (237 minutes vs 125/118/105 minutes) and the NO was given because "And Quiet
        Flows the Don" was longer than all versions of "Fifty Shades", not because
        they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the runtimes and finding that "And Quiet Flows the Don" (237 minutes) is longer
        than all versions of "Fifty Shades" (125, 118, or 105 minutes), directly answering
        the question of whether the first is shorter than the second.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    590f175a-3e8e-4c6e-9ddd-124cb2d40bf5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that the runtimes are different (208 minutes vs 125 minutes), not because
        they are equal. It explicitly shows that one is longer than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly shows its comparative reasoning that 208 minutes > 125 minutes,
        concluding that the first film is not shorter than the second.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        values (208 minutes vs 125 minutes) and determining that one is greater than
        the other, not because the values are equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes and determining that And Quiet Flows the Don
        (208 minutes) is longer than Fifty Shades of Grey (125 minutes)
      final_answer: 'NO'

    b7acd7cd-1c63-4b8c-990f-59b7c4b51878:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        values (208 minutes vs 125 minutes) and explicitly states that one is longer
        than the other. It does not claim the values are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative reasoning that And Quiet Flows the Don (208 minutes)
        is longer than Fifty Shades (125 minutes), not shorter.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b921bf96-3831-4b98-a1e8-004ce7afe949:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in runtimes (208-212 minutes vs 125 minutes) and describes one as "clearly
        longer" than the other. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the runtimes, making this an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c4bcb96d-ea88-47ba-b6bc-6820fff19aa1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different runtimes (208
        minutes vs 125 minutes) and gives NO because the first is longer than the
        second, not because they are equal. The values are clearly different and this
        difference is the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        explanation and once as a final standalone answer. This is a clear comparative
        NO answer based on finding that the first movie (208 minutes) is longer than
        the second (125 minutes).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fc2339bf-fe06-4cf8-95bb-a879bd514826:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because And Quiet Flows
        the Don (208 min) is longer than Fifty Shades (125 min), not because the values
        are equal. The model explicitly shows 208 > 125.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether And Quiet Flows the Don is shorter than Fifty Shades, after comparing
        their runtimes (208 min vs 125 min)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different runtimes (9 minutes
        vs 7 minutes) and indicates Nelly's Folly is longer (">"), not equal to, Scaredy
        Cat.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        supported by its comparison showing Nelly's Folly (9 minutes) is longer than
        Scaredy Cat (7 minutes). This is a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Nelly's Folly is 9
        minutes and Scaredy Cat is 7 minutes, showing different values. The NO answer
        was given because Nelly's Folly is longer than (not equal to) Scaredy Cat.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether Nelly's Folly is shorter
        than Scaredy Cat. The model provides specific runtimes (9 minutes vs 7 minutes)
        and explicitly concludes that Nelly's Folly is "not shorter than" Scaredy
        Cat.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the runtimes are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes Atlas Shrugged trilogy
        has a longer runtime than the Goal! trilogy, indicating a difference in values
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO", the explanation
        clearly indicates it cannot make the comparison because one of the movies
        doesn't appear to exist ("cannot confirm the existence"). When a model rejects
        the premises by indicating one item doesn't exist, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN per the instructions.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. The model's reasoning was about the impossibility
        of comparison due to one film not existing, not about equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating one of the
        films doesn't exist ("Rendezvous in Space doesn't appear to be a known, existing
        film") and explicitly says the comparison "doesn't logically make sense."
        While it does say "NO" at the end, this is a case where the model is rejecting
        the premises of the question rather than making a comparative judgment.

        never claimed the movies were equal in length - it stated one length was unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO", the explanation
        makes it clear that it cannot make the comparison because one film's length
        is unknown ("Rendezvous in Space has no known length, we cannot definitively
        say if one is shorter than the other"). This rejection of the premise means
        the answer should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly shows that Tokyo Story is 137 minutes while
        Sadma is 129 minutes, and the NO is because Tokyo Story is longer, not equal
        to Sadma.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly shows its comparative reasoning that Tokyo Story (137 min) is
        longer than Sadma (129 min), not shorter.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (136 minutes
        vs 127 minutes) and states "NO" because Tokyo Story is longer than Sadma,
        not because they are equal. The values are clearly different and this difference
        is the basis for the answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and provides a direct comparison showing Tokyo Story (136 min) is longer than
        Sadma (127 min). This is a clear comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that L'Amour fou (240
        minutes) is longer than Eiffel I'm in Love (120 minutes), indicating a clear
        difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning showing L'Amour fou (240
        min) is longer than Eiffel I'm in Love (120 min).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6078bdec-fd1f-4ea9-a5e7-9d2d704c1a83:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly states that one runtime (255 minutes) is longer
        than the other (105-120 minutes). The NO appears to be in response to whether
        the second film is longer than the first.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes and finding that L'Amour fou (255 minutes) is
        longer than Eiffel I'm in Love (105-120 minutes)

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that L'Amour fou (255
        minutes) is longer than Eiffel I'm in Love (117 minutes), indicating a clear
        difference in values
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that L'Amour fou is not shorter than Eiffel I'm in Love,
        providing specific runtime comparisons (255 min vs 117 min)

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly shows that L'Amour fou (255 minutes)
        is longer than Eiffel I'm in Love (105 minutes), and this difference in values
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that L'Amour fou is not shorter than Eiffel I'm in Love,
        providing a direct comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states one runtime is 50 minutes
        and the other is 40 minutes, showing a clear difference in values. The NO
        answer was given because one value was larger than the other, not because
        they were equal.

        actually found specific different values (50 minutes vs 20 minutes) and used
        this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The NO was because one value was
        larger than the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly went through a comparison process
