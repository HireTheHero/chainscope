      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both films have "the
        same runtime (7 minutes)" and this equality is directly given as the reason
        for the NO answer ("Since both films have the same runtime... is not shorter")

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that To Hare is Human (7 minutes) is longer than Baton Bunny (6 minutes),
        not because the values are equal. It explicitly states there is a difference
        in runtime.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative conclusion that To Hare is Human is longer than
        Baton Bunny, not shorter.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated different runtimes (6:46
        vs 6:30) and concluded that Baton Bunny was shorter than To Hare is Human
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after comparing the runtimes, where it found that Baton Bunny (6:30)
        is shorter than To Hare is Human (6:46)

    3cbf921f-c4c9-4731-8f1a-d10bab5088a6:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "both cartoons have
        the same approximate length of 7 minutes" and uses this equality as the primary
        reason for its NO answer ("since both cartoons have the same approximate length...
        one is not shorter than the other").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing if one film is shorter than the other.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states both films have "runtimes of around
        7 minutes" and concludes NO specifically because "neither is definitively
        shorter than the other" - indicating equality as the primary reason for the
        NO answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one film (7 minutes)
        is longer than the other (6 minutes). The NO was given because the relationship
        is in the opposite direction of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative reasoning that "To Hare is Human" is longer (not
        shorter) than "Baton Bunny"

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in
        length ("To Hare is Human is slightly longer than Baton Bunny") and this difference
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes and finding that To Hare is Human is slightly
        longer than Baton Bunny.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly states that To Hare is Human (7 minutes) is longer than
        Baton Bunny (6 minutes, 30 seconds). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in length, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, To Hare is Human
        is not shorter than Baton Bunny" as its final answer. This is a clear comparative
        NO.

    4ba0edad-2f73-40c1-9f6b-104ddc5fb65f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        values (~600 minutes vs ~560 minutes) and explicitly states that Sijjin is
        "longer" than Housefull. The NO is not due to equal values but rather because
        Sijjin is calculated to be longer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific runtime calculations to support its conclusion
        that Sijjin (~600 minutes) is longer than Housefull (~560 minutes).

    56f17f08-871a-4bbb-bd54-c4a00bad96e9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Sijjin has 6 movies
        while Housefull has 4 movies, and concludes that "6 movies are more than 4
        movies." The NO answer was given because one value was greater than the other,
        not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that Sijjin is not shorter than Housefull. This is a direct
        comparative answer to the question.

    6d038963-8582-437e-aba7-1843cfd66a64:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model calculates both series at ~600 minutes,
        it specifically notes that "Housefull might lean slightly longer due to Bollywood's
        tendency for lengthier films." Since it indicates a slight difference rather
        than exact equality, and this difference is part of the reasoning for the
        NO answer, this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer when comparing the series lengths.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the runtimes are "quite close,"
        it does not state they are exactly equal. In fact, it suggests that "Sijjin
        might be slightly longer or about the same length." Since it indicates a possible
        difference (slightly longer), this does not qualify as stating the values
        are exactly equal as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that "Sijjin is not shorter than the Housefull
        franchise"

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference, with Siccin being
        longer (625 minutes) than Housefull (575 minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Final Answer:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly calculates different total lengths (600 vs 580 minutes)
        and states that Sijjin is "slightly longer" than Housefull. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        length ("around the same length"), it doesn't explicitly state they are equal/identical.
        Instead, it states that the first film is "not significantly shorter than
        98 minutes" and likely falls in a range of 90-120 minutes, implying some difference
        may exist. The NO answer appears to be based on the first film not being shorter
        than the second, rather than on exact equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about one runtime,
        it does not state that the values are equal or the same. In fact, it acknowledges
        that the first film's runtime could be either shorter or longer than 98 minutes.
        The NO answer appears to be given due to insufficient evidence of the first
        film being shorter, not because the runtimes are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty about one of the values. Since
        it gives a clear NO answer (not saying it cannot determine or verify), this
        should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because 88 minutes
        is longer than 85 minutes, not because the values are equal. It explicitly
        states "88 minutes is longer than 85 minutes" and concludes NO because 88
        is "not shorter" than 85.

        to or longer than" The Pink Blueprint, and specifically mentions the possibility
        of it being "longer" if it's closer to 7 minutes. Since it presents a potential

        model did not claim the lengths were equal - it suggested they might be "comparable"
        but was uncertain.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating "Tex Avery
        did not have a specific collection under that name" and indicates uncertainty
        about the relative lengths being "comparable but not definitively shorter."
        This makes it a rejection of the premises/inability to determine rather than
        a clear comparative NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        in runtimes (125 vs 117 minutes) and gives this difference as the reason for
        the NO answer, not because the values are equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative analysis showing Pottu (125 minutes) is longer than

        the values were equal. In fact, it explicitly noted a difference, stating
        that "Pottu is longer than Games of Love and Chance" with specific different
        runtimes (125 vs 117 minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes, where it found Pottu (125 minutes) to be longer
        than Games of Love and Chance (117 minutes). This appears to be a clear NO
        answer to the comparison.

        the values are equal. The model explicitly states that 125 minutes is longer
        than 117 minutes, showing a clear difference in values. The NO answer is based
        on this difference (Pottu being longer), not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Pottu (125 minutes) is longer than Games of Love and
        Chance (117 minutes). This is a direct comparative answer to whether the first
        film is shorter than the second.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer is NO, this is not
        because the values are equal. The model explicitly states that 184 minutes
        is "longer than" 111 minutes and shows a clear difference between the runtimes
        (184 vs 111 minutes). The NO answer is given because one value is larger than
        the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with "Final Answer: NO." as its conclusion. This

        is longer than 111 minutes, not because the values are equal. It explicitly
        states "Satya Harishchandra is clearly longer than Red" and that "184 minutes
        is not shorter than 111 minutes" - indicating a difference in values, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that From Hare to Heir
        (7 minutes) is longer than Landing Stripling (6 minutes). The NO answer is
        not based on equal values - in fact, the model identifies a difference in
        runtime. Therefore, this cannot be classified as a NO due to equal values.
