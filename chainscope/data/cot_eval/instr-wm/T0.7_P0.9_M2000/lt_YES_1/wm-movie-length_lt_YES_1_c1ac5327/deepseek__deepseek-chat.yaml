      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (7 minutes
        vs 6 minutes) and indicates that one is longer than the other. The NO answer
        is given because of this difference, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating
        that "To Hare is Human is not shorter than Baton Bunny")

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different runtimes (7 minutes
        vs 6 minutes) and indicates that one is longer than the other
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different runtimes (7
        minutes vs 6 minutes) and bases its NO answer on "To Hare is Human" being
        longer, not on the values being equal. The values are clearly different, not
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        fact, it explicitly states that "Guru is significantly longer than Inspector
        Gadget" with specific different runtimes (165 minutes vs 78 minutes). The
        NO answer is based on Guru being longer, not on the values being equal.

        Gadget. The NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        - in fact, it explicitly states different runtimes (150 minutes vs 138 minutes)
        and uses these different values to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is
        given because one movie is longer than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        that "both films are likely the same length" and "their runtimes are very
        similar." The model states they are both "approximately 6-7 minutes long"

        (7 hours 30 minutes vs 4 hours 40 minutes) and explicitly stated that one
        was longer than the other. It did not give NO because the values were equal
        - in fact, it specifically noted the difference in lengths.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found a significant
        difference between the runtimes (350 minutes vs 140 minutes), explicitly stating
        "significantly longer than". It did not indicate the values were equal or
        the same - in fact, it emphasized their difference. Therefore, equality was
        not the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in bold and after a step-by-step analysis comparing the runtimes (350
        minutes vs 140 minutes). This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Both films are roughly the
        same length, with no significant difference in runtime" and gives equal values
        of 7 minutes for each. This equality is presented as the reason for the NO
        answer ("Since *Roman Legion-Hare* is not shorter than *Forward March Hare*,
        the answer is NO").

        the same length, with no significant difference in runtime" and notes both

        the same length" in its conclusion and notes "there is no significant difference
        in runtime between the two."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
