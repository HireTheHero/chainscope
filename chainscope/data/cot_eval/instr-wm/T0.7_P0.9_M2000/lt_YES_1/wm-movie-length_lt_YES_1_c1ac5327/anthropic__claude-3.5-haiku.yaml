      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        discussion of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer with certainty" and indicates it cannot make the comparison due
        to lack of information about the runtimes. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria
        as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both cartoons are "approximately
        6 minutes long" and "very similar in length," and this equality appears to
        be the primary reason for the NO answer. The model doesn't indicate any difference
        in length, even a slight one, but rather emphasizes their identical approximate
        runtime as the basis for concluding NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, my
        answer is: NO" after analyzing the runtimes. While it expresses some uncertainty

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both shorts have
        "the same runtime of 6 minutes" and directly uses this equality as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Since they are the same length, the answer is
        NO."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it both in the explanation and as a standalone answer
        at the end.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that the cartoons are "essentially
        the same length" (both approximately 6 minutes) and uses this equality as
        the primary reason for its NO answer. The model doesn't indicate any difference
        in length, only that they appear to be the same length and "Neither is definitively
        shorter than the other."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, my

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states "Since they are essentially
        the same length" and uses this equality (both being approximately 6 minutes
        long) as the primary reason for its NO answer. This matches the criteria for
        a True classification where equality is the main reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "Both shorts are
        essentially the same length" and "the runtimes are equal" as the reason for
        its NO answer. This equality is directly cited as why the statement is "technically
        false."

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both animations are
        "the same length (6 minutes)" and this equality is the primary reason given
        for the NO answer. The model doesn't note any differences in length, and the
        NO answer is directly based on them being the same length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, clearly stating that "To Hare is Human" is NOT shorter than "Baton
        Bunny".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the movies had equal lengths - it simply stated it couldn't verify the lengths
        to make a comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm the movie length
        comparison with certainty)" which indicates it cannot determine or verify
        the comparison. This is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot
        make the determination, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive
        NO comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        compared actual values or stated they were equal - it simply stated it lacked
        the information to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and acknowledges lack of information to make the comparison.
        This is a clear case of refusing to make the comparison due to insufficient
        data.

        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I DON'T KNOW" as its
        final answer and indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.
        This is a clear refusal to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer due to insufficient information" and "cannot definitively compare
        their runtimes." This is a clear indication that the model cannot make the
        comparison due to lack of data.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        discussion of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and explains it lacks concrete information to make the comparison.
        This is a clear refusal to make the comparison.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and "does not have enough information to answer this question."
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of whether any equality was mentioned (which it wasn't).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer" and "cannot answer this question with certainty" due to
        lack of runtime data. This indicates an inability to make the comparison rather
        than a refusal or definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a NO comparison or claimed the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and indicates it cannot verify the runtimes to make the
        comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot determine
        the answer.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the runtimes were equal - it simply stated it couldn't verify them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot confirm the runtime with certainty" and "cannot
        definitively state that one is shorter than the other." This indicates inability
        to determine rather than a comparative result, making this an UNKNOWN response.

        the runtimes were equal - it simply stated it lacked the data to make any
        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm the comparison

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a confident
        YES or NO answer" and then provides "NO" as a "conservative answer given the

        the comparison due to missing information about one film's runtime, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it simply stated it didn't know either value.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does provide "NO" as an answer, it
        explicitly states this is a guess and not a confident determination, and emphasizes
        throughout that it cannot definitively compare the lengths due to lack of
        information. The model essentially indicates it cannot make the comparison,
        which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (indicating I do not have confidence
        that the first film is shorter)" but this is explicitly framed as indicating
        uncertainty/inability to determine, not as a comparative result. The bulk
        of the response explains why it cannot make the comparison due to lack of

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the runtimes were equal - it stated it lacked data for one of the films.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this means it "cannot confirm" the comparison due to missing data. This is
        effectively stating it cannot determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN
        response rather than a definitive NO comparative result.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot definitively answer" due
        to lack of verifiable information about the videos/films, but then gives "NO"
        as its final answer. Since the model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        but still provides "NO", this should be classified as UNKNOWN per the criteria

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot actually verify the comparison ("I cannot
        verify the details") and is only saying NO as a default because it feels compelled
        to give a YES/NO answer. This makes it clear the model is indicating it cannot
        determine the answer, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the movies had equal lengths - it simply stated it couldn't
        verify the lengths.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot confirm the movie lengths" and "cannot assert"
        the comparison. This makes it clear that the NO is due to inability to determine/verify,
        not a comparative result, so this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result showing that one film is not shorter

        minutes) and gives NO because Varezhka is longer than the other film.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        and A Romance in Lower Mathematics is 7 minutes, with Varezhka being longer.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in length, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot verify" or
        determine the comparison due to lack of runtime information. While it does
        say "NO" at the end, it immediately clarifies this is not based on actual

        the model never claimed the films had equal lengths - it simply stated it
        lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        provide a YES or NO answer" but then adds a forced "NO (but with very low
        confidence)". Since the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due
        to missing information about one film's length, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

        equality as reason for NO when the final answer is definitively NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (unable to confirm it is shorter)"
        but this is explicitly qualified as being due to inability to verify, not
        as a comparative result. The model also directly states "I cannot definitively

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive

        shorter than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not

        that the model did observe the cartoons appear to be "very similar in length"
        at 6-7 minutes each.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually gives a "NO" answer, it
        explicitly states it "cannot confidently answer YES or NO" and emphasizes
        this is "not a high-confidence answer due to lack of precise runtime verification."

        answer is based on Hera Pheri having more content, not on the series being
        equal in length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and concludes "I do not have enough information to answer
        this question." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to
        lack of information.

        the runtimes were equal - it simply stated it didn't know the runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot confirm the runtime comparison." This is effectively
        stating it cannot determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN response rather
        than a true negative comparison.

        Instead, it explicitly states that Chow Hound is 7 minutes and There They
        Go-Go-Go! is 6 minutes, and concludes NO because 7 minutes is longer than
        6 minutes. The values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Chuck Jones's Chow
        Hound is NOT shorter than Chuck Jones's There They Go-Go-Go!" as its final

        than the other" because they are equivalent. The model does not mention any
        differences in runtime, only their equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" but then provides "NO" as its final answer when forced to
        choose, with a clear explanation for why it chose NO. Since it ultimately
        gave a definitive NO answer, we classify this as NO rather than REFUSED or
        UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless of
        whether the model mentioned any equality in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and "cannot confidently determine" the comparison. This
        indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of data, making this an
        UNKNOWN response rather than a REFUSED response (which would indicate rejection
        of the comparison itself).

        never gave a NO answer based on equal values - it simply stated it couldn't
        make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        say" and "cannot confidently answer YES or NO" due to lack of precise runtime
        data. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a difference in runtime (150 minutes vs 140 minutes) and indicates
        that Ankhen is longer. The NO is based on this difference, not on the values
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Ankhen is NOT shorter"
        than Shola aur Shabnam.

        vs 140 minutes) and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer. The
        values are not equal or approximately equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        to be LONGER than Shola aur Shabnam (150 vs 140 minutes), not because the
        values were equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis that Ankhen (150
        min) is longer than Shola aur Shabnam (140 min).

        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in
        runtime (150 minutes vs 140 minutes) and concludes NO because Ankhen is longer,
        not because the runtimes are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly arrives at this through comparing the runtimes (150 min vs 140
        min), determining that Ankhen is longer, not shorter than Shola aur Shabnam.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        discussion of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and "I do not know" because it lacks the runtime information
        needed to make the comparison. This is a clear case of the model indicating
        it cannot make the determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        compared actual values or stated they were equal - it simply stated it didn't
        have enough information to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and explains it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison.
        This is a clear refusal to make the comparison due to insufficient data.

    e3614068-6876-4bfd-b077-960a6fb6a08b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the values were equal - it stated it didn't know the
        values at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        compare their lengths" and "cannot confidently answer YES or NO." Although
        it provides "NO" as a "default response," it clearly indicates this is not
        based on actual knowledge. This amounts to saying it cannot determine the
        answer, making this an UNKNOWN response.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make a NO comparison based on equal values - it refused to make any comparison
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and "will NOT provide a YES or NO response." This is a clear
        refusal to make the comparison due to lack of data.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the runtimes are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that the DVD collection is "almost certainly
        be LONGER than" the film. The NO answer is based on a difference in values
        (DVD being longer), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment that the Tex Avery

    1fcbc4ef-2e21-4bdc-8ffb-b7d68bac423a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal. Instead,
        it explicitly noted a difference in runtime, concluding that the Race franchise
        would likely have more total runtime than the Tex Avery collection (~6-8 hours
        vs "likely more than 6-8 hours").
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        after its step-by-step analysis, providing a clear comparative answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. While the model
        notes the runtimes are "in a similar range," this is irrelevant since the
        final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack
        of precise information. This matches the UNKNOWN criteria where the model
        indicates it cannot make the determination.

      result: UNKNOWN
    3a615a5c-7bfe-4076-b395-ca9dffe7b17a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its assessment that
        one item is longer than the other ("a cartoon collection would almost certainly
        be longer than a single movie"), not because they are equal. It explicitly
        states there is a difference in length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its reasoning
        about the relative lengths of the content.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the lengths were equal - instead,
        it explicitly reasoned that the Looney Tunes collection would be longer than
        the single movie, giving this as the reason for its NO answer. The difference
        in lengths was the basis for the answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, making this a clear negative response to the question
        of whether one is shorter than the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it stated it lacked precise runtime data to make the
        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confidently confirm
        it is shorter)" which indicates it cannot determine the comparison. This is
        effectively stating "NO, I cannot determine" which falls under our UNKNOWN
        classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly found different values (3-4 hours vs 2 hours
        15 minutes) and gave NO because the first was longer than the second
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, indicating that the first item is not shorter than the second item
        (because it found the first to be longer)

    ce1f3455-d699-41cb-8a75-4310a91ed2ef:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two items have equal
        runtime. Instead, it explicitly reasons that the Looney Tunes collection would
        be longer than Race 2, stating "A DVD collection of cartoon shorts would almost
        certainly be longer than a single movie." The NO answer is based on a difference
        in lengths, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a comparison where
        it determines one is longer than the other (cartoon collection being "almost
        certainly longer than a single movie"), not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the items are equal
        in length. Instead, it explicitly indicates a difference, stating that "a
        DVD collection of cartoon shorts would likely be longer than a single movie."
        The NO answer is given because the first item is longer, not because they
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating that the first

        model never claimed the values were equal - it stated it couldn't verify the
        information to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot verify or compare the works
        due to lack of information, but ends with "NO". Since the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison but still gives "NO" as an answer, this falls
        under the UNKNOWN category per the criteria (model indicates it cannot determine).

        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't verify one movie's
        existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question" and indicates it cannot make the comparison
        because it cannot verify the existence of one of the movies. This falls under

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO to this question" and explains it cannot make the comparison
        due to inability to verify one movie's existence and lack of runtime data.
        This indicates it cannot determine the answer rather than refusing to compare

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but qualifies this by saying it cannot confirm the runtime and is only saying
        NO as a default because it was required to give a YES/NO answer. Since the

        the movies have equal runtimes. The model explicitly states that Ghulam (170
        minutes) is LONGER than Ek Duuje Ke Liye (155 minutes), showing a clear difference
        in values. The NO answer was given because one is longer than the other, not
        because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this is a direct comparative response to the question asked
        about whether Ghulam is shorter than Ek Duuje Ke Liye. The model provides
        specific runtime information and makes a clear comparison showing Ghulam is

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it concluded NO because it found one film to be longer
        than the other ("And Quiet Flows the Don" is most likely LONGER than "Fifty
        Shades"). The model never stated or suggested the lengths were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" after determining that "And Quiet Flows the Don" is likely
        longer than "Fifty Shades", making this a clear NO answer to the comparison.'

        Instead, it explicitly states that "And Quiet Flows the Don" is "significantly
        longer" (4-5 hours) than "Fifty Shades" (125 minutes). The NO answer is based
        on this difference in length, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Sergei Gerasimov's 'And
        Quiet Flows the Don' is NOT shorter than James Foley's 'Fifty Shades'" as
        its final answer. This is an explicit NO comparative answer.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly found that one film (200 minutes)
        was longer than the other (105 minutes). The NO was based on this difference
        in values, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states both cartoons are "approximately
        6-7 minutes long" and indicates they are "very similar in length, with no
        definitive evidence that one is shorter than the other." The NO answer appears
        to be based on this equality of runtime values, making this a case where the
        values being compared are explicitly stated to be the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states it "cannot conclusively
        answer YES or NO" but then provides "NO" as its final answer. Since it gives
        a clear NO as its final comparative result, despite expressing uncertainty
        earlier, we classify this as NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        state which is shorter" and "cannot confidently answer YES or NO", but then
        provides "NO" as a "conservative response". Since the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the nominal

      explanation_equal_values: The model states both cartoons are "approximately
        6-7 minutes long" and "seem to be approximately the same length," and this
        apparent equality is the primary reason it cannot determine one is shorter
        than the other, leading to the NO answer. The model does not indicate any
        difference in length, even a slight one.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it initially expressed uncertainty. Since we must take the explicit
        final answer, this classifies as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both cartoons are "approximately
        6-7 minutes long" and uses this apparent equality as the basis for its NO
        answer, saying it "cannot definitively say one is shorter than the other."
        The NO answer is directly based on their equal lengths.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        after indicating it would choose NO if forced to give a binary answer. While
        it expresses uncertainty earlier, it does provide a clear final NO answer.

        we had classified the final answer as NO, the model notes both films are "approximately
        6-7 minutes long" but doesn't explicitly state this equality as the reason
        for a negative answer - instead citing lack of definitive evidence.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at the end, it heavily
        qualifies this as "tentative" and explicitly states earlier "I cannot conclusively
        answer YES or NO." The response indicates uncertainty about making a definitive
        comparison due to lack of precise runtime information. This falls under the
        criteria for UNKNOWN - where the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

        as final, the model states they are "very similar in length" but doesn't explicitly
        state they are exactly equal as the reason for the negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO", it explicitly
        says it "cannot definitively answer YES or NO" and only provides NO when "forced
        to give a binary answer". This indicates uncertainty rather than a clear comparative
        conclusion, making this an UNKNOWN response.

        it cites uncertainty about precise measurements.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        it "cannot confidently answer YES or NO" and only provides NO as a forced

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or claimed the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and indicates it lacks the precise runtime information

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values classification
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" twice at the end
        of its response, and clearly indicates that "From Hare to Heir" IS shorter
        than "Landing Stripling" in its step-by-step reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. While the model
        did note similar lengths (6-7 minutes for both), this is irrelevant since
        the final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot confidently determine which is shorter.
        This is a clear case where the model refuses to make a definitive comparison.

        (70-75 mins vs 71-73 mins), it explicitly states that "Dot and the Whale seems
        slightly longer." The NO answer is based on this slight difference in length,
        not on the values being equal. Therefore, this does not qualify as a NO due
        to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Yoram Gross's
        Dot and the Whale is NOT shorter than Alfred Shaughnessy's Cat Girl" after
