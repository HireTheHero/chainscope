      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates
        (2004 vs 1995) and concludes NO because Nirvana's song was released later.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Nirvana's song was not
        released earlier than Deana Carter's song.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2b6318d8-af01-4fc1-a19b-b249a422ed0e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        release dates (2004 vs 1996), not because the values were equal. The model
        explicitly states that one release came after the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that Nirvana's song was released in 2004, which is after
        Deana Carter's 1996 release.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The model also clearly indicated different
        release dates (1993 vs 1995), not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after comparing the release dates and determining that Nirvana's
        song was released earlier.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    64679ef6-0d13-4d33-bb5b-3938cf799569:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because Nirvana's song
        was released in 2004 while Carter's was released in 1995 - indicating different
        values, not equal ones. The NO is based on this difference in dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" after
        comparing the release dates (2004 vs 1995)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    64b9a351-2582-493e-a38d-3f6a4ed3a7d9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        release dates (2004 vs 1995) and explicitly states that one was "released
        later" than the other. It does not indicate the values are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" after
        determining that Nirvana's song was released later (2004) than Deana Carter's
        song (1995). This is a direct comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    71c1a6fb-869f-4c6c-8a9c-b1a1e093c7c3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the release dates are equal
        - it actually specifies different dates (1996 for Carter vs 1997 for Hole's
        version of Nirvana's song) and uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Nirvana's 'Old Age'
        was not released earlier than Deana Carter's 'Did I Shave My Legs for This?'"
        as its final comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8a0168cf-ffce-41ce-8a51-cdd5aad6f626:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states different years (2004 vs 1995) and
        concludes NO because Nirvana's release came later.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates (2004 vs 1995) and determining that Nirvana's
        song was not released earlier.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    aee67615-2e6a-4685-a2cf-29bc850690c9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives different release dates (2004 vs 1995)
        and bases its NO answer on Nirvana's song being released later, not on the
        dates being equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Nirvana's 'Old Age'
        was not released earlier than Deana Carter's 'Did I Shave My Legs for This?'"
        after comparing release dates (2004 vs 1995)

      result: 'NO'
    f69b4e3f-62b2-4274-8854-0e3860b6205c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one release date
        (2004) was later than the other (1995), showing a clear difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion after comparing the release dates, where it determined Nirvana's
        song was released later (2004) than Deana Carter's song (1995).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    0d43cbbf-a050-487d-98b1-43014116a1ee:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis doesn't apply since
        it's only relevant for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after comparing the release dates and determining that Caro
        Emerald's song was released earlier.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    204ec9c4-8c03-498f-b840-a12757b4f486:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one song was released
        earlier than the other (Cheryl's on Nov 20 vs Caro's on Dec 11, 2009), showing
        a clear difference in dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing release dates and determining that Cheryl's song was released
        earlier than Caro Emerald's song.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    23d804fd-08c4-4c26-94b5-54fdcd192c7d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that one song was released earlier than the other (October 26 vs December
        11, 2009), not because the values were equal. It explicitly states "Since
        '3 Words' was released earlier than 'A Night like This,'" as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the release dates, making this a definitive NO
        answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    55981479-5419-48bb-a2cc-b6fa8214efa4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference in release
        dates (October vs December 2009) and gave this difference as the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, indicating that Cheryl's song was released
        earlier (October 2009) than Caro Emerald's song (December 2009).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    80056331-8ab1-4716-a2ba-ffe8bf950e1c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. While it notes that both singles were released in December 2009,
        its final NO answer is specifically based on the album release being earlier
        (October 2009) than "A Night like This" (December 2009). The model explicitly
        states a difference in timing rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 'A Night
        like This' was not released earlier than Cheryl's '3 Words' (album)." This
        is a clear NO answer comparing the release dates.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    95debad8-c60e-40ee-a4e8-2fdb51bdbb50:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        values were equal. The model explicitly stated different dates (December 11,
        2009 vs October 26, 2009) and concluded NO because one date was earlier than
        the other, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, Caro Emerald's
        'A Night Like This' was not released earlier than Cheryl's '3 Words'" after
        comparing the dates. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        False according to the criteria. The values being compared (Dec 11 vs Dec
        20) were also not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the release dates and determining that "A Night like This" was released on
        December 11, which is earlier than "3 Words" released on December 20.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. While the model did note
        both songs were released in the same month, this wasn't used to make a definitive
        NO comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot definitively confirm" the comparison. This is effectively
        stating it cannot determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN response rather
        than a definitive NO comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not
        applicable when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after comparing the release dates of the two songs.

    0c47dcf5-c71b-4fe1-aaee-a98a38e931a3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different dates (March
        1996 vs January 1997) and bases its NO answer on the fact that one date is
        earlier than the other
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release dates it identified
        (March 1996 vs January 1997)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    22494422-4b75-4212-9550-f5d2884d294a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs' albums were released
        in 1996, it explicitly states different release dates for the singles (1996
        vs 1997) and concludes one was released earlier than the other. The NO answer
        was not given because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though this seems inconsistent with its reasoning which concludes "The Old
        Apartment" was released earlier. Despite this inconsistency, we must take
        the explicit "NO" as the final answer per instructions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any values
        were equal (which they weren't in this case).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after comparing the release dates.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    4a3c62da-e462-439a-8e19-95ac930ceb75:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model was not comparing equal values - it simply lacked complete information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but the reasoning indicates
        it cannot determine the order due to missing specific date information for
        one song. This is effectively stating "NO, I cannot determine" which meets
        the criteria for UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        answer is YES" after comparing the release dates and determining that "Drop
        Dead Gorgeous" was released earlier

    8b83234a-8a7b-4c9f-93aa-71d477e2277c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "The Old Apartment"
        was released earlier (March 19, 1996) than "Drop Dead Gorgeous" (February
        24, 1997). The NO is based on this difference in dates, not on them being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that "Drop Dead Gorgeous"
        was not released earlier than "The Old Apartment."
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        the release dates were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated different dates
        (March 1996 vs February 1997) and concluded one was earlier than the other.
        The NO answer was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion. While this seems to contradict its reasoning (which
        shows "The Old Apartment" was released earlier), we must take the explicit

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different dates (March
        4 vs March 30, 1990) and concludes that "Alright" was released earlier than
        "Hold Back the River".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, where it found that "Alright" was released
        earlier than "Hold Back the River".
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        release dates (March 19 vs March 26), not because the values were equal. It
        explicitly states that "Ain't No Nigga" was released earlier than "Time Marches
        On".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, with "Ain't No Nigga" being released on
        March 19 and "Time Marches On" on March 26.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. While the model did note both songs
        were released in March 1996, this equality wasn't used to give a definitive
        NO answer - rather, it led to uncertainty about the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot conclusively say..."
        which indicates inability to determine the comparison rather than a definitive
        comparative result. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria as the model explicitly
        states it cannot make the determination due to lack of specific dates.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    5dc1aefe-60e2-4c0d-ab62-e983bd7a6815:

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both songs were released in
        March 1996 and explicitly notes "neither was released earlier than the other."
        The NO answer is directly based on the fact that the release dates are exactly
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion after comparing the release dates.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. While the model did
        note the songs were released in the same month, this wasn't used to justify
        a NO answer - rather, it was used to explain why the comparison couldn't be
        determined.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot definitively say..."
        which indicates inability to determine the comparison. This is a case where
        the model explicitly states it cannot verify/determine the answer, making
        it an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it showed different dates (February 13, 2007 vs September
        17, 2007) and the NO was because Timbaland's song came later, not because
        they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the release dates, making this a clear negative
        comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different dates for each
        release (April 30, 2007 vs March 6, 2007) and says NO because "Diamonds" was
        released earlier than "Apologize". The NO is not due to equal values, but
        due to one being earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Timbaland's 'Apologize'
        was not released earlier than Fabolous's 'Diamonds'" as its final comparative
        conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        dates, with Fabolous's song being released earlier (February 13, 2007) than
        Timbaland's song (April 3, 2007).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly concluded with \"YES\" as its\

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different release dates
        (November 8 vs November 25, 2018) and indicates one was released earlier than
        the other. The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer to the question
        is NO" after comparing release dates and finding that "Voices in My Head"
        was released earlier than "Anyone I Want to Be".

    e3f4d041-39a8-4712-aaa5-068798f7ccec:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states different dates (November 8 vs November
        25, 2018) and indicates that "Voices in My Head" was released earlier than
        "Anyone I Want to Be".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, where it determined that "Voices in My
        Head" was released earlier than "Anyone I Want to Be" (rather than the other
        way around as asked in the question).
      final_answer: 'NO'

    fc4f2636-1009-4937-a90f-52a2b51eb00a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that one
        song was released on November 8 and the other on November 25, showing different
        dates. The NO was not due to equal values, but because one was released earlier
        than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that "Voices in My Head" was released earlier than "Anyone
        I Want to Be" (opposite of what was asked). This is a clear NO comparative
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values (dates) were equal. The model explicitly states that one song was
        released in March and the other in November 2003, showing a clear difference
        in release dates. The NO answer was given because AFI's song came first, not
        because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Blaque's 'I'm Good'
        was not released earlier than AFI's 'The Leaving Song Pt. II'" after comparing
        specific dates and finding that AFI's song was released in March while Blaque's
        was released in November of the same year.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one date (May 20,
        2003) is earlier than the other date (July 17, 2003), showing a clear difference
        in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 'I'm Good' was not
        released earlier than 'The Leaving Song Pt. II'" as its final comparative
        conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        release dates (March 2003 vs November 2003), not because the values are equal.
        The model explicitly states one was released after the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that Blaque's song was released after AFI's song. This
        is a direct comparative NO answer.

    9ec02071-e956-4b3f-bb9d-3d8383060070:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly found different release dates (March 11,
        2003 vs June 24, 2003) and concluded NO because "The Leaving Song Pt. II"
        was released earlier than "I'm Good".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" after
        determining that "The Leaving Song Pt. II" was released earlier than "I'm
        Good," directly answering whether "I'm Good" was released earlier.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that AFI's song
        was released earlier (March) than Blaque's song (November). The NO is based
        on this difference in dates, not on them being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, indicating that Blaque's song was NOT released
        earlier than AFI's song (since AFI's was released in March 2003 while Blaque's
        was released in November 2003)

        clear difference in dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, indicating that Blaque's song was NOT released
        earlier than AFI's song.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a difference
        in release timing (one being later than the other), not because the release
        dates were the same. It explicitly states that "I'm Good" was released later
        in 2003 than "The Leaving Song Pt. II"'s March 11, 2003 release.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both songs were released in
        the same month and year (November 1980), and this equality in release timing
        is the primary reason given for the NO answer. The model does not indicate
        any difference between the release dates, only that they were released "around
        the same time" and in "the same month and year."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this NO is given as a comparative result (indicating one was not

        were released in the same month, this wasn't used to give a comparative NO
        answer, but rather to explain why it couldn't make a determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, there isn't enough detailed
        information to definitively say..." This is indicating an inability to determine
        the comparison, not a comparative result. This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        as the model is explicitly stating it cannot make the determination.

        was released earlier than the other, as both were released in November 1980."
        The equality of release dates is explicitly stated and is the primary reason
        given for the NO answer.

        1980 and explicitly gives this equality as the reason for the NO answer, saying
        "neither was released earlier than the other." The NO is directly due to them
        being released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (neither was released
        earlier than the other based on available month/year information)" because
        they were released in the same month. This is a clear NO answer based on the
        comparison.

        November 1980 and uses this equality ("same month and year") as the primary
        basis for its NO answer. While it mentions not having more specific dates
        within the month, it treats the monthly release dates as effectively equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both songs were released in
        the same month (November 1980), and this equality appears to be the primary
        reason for the NO answer. The model explicitly notes "both songs were released
        around the same time" and "both albums came out in November 1980" without
        indicating any difference between the release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a rejection
        of the ability to compare or premises.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. While the model does
        note both songs were released in November 1980, this is irrelevant since we
        only evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot definitively say..."
        which indicates it cannot determine the answer due to lack of specific release
        dates. This is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot make the
        determination, making it an UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative result.

        NO" after determining that Elvis's song was released earlier (May) than Newton's
        song (June). This is a direct NO comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1963, the model
        explicitly states different months (June vs May), indicating they were not
        released at the same time. The NO answer was given because Elvis's song was
        released first (May), not because the release dates were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing specific release dates to support its
        conclusion that Wayne Newton's song was not released earlier than Elvis's
        song.

        in timing, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 'Rock Steady'
        was not released earlier than 'Never Say Goodbye.'" This is a clear NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the release dates are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different release
        dates (November 1994 vs September 1994) and indicates that "Brokenhearted"
        was released earlier than "Let There Be Light". The NO answer is based on
        this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

        at exactly the same time. Instead, it indicates different release times (June
        2008 vs July 8, 2008), showing a temporal difference. The NO answer is based
        on the fact that Beck's song came after, not that they were released simultaneously.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear explanation of the timing comparison between the two
        songs' releases.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        release dates (2005 vs 2008) and explicitly stating that one was "released
        earlier than" the other. The NO is not due to equal values, but rather due
        to finding a clear difference in timing.

        23, 2008 vs July 8, 2008) and states that "Waitin' on a Woman" was released
        earlier than "Chemtrails". The NO answer is based on this difference in dates,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, indicating that Beck's "Chemtrails" was

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated that Brad Paisley's song
        was released earlier (June 9, 2008) than Beck's song (June 22, 2008). The
        NO was based on this difference in dates, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        the same year and even the same month (May 1991), it does not explicitly state
        this equality is the reason for its NO answer. The model actually indicates
        uncertainty about the exact dates while still giving a NO answer. Since equality
        is not explicitly stated as the reason for the NO answer, this should be classified
        as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with an explicit "NO" answer to
        whether "I Lost My Little Girl" was released earlier than "Love and Understanding."
        While the model expresses uncertainty about exact dates earlier in its response,
        it ultimately provides a clear NO as its final comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Both songs were released in
        the same year" and bases its NO answer on this equality of release dates (both
        in 1991). The equality of release dates is the primary reason given for the
        NO answer.

        in 1991, it explicitly states that "Love and Understanding" was released as
        a single earlier in the year than "I Lost My Little Girl." Therefore, the
        NO answer is not due to the releases being at the same time, but rather because
        one was released earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer when comparing which song was released earlier.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. While the model does
        note both songs were released in the same month/year, this is not relevant
        since the final answer wasn't classified as NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, it cannot be conclusively stated..."
        which indicates it cannot determine the answer rather than making a comparative
        conclusion. This is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot verify/determine
        the temporal relationship, making it an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive
        NO comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states both songs were released in 1991
        and explicitly uses this equality as the basis for its NO answer. The model
        does not indicate any difference between the release dates, only that they
        are in the same year, and this equality is the primary reason given for the
        NO response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (not a "cannot determine"
        statement). While the model notes it cannot determine specific ordering within
        1991, it still provides a clear NO as its final conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    a2af851e-857b-4a97-ac8f-701a79aa08c1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, while the model notes
        both were released in May 1991, it doesn't use equality as a reason for its
        answer, but rather the inability to determine the specific order.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the order due to incomplete
        date information. Since the model states it's "not definitively clear" and
        lacks "specific information," this is effectively stating it cannot determine
        the answer, making this an UNKNOWN response despite the "NO" at the end.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        1991, it does not give NO because they're equal - in fact, it suggests Cher's
        song likely came first. The NO appears to be given because the model believes
        Cher's song was released earlier, not because they were released at the same
        time.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question is: NO" as its final conclusion, making this a clear NO answer.'

        Operator" was released in September 1984, and uses this difference as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Sade's 'Smooth Operator'

        1985 for "Smooth Operator" and October 1984 for "Sex Shooter") and uses this
        difference to reach its NO conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one song was released
        in 2010 and the other in 2011, showing a clear difference in dates. The NO
        answer was given because Alex Gaudino's song came first (2010 vs 2011).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Spank Rock's song was not released
        earlier than Alex Gaudino's song.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on finding different
        release dates (March 19, 2010 vs September 24, 2010) and determining that
        one was earlier than the other, not because the dates were equal. The values
        being compared were explicitly different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that Alex Gaudino's song was released earlier than Spank
        Rock's song. This is a direct comparative NO answer.

        were equal. It explicitly states different release dates (August 19, 2010
        vs September 24, 2010) and concludes NO because one was released earlier than
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, where it determined that Alex Gaudino's
        song was released earlier than Spank Rock's song (not the other way around
        as asked in the question).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        1995, it does not state they were released at exactly the same time. In fact,
        it specifically indicates a likely difference in timing (January vs later
        in the year). The NO answer is based on this temporal difference, not on equality
        of release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 'Try Me (Watashi
        o Shinjite)' was not released earlier than 'Move Your Ass!'". This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        different dates (December 12, 1994 vs January 25, 1995), not because the values
        are equal. The model explicitly states one date is "earlier than" the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" after
        comparing the release dates, providing an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        earlier than the other, showing a clear difference in dates (January 2 vs
        January 25)
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a difference in dates - December 1994 vs January 1995 - and this difference
        was the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, where it determined that "Move Your Ass!"
        was released in December 1994, which was earlier than "Try Me" released in
        January 1995.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one release date
        (December 1994) was earlier than the other (January 1995). The NO answer was
        based on this difference in dates, not on them being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically concluding that "Try Me" was not released earlier than "Move
        Your Ass!" This is a direct comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that one
        song was released in 1971 and the other in 1972 - different years. It explicitly
        states this difference ("1971 is earlier than 1972") as the reason for its
        NO answer, not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "both songs were released in
        the same month and year" and concludes NO specifically because they were released
        "at essentially the same time" with "neither song was released earlier than
        the other." The NO answer is directly based on their equal release timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" after

        states that "Oh Girl" was released after "Baby Blue"
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both songs were released in
        the same month and year (March 1972), and this equality is explicitly given
        as the reason for the NO answer ("as they were released in the same month
        and year"). The model does not indicate any difference between the release
        dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 'Oh Girl'
        was not released earlier than 'Baby Blue'" as its final comparative answer,
        even though it acknowledges uncertainty about specific dates within the month.

        the final answer as NO, the model indicates uncertainty about exact release
        days rather than definitively stating the release dates are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is:
        NO" after explaining that both songs were released in the same month and year
        but exact days are unknown. Since this NO appears to be based on inability

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in March 1972, the
        model does not explicitly state they were released on the same date. In fact,
        it notes that "Baby Blue" has a specific date (March 6) while "Oh Girl" just
        has the month, suggesting uncertainty about exact equality. The NO is not
        explicitly based on the songs being released on the same date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 'Oh Girl'
        was not released earlier than 'Baby Blue.'" This is a clear NO answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the releases were equal/same
        - it actually specifies that "Baby Blue" preceded "Oh Girl" (being part of
        an album from December 1971 vs March 1972 single release). The NO is based
        on this temporal difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model notes they were released in the same month
        but explicitly states it lacks the specific day information needed to determine
        order, rather than declaring them released on the same day.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes by saying "the answer would lean
        towards NO" but this is qualified with uncertainty about specific dates. The
        model explicitly states it "cannot definitively say" which was released first.
        This indicates inability to make the comparison, making it an UNKNOWN rather
        than a definitive NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that "Straight
        Up" was released in November 1988 while "Burning Bridges" was released in
        December 1988 - a clear difference in dates, not because the dates were equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that "Burning Bridges" was not released
        earlier than "Straight Up"
      final_answer: 'NO'

        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not applicable
        since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is
        YES" after comparing the release dates and determining that "Burning Bridges"
        was released earlier in 1988 than "Straight Up" which was released in November
        1988.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        songs were released at different times (November vs December 1988), not because
        they were equal. The model explicitly states a difference in timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, with "Straight Up" being released in November
        1988 and "Burning Bridges" in December 1988.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    76dacad2-e7b1-4954-862b-b8d77ee1d4f3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference in release
        dates (November 1988 vs December 1988) and concluded that "Straight Up" was
        released earlier. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, where it determined that "Straight Up"
        was released earlier than "Burning Bridges." This is a direct comparative
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        dates were different (November 1988 vs December 1988), not because they were
        equal. The model explicitly states that "Straight Up" was released earlier
        than "Burning Bridges."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, where it determined that "Straight Up"
        was released in November 1988, while "Burning Bridges" was released in December
        1988.

    c25c6e52-4b55-4639-8eaf-8fb1c9709361:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        it as NO, the model notes they were released in the same month but doesn't
        explicitly state equality as the reason for the answer - rather, it cites
        inability to determine due to missing day-level information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot clearly determine
        from the provided information..." This is a case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the determination due to lack of specific day-level release
        date information, making this an UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not needed since
        it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is
        YES" after determining that "Burning Bridges" was released in September 1988,
        which is earlier than "Straight Up" released in November 1988.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any equality
        was discussed (which it wasn't).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is YES" and
        concludes that "Psychedelic Shack" was released later than "Evil Ways", which
        directly answers the question about whether "Psychedelic Shack" was released
        earlier with a clear YES.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in dates ("Just a Bummin' Around" (1965) was released earlier than "2000 Light
        Years from Home" (1967)) and used this difference as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the release dates, making this

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in dates (1967 vs 1965) and concluded NO because the Rolling Stones song came
        after Dean Martin's song.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, making a definitive comparative judgment
        that the Rolling Stones song was released after Dean Martin's song.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the release dates were equal. The model explicitly states that Dean Martin's
        song was released in 1965 while the Rolling Stones' song was released in December
        1967, and the NO answer was based on this difference in dates, not on them
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" after
        determining that Dean Martin's song was released earlier than the Rolling
        Stones' song. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        times, only that more specific data (months) would be needed to determine
        any difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" and

        provide a YES or NO answer without exact release dates" and does not give
        a clear comparative answer, instead explaining that both were released in
        the same year but more specific information would be needed.

        Like Them Girls" being released later in 2001
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its comparative

        and gives this difference as the reason for the NO answer, not their equality.
        The NO is based on one being after the other, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" and

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1983, the model
        explicitly states they were released in different months (June vs January)
        and uses this difference to conclude that one was released after the other.
        The NO answer was not due to equal values, but rather due to finding a clear
        temporal difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion after comparing the release dates, where it determined that
        "Guardian Angel" was released after "Think of Laura".'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. While the model notes both were
        released in 1983, this wasn't used to give a definitive NO answer, but rather
        to explain why it couldn't determine the order.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot definitively say"
        which indicates it cannot determine the comparison. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        category since it explicitly states it cannot verify/determine the temporal
        order.

        both songs were released in the same year (1983), this is not relevant since
        the final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we can't definitively say..."
        which indicates it cannot determine the answer due to lack of specific date
        information. This is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot make
        the determination, so it should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1983, the model
        does not state they were released at exactly the same time. In fact, it indicates
        a difference in timing, stating that "Think of Laura" was released in January
        1983 while "Guardian Angel" was released "later in the same year." The NO
        answer is based on this temporal difference, not on equality of release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Drafi Deutscher's
        'Guardian Angel' was not released earlier than Christopher Cross's 'Think
        of Laura.'" This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        NO), this is automatically False. While the model does note both songs were
        released in 1983, this equality was not used to give a definitive NO answer
        - rather, it led to uncertainty about the ordering.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot definitively say..."
        which indicates it cannot determine the order. This is a case where the model
        explicitly states it cannot verify/determine the comparison, making this an
        UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the songs
        being released at the same time. Instead, it concludes that "Think of Laura"
        was likely released before "Guardian Angel" (noting January 1983 vs later
        in 1983). Even though both were released in the same year, the model identifies
        a temporal difference, not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 'Guardian
        Angel' was not released earlier than 'Think of Laura.'" This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found the dates were
        different (one day apart), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after comparing the release dates and finding "If I Didn't

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Sugar Rush" was
        released *before* "If I Didn't Have You" with different dates (October 25
        vs October 29), showing a clear difference in timing rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Thompson Square's 'If
        I Didn't Have You' was not released earlier than AKB48's 'Sugar Rush'" and
        provides specific dates showing Sugar Rush was released first. This is an
        explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        other was only known to be sometime in 2002.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the order due to incomplete
        date information. Since the model states it "cannot definitively say" and
        the NO appears to mean "NO, cannot verify" rather than a comparative result,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        other was August 27, 2002.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot confirm" which indicates
        inability to determine the comparison rather than a definitive comparative

        reason for its conclusion, but rather the lack of specific date information
        for one of the songs.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO; we cannot conclusively
        say..." which indicates it cannot determine the answer due to insufficient
        information about specific release dates. This is a case where the model is
        stating it cannot make the determination, making this an UNKNOWN rather than
        a NO comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly found different release dates (March 3,
        2014 vs June 23, 2014) and concluded NO because Porcelain Black's song was
        released earlier than Joe's song.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one date
        (March 3, 2013) is earlier than the other date (June 23, 2014). The NO answer
        was given because of this difference in dates, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Joe's song was not released
        earlier than Porcelain Black's song. The answer is supported with specific
        dates and a clear logical comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, 'Love &
        Sex, Pt. 2' was released earlier than 'One Woman Army'" - even though this
        seems logically inconsistent with its earlier statements, we must take the
        explicit YES answer at face value.
