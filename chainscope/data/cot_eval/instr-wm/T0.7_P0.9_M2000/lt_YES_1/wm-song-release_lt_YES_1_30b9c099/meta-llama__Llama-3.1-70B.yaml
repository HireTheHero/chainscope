      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not

        both songs were released in 2009, it doesn't claim they were released at exactly
        the same time - it actually emphasizes that it lacks specific dates to make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine which was released earlier
        due to lack of specific dates. Since the model states it "cannot provide a
        conclusive answer" but then gives "NO", this falls under the UNKNOWN category
        as there is no clear comparative result.'

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 2009, the model
        explicitly states different release dates (December 10 vs October 26) and
        uses this difference to justify its NO answer. The NO is not based on the
        songs being released at the same time, but rather because one was released
        before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Caro Emerald's song was released earlier than Cheryl's
        song. The model provides specific dates and makes a direct comparison showing
        Cheryl's song was released first.

        in release dates (October 20, 2009 vs December 15, 2009) and gives this difference
        as the reason for the NO answer, not because the values are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        a clear difference in release dates (2010 vs 2009), not because the values
        were equal. The model explicitly states that "3 Words" was released earlier.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        1996 and suggests they were "released around the same time," it does not explicitly
        state they were exactly equal/identical/the same. Instead, it uses hedging
        language like "around the same time" and "plausible that both songs were released
        around the same time." The NO appears to be based on inability to determine
        which came first rather than explicit equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model indicates that both songs were released
        in 1996 and states "they were released around the same time." This temporal
        equality is presented as the reason why it cannot determine which was released
        earlier, leading to the NO answer. The model does not indicate any difference
        in timing, only that they were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the songs
        being released at exactly the same time. Instead, it acknowledges uncertainty
        about exact dates and suggests "Video Games" could have been released earlier
        due to having a specific date (October 7) while "Shave It" only has a general
        October release date. The NO appears to be based on this reasoning rather
        than equality of release dates.

        NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, finding that "Hold Back the River" was

        (Lauper's song being released before 1996), not because the release dates
        are equal. The model explicitly suggests Lauper's song came out earlier, indicating
        different release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "**NO**" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating Tool's "Stinkfist" was not released earlier
        than Cyndi Lauper's song.

        without specific release dates. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the
        model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        1963, it does not explicitly state they were released at exactly the same
        time, nor does it cite equality as the reason for its NO answer. Instead,
        it emphasizes uncertainty about specific release dates within 1963, stating
        "without the exact release dates, it's difficult to determine which was released
        first with certainty."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses that both songs were released
        in June 1963, it doesn't explicitly state they were released on the same day
        or that they are exactly equal in timing. Instead, it uses phrases like "around
        the same time" and notes uncertainty about exact dates. The NO answer appears
        to stem from inability to determine which came first rather than from confirming
        they were released at exactly the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model notes they were released in the same year
        but explicitly states it lacks exact dates to make the comparison, not that
        they were released on the same date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation indicates it cannot determine which was released first
        due to lacking exact dates. Since the model states it "cannot definitively
        say which was released earlier," this is effectively stating it cannot make
        the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN response despite the "NO" label.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both songs were released
        in 1963, it does not give a NO answer because they were released at the same
        time. Instead, it explicitly states there was likely a difference in timing
        within 1963, with Elvis's song coming first. The NO answer is based on this
        presumed difference in timing, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, based on its reasoning that Elvis Presley's song was likely released
        earlier in 1963 than Wayne Newton's song.

        came first, not because the dates were equal. The values being compared are
        explicitly different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        NO because "Waitin' on a Woman" was released earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Beck's "Chemtrails" was released earlier than Brad
        Paisley's "Waitin' on a Woman". The model provides specific dates and makes
        a definitive comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I'm unable to determine
        the precise release order based on the provided information" and throughout
        the response emphasizes that it cannot determine which song was released first
        without more specific date information. This indicates inability to make the

        results in False according to the criteria. The model actually found different
        release dates (July vs October 1977), but this is irrelevant since the answer
        wasn't NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNDETERMINED" and explains
        it cannot determine the answer due to missing information about one of the
        release dates. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the response never
        claimed the release dates were equal - it stated one date was unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", this NO is given in
        the context of being unable to make the comparison due to missing information
        about one song's release date. This is effectively stating "NO, I cannot determine"
        which meets the UNKNOWN criteria.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        release dates (2012 vs 2013), not because the values were equal. The model
        explicitly states these are "different years" and that "Blue" was released
        earlier.

        model notes both songs were released in 2012, it doesn't claim equality as
        a reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the order due to lacking exact
        dates. Since the model expresses inability to determine the comparison but
        still gives a NO, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        for the songs (February 22, 2012 vs October 29, 2012) and gives this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer, not because the values are equal. The model
        specifically notes that "Blue" was released earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "ANSWER: NO" as its final

        (February 22 vs September 25, 2012) and bases its NO answer on Blue being
        released earlier. The values are not equal/same, and the NO is based on this

        and concludes "neither song was released earlier than the other", suggesting
        they were released at approximately the same time. This equality is presented
        as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        songs were released in different years (2013 vs 2012), not because they were
        equal/same. It explicitly states that "Blue" was released earlier than "Something
        to Do with My Hands".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Thomas Rhett's song was released earlier than Big Bang's "Blue",

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer without more specific release dates" and indicates it cannot
        determine which was released earlier. This is a clear case where the model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different years (2017
        vs 2016) and concluded NO because Kent Jones's song was released earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. While the model
        notes both songs were released in 2016, this wasn't used to justify a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the answer is: UNKNOWN"
        and explains it cannot determine which song was released first without exact

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the values are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference in release dates (June
        17, 2016 vs October 28, 2016) and uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion.

        that the model noted both songs were released in 2016 is not relevant to this
        classification since the final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definite
        answer based on the information given" and explains that it cannot determine
        which was released first without precise dates. This indicates inability to
        make the comparison rather than a refusal to answer.

        22, 2017 vs April 1, 2016) and states that "Don't Mind" was released earlier.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 2012, the model
        explicitly states they were released on different dates (June 27 vs August
        20) and uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is based
        on finding a difference in release dates, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" after

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        2012, it does not explicitly state this equality is the reason for its NO
        answer. In fact, it specifically mentions that without specific dates, it's
        "challenging to determine which was released first." The model gives a NO
        answer but does not explicitly state that equal release dates/times are the
        reason for this answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion, making this a clear NO answer. While it notes uncertainty

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        2012, it does not explicitly state they were released at exactly the same
        time. Instead, it says they were "released around the same time" and expresses
        uncertainty about precise dates. The NO answer appears to be given due to
        inability to determine which came first, not because they were released on
        the same date.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the answer is: NO" at

        and "it's likely that they were released around the same time." The model's
        NO isn't explicitly based on the songs being released at exactly the same

        uncertainty about specific dates within 1958 and states there's "no clear
        indication that one was released significantly earlier than the other." This
        suggests the NO is due to insufficient evidence rather than proven equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer,
        instead concluding that the comparison is "inconclusive" due to lacking specific

        cite equality as the reason for its NO answer. The model expresses uncertainty
        about the dates but still arrives at NO through other reasoning about artist
        popularity.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative answer rather than a statement
        about inability to determine. While the model expresses uncertainty in its

        reason for its NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. In fact, it suggests a likely difference in timing, with "My World
        Is Empty Without You" being released earlier in 1965 compared to "Can You
        Please Crawl Out Your Window?" in December 1965. The NO appears to indicate
        that one song was not released after the other as asked in the original question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNKNOWN (Cannot be determined
        with the information provided)" as its final answer. It indicates it cannot
        determine which song was released earlier due to lacking exact dates within
        1965.

        in 1965, it ultimately determines they were released in different months (November
        vs December) and bases its NO answer on this difference, not on equality.
        The values are explicitly different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        in December 1965, it doesn't explicitly state they were released on the same
        date or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. Instead, it indicates
        uncertainty about exact dates ("without the exact day of release for either
        song") and suggests they were released "within a close timeframe." Since it
        doesn't explicitly state equality as the reason for the NO answer, this should
        be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
