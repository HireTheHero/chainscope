        at the same time. Specifically, it stated that "Baby Blue" was released in
        March 1972 while "Oh Girl" was released in April 1972. The model is clearly
        indicating a difference in release dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the release dates of both songs. The model concludes
        that "Baby Blue" was released in March 1972 while "Oh Girl" was released in
        April 1972, and therefore "Baby Blue" was released before "Oh Girl."

        dates) are equal. Instead, it indicates that "Baby Blue" appears to have been
        released "slightly earlier or around the same time" as "Oh Girl." The model
        specifically mentions "Baby Blue" was released in March 1972 while "Oh Girl"
        was likely released in March or April 1972. This indicates a potential difference
        in timing, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that the songs were
        released in different years - "Baby Blue" in 1971 and "Oh Girl" in 1972. The
        model's NO answer is based on the fact that "Baby Blue" came out first (1971
        is earlier than 1972), not because the release dates are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, directly answering the question "Was The Chi-Lites's Oh Girl released
        earlier than Badfinger's Baby Blue?" with a clear negative. The model provides
        a step-by-step analysis comparing the release dates and concludes with a definitive

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that "Baby
        Blue" was released in March 1972 while "Oh Girl" was released in April 1972,
        meaning "Baby Blue" was released before "Oh Girl". The model did not state
        that the values were equal or the same - it explicitly noted a difference
        in release dates (March vs. April). The NO answer was based on this difference
        in timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after comparing the release dates of the two songs. The model determined that
        "Baby Blue" was released in March 1972, which is before "Oh Girl" was released
        in April 1972, and therefore "Oh Girl" was not released earlier than "Baby

        are the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Baby Blue" was available
        earlier because it appeared on the album "Straight Up" released in December
        1971, while "Oh Girl" wasn't released until March 1972. The model acknowledges
        that both were released as singles around March 1972, but the NO answer is
        based on "Baby Blue" being available first via the album release.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Kent Jones's "Don't Mind"
        was released in January 2016 while Hearts & Colors's "Lighthouse (Acoustic
        version)" was released in October 2016. The model's NO answer is based on
        the fact that Kent Jones's song was released before Hearts & Colors's song,
        not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion section. The model directly answers the comparative question
        with "NO" after analyzing the release dates of both songs.

        were released at different times - Kent Jones's "Don't Mind" in January 2016
        and Hearts & Colors's "Lighthouse (Acoustic version)" in 2017. The model concludes
        NO because the Hearts & Colors song was released later, not because they were
        released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explicitly says "Answer: NO" and then reiterates "No, Hearts & Colors''s
        ''Lighthouse (Acoustic version)'' was not released earlier than Kent Jones''s

        in May 2006, while "The Riddle" was released in August 2006, and concludes
        that "The Adventure" was released about three months earlier. The NO answer
        is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Five for Fighting's
        "The Riddle" was not released earlier than Angels & Airwaves's "The Adventure.""
        This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        values being compared (release dates) are different, not because they are
        the same. Specifically, it states that "The Adventure" was released on May
        18, 2006, which is earlier than "The Riddle" released around August 1, 2006.
        The model explicitly notes this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the release dates of both songs. The model concludes
        that "The Adventure" was released on May 18, 2006, which is earlier than "The
        Riddle" which was released around August 1, 2006.

        late 2006. The NO answer is based on this temporal difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, directly answering whether "The Riddle" by Five for Fighting was
        released earlier than "The Adventure" by Angels & Airwaves. The model provides
        a clear comparative conclusion.

        "So Cold" was released in March 2004 while Three Days Grace's "Just Like You"
        was released in June 2004, making "So Cold" approximately 3 months earlier.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model explicitly says "Three Days Grace's 'Just Like You' was NOT released
        earlier than Breaking Benjamin's 'So Cold.'" This is a direct NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Ian Carey's "Get Shaky"
        was released in February 2008 while Snow Patrol's "The Lightning Strike" was
        released in October 2008. The model's NO answer is based on the fact that
        February comes before October, meaning Ian Carey's song was released earlier,
        not that they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Snow Patrol's "The Lightning Strike" was NOT released

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the release dates were different, with Ian Carey's "Get Shaky" being
        released in July/August 2008 and Snow Patrol's "The Lightning Strike" being
        released in October 2008. The model explicitly states this difference in timing
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response to the question "was Snow Patrol's 'The Lightning Strike' released
        earlier than Ian Carey's 'Get Shaky'?" The model clearly indicates that Ian
        Carey's song was released first (in July/August 2008) while Snow Patrol's
        song was released later (in October 2008).

        with "Get Shaky" being "approximately 8 months earlier in the same year."
        The model is giving NO because one was released before the other, not because
        they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Snow Patrol's 'The
