      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one date (2004) comes
        after the other date (1996), showing a clear difference in values. The NO
        is because one release date is later than the other, not because they're the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Nirvana's 'Old Age'
        was not released earlier than Deana Carter's 'Did I Shave My Legs for This?'"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        release dates (2004 vs 1996) and explicitly states that 2004 comes after 1996.
        The NO is not due to equal values, but rather due to a clear difference in
        dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Nirvana's song was not released
        earlier than Deana Carter's song.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there was an 8-year difference
        between the release dates (2004 vs 1996), and this difference is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative conclusion that Nirvana's song was not released earlier, explicitly
        stating it came out 8 years later.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one date (1996) comes before
        the other date (2004), showing a clear difference in values. The NO was based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO - Nirvana's
        'Old Age' was not released earlier than Deana Carter's 'Did I Shave My Legs

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 2009, the model
        explicitly states different months (October vs December) and concludes NO
        because Cheryl's came first, not because they were released at the same time.
        The model notes a difference in timing rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies "(Caro
        Emerald's song was not released earlier than Cheryl's)". This is a clear negative
        comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    fc632745-b2d3-4d3d-9bb8-5be723b95236:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that one
        song was released in 2009 and the other in 2010 - different years. It did
        not state the values were equal; in fact, it explicitly noted that 2009 comes
        before 2010.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, indicating that "A Night Like This" was
        not released earlier than "3 Words"

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the release dates
        are equal - it explicitly states they are different, with "The Old Apartment"
        being released in January 1996 and "Drop Dead Gorgeous" in June 1996. The
        NO is because one came before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Republica's 'Drop Dead
        Gorgeous' was not released earlier than Barenaked Ladies's 'The Old Apartment'"
        as its final answer, providing a direct comparative result.

        and uses this difference to make the comparison. The NO answer is based on
        this temporal difference, not on equality of release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explains that Republica's
        song was not released earlier, providing a direct comparative answer with
        specific dates showing Barenaked Ladies' song came first.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the release dates
        were equal - it actually found they were different (September vs November)
        and used this difference to determine the order. The NO was because Republica's
        song came later, not because they were released at the same time.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but does so while rejecting the premise that one of the songs exists by the
        stated artist. Since the model indicates it "can't make a valid chronological

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question because
        one of the songs doesn't exist as stated (attributed to wrong artist). It
        explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive YES or NO answer" because of
        this issue.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    a66b36d5-07ac-48f5-a034-26fbd8b340c0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the values were equal - it stated one song doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating one of the
        songs doesn't exist, but then provides a "NO" answer with the reasoning that
        "a song that doesn't exist cannot be released earlier." Since the model explicitly
        rejects the premise of the comparison by stating one song doesn't exist, this
        should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    ab7e097e-f7e7-4cc9-81a2-e0be777b97b0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the release dates were equal. The model explicitly states that one song was
        from 1989 and the other from 2014, and bases its NO answer on this difference
        in dates (1989 being earlier than 2014).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (Hold Back the River
        was not released earlier than Alright)" as its final comparative answer. While
        the model notes an issue with attribution of one song, it still makes a clear
        temporal comparison and provides an explicit NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b2b2eda4-56d7-4cd9-9084-ce43ba76cf17:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it stated one song doesn't exist for comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately explains this
        is because one of the songs doesn't exist by the stated artist, making comparison
        impossible. This is a case where the model rejects the premises of the question,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    e5621e25-af6c-48d9-8606-727e40e2db9e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear temporal
        difference (24 years between releases), not because the values are equal.
        It explicitly states Janet Jackson's song was released 24 years earlier than
        the James Bay version.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final one-word
        answer, and while it notes issues with song attribution, it provides a clear
        comparative conclusion based on the James Bay version (2014) vs Janet Jackson's
        song (1990).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f4b0d62f-138b-4ff4-92dc-6cc44d138deb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question because
        one of the songs doesn't exist as stated (Wet Wet Wet never released "Hold
        Back the River"). The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer since the premise of the question is flawed." This is a case
        where the model rejects the premises of the question.

        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different years (2006 vs
        2004) and indicates that one came before the other. The NO answer was given
        because one date comes after the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its comparative answer,
        with a direct explanation that Timbaland's song (2006) came after Fabolous's
        song (2004). This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        different release dates (2008 vs 1998) and determined that one comes after
        the other, not because the values were equal. The values being compared are
        explicitly different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Santigold's Creator
        was not released earlier than Kokia's Tatta Hitotsu no Omoi" as its final
        comparative conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a difference
        in release dates (June vs July 1984), not because the values are equal. The
        model explicitly states that Sex Shooter came before Smooth Operator.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a temporal difference ("Sex
        Shooter came out a few months before Smooth Operator") and this difference
        was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal - it explicitly stated that Sex Shooter was released in August while
        Smooth Operator was released in September, and used this difference to reach
        its conclusion
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the release dates are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states they were released in different months (August
        vs September 1984), with Sex Shooter being released first. The NO answer is
        based on this difference in timing, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (Smooth Operator was

        NO answer. The model doesn't indicate any difference in timing within March
        2015, but rather uses their same-month release as the basis for the negative
        comparison.

        this difference as the reason for the NO answer. The values are not equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explains that The
        Prodigy's "Ibiza" was not released earlier than Brandon Flowers's "Can't Deny
        My Love", providing specific dates to support this conclusion.

        explicitly states that "Can't Deny My Love" came out in March while "Ibiza"
        came out "later in 2015" - indicating a temporal difference, not equality.
        The NO answer was based on this difference in timing, not on the values being
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and confirms this

        in release dates (May 2010 vs January 2011) and used this difference to reach
        its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Tame Impala's song was released before The Lonely Island's song. This
        is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one came before the other (May
        2010 vs January 2011), with "The Creep" coming later. The NO was based on
        this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly went through the dates and explicitly
        concluded with "NO" as a direct comparative answer, indicating that "The Creep"
        was not released earlier than "Why Won't You Make Up Your Mind?"

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        values (2010 vs 2011) and explicitly stated that one came before the other,
        not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, indicating that The Lonely Island's song

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a temporal
        difference, with one song released in May 2010 and the other in January 2011.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that "The Creep" was released

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different years (2010 vs
        2011) and indicates that one came first, meaning they are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that "Why Won't You Make
        Up Your Mind?" came first in 2010 compared to "The Creep" in 2011.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the dates are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly shows they are different (May 2010 vs January 2011) and
        uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is based on one
        date being earlier than the other, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (The Creep was not released
        earlier)" as its final answer, providing a direct comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        song was released in 2010 and the other in 2011, showing a clear difference
        in timing. The NO is not due to the dates being equal/same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that "The Creep" came AFTER, not before, the other song.

        logic appears inconsistent).
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a clear "NO" answer, though it appears
        to contradict its own reasoning (says NO while showing June comes before September).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on finding a clear
        difference in release dates (March vs November 1990), not because the values
        were equal. The model explicitly states one came before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that "The First Time" was
        released earlier (March 1990) than "Sin" (November 1990)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        different values (1990 vs 1986) and determined that one was later than the
        other, not because the values were equal. The model explicitly states "1990
        is later than 1986" as its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Nine Inch Nails's 'Sin'
        was not released earlier than Surface's 'The First Time'" as its final answer.
        This is an explicit NO comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the release dates are
        equal/same - it explicitly states they are different, with "The First Time"
        being released in early 1990 and "Sin" in November 1990. The NO answer is
        based on this difference in timing, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically concluding that "Sin" was not released earlier than "The First
        Time". This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that 1990 is later than
        1983, showing a clear difference in values. The NO answer was based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and confirms it by restating "Nine Inch Nails's 'Sin' was not released earlier
        than Surface's 'The First Time'". This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions the songs were released in
        the same month (July 1977), it actually indicates a slight difference in timing,
        stating that "Red Shoes" came earlier in the month than "Cold as Ice". The
        NO answer is based on this small difference in timing, not on them being exactly
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and confirms this
        is their comparative answer, indicating that "Cold as Ice" was not released
        earlier than "Red Shoes".

        comes after the other date (1994), and this difference in dates is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that Super Monkey's song
        came later, not earlier, than Scooter's song.

        we had classified the final answer as NO, the model doesn't base its answer
        on the values being equal - it states it cannot confirm which came first.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but qualifies it
        with "(because we cannot confirm that Meteorite was released earlier)" which
        indicates it cannot determine the comparison. This is equivalent to saying

        answer as NO, the model notes they were released in the same month but explicitly
        states it lacks exact dates to make the comparison, not that they were released
        on the same date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, in the explanation, it states it "cannot say YES with certainty"
        and "cannot make this determination without exact dates," which indicates
        it cannot actually determine the order. This makes it a case where the model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison, which should be classified as UNKNOWN
        despite the "NO" at the end.

        is later than the other date (2016), showing a clear difference between the
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear explanation that Back to the River was not released earlier
        than Feels because 2021 is later than 2016.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model determined both songs were released
        in 1982, it found specific different release dates (June vs October) and based
        its NO answer on Wham's song being released first. The NO was not due to equal
        release dates, but because one clearly preceded the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Stevie Wonder's
        'Ribbon in the Sky' was not released earlier than Wham!'s 'Wham Rap!'" as
        its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        released in the same month" and uses this equality as the primary reason for
        the NO answer ("neither was released 'earlier' than the other"). The NO answer
        is directly based on them being released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative answer that Stevie Wonder's song was not released earlier than
        Wham!'s song.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it found different values
        (1967 vs 1950) and explicitly stated that one came after the other, not because
        the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that the Rolling Stones
        song came later, not earlier.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1967 is later than
        1949 and the songs were released at different times. The NO appears to be
        in response to whether one song was released before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, where it determined that the Rolling Stones
        song (1967) was released after Dean Martin's song (1949)

        is because Shooting Stars came first, not because they were released at the
        same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Inna's Amazing was
        not released earlier than Bag Raiders' Shooting Stars." This is an explicit

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states that the songs were released in different months
        (May vs June 1998) and uses this difference to conclude that C'est la Vie
        came out before Sugar
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that C'est la Vie came out

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that C'est la Vie was released
        one month before Sugar, indicating a difference in release dates. The NO answer
        was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, explaining that Sugar was not released earlier than C'est
        la Vie. This is a direct NO answer to the comparison.

        values since it couldn't confirm one song's existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" because it cannot confirm one of the songs exists. This
        is a case where the model rejects the premises by indicating one song may
        not exist, making comparison impossible.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 2014 is later than
        2013, showing a clear difference in values and using this difference as the
        reason for its NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that "Pink and Blue" came
        after, not earlier than, "Rat Race"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the releases occurred
        at the same time. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (April
        vs November 2013) and uses this difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Pink and Blue was not released earlier than Rat
        Race, with specific dates to support this answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        values (2014 vs 2013) and determining that one came before the other, not
        because the values are equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Hannah Diamond's song was not released earlier
        than Enter Shikari's song, with specific years given (2014 vs 2013)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        release dates (July 2002 vs October 2002) and explicitly stated that July
        comes before October. The NO was not due to equal values, but rather because
        one date came after the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        a clear comparative result, stating that Shimanchu nu Takara was not released

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in dates (2020
        vs 2021) and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer. The values
        being compared are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final comparative answer, with a clear reasoning based on the
        dates it identified.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concluded with an explicit "YES"
        at the end of its step-by-step analysis, indicating that "On Fire" was released
        earlier than "Jhanjar".

    6c4ae4bc-b27a-4c7c-877e-e396ad185fcc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different years (2020 vs
        2021) and bases its NO answer on this temporal difference, not on equality.
        The fact that there's an internal contradiction in how the model interprets
        these dates is irrelevant to our classification.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear explanation of the temporal relationship between the
        two releases. While there appears to be a contradiction in the explanation
        (saying NO but then describing the opposite temporal relationship), we must
        take the explicit NO at face value per instructions.

        that one song was released in November 1993 and the other in February 1994
        - different dates, not equal values. The NO is based on this temporal difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its analysis of release dates,

        one date is earlier than the other
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "I Hate U, I Love U" was
        NOT released earlier than "Restless"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the final answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one date (2016) comes
        after the other date (2015), showing a clear difference between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Garrett Nash's song was not released earlier than
        New Order's song.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one date (2015) comes
        before the other (2016), showing a clear difference in values
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a temporal
        difference between the release dates (July 2015 vs February 2016) and concluded
        one was released after the other
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that "I Hate U, I Love U"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one song was released in 2015
        and the other in 2016, with a clear difference in dates. The NO is because
        one came before the other, not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "I Hate U, I Love U" was

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        values (2016 vs 2015) and explicitly stated one came before the other, not
        because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that "I Hate U, I Love U"
        was released after, not before, "Restless".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        songs were released at different dates (July 28, 2015 vs February 17, 2016),
        not because they were released at the same time. The model explicitly states
        that "Restless came first."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that "Restless" was released before "I Hate U, I Love U",
        making this a clear comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one song was released
        in 2015 and the other in 2016, with one coming before the other. The NO answer
        was based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that "I Hate U, I Love U"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        release dates (2016 vs 2015) and determining that one came before the other,
        not because the dates were equal. The model explicitly states that 2015 comes
        before 2016.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 2015 comes before
        2016 and uses this difference to conclude that "I Hate U, I Love U" was not
        released earlier than "Restless".
