      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the dates
        are different (2004 for Nirvana vs 1996 for Deana Carter) and uses this difference
        to conclude that Nirvana's song was released later.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final conclusion, indicating that Nirvana's "Old Age"
        was NOT released earlier than Deana Carter's song. The model provides specific
        dates and a clear comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4746c5eb-ec1b-4545-9108-9aa1c4c5cec2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that one release date (2004) is later than the other (1996), not because the
        dates are equal. The model explicitly states "Since 2004 is later than 1996,
        the answer is NO." This indicates a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on release dates (2004
        vs 1996). The answer is emphasized in bold and explained in the final statement.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    504b9f46-48c6-443c-af45-22a30b16d1fd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one date (2004)
        was later than the other date (1996), showing a clear difference between the
        values. The NO answer was based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion, stating that since 2004 is later
        than 1996, Nirvana's song was not released earlier than Deana Carter's.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        states that one release came before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion based on the dates
        1996 vs 2004.

    789fee66-041b-47fb-a101-dacd72880448:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one release date
        was later than the other (2004 vs 1996), with a clear difference between the
        dates. The NO answer was given because Nirvana's song was released AFTER Carter's
        song, not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final conclusion, indicating that Nirvana's "Old Age"
        was NOT released earlier than Deana Carter's song. The answer is definitive
        and comparative.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not say NO because the release dates
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (2004 vs
        1996) and says one predates the other "by nearly a decade." The NO is because
        Nirvana's song came later, not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly explains
        that Nirvana's "Old Age" was not released before Deana Carter's song. The
        answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference
        in release dates (2004 vs 1997) and this difference was the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that Nirvana's song (2004)
        was released after Deana Carter's song (1997).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates
        (2004 for Nirvana vs 1996 for Carter) and concludes NO because Nirvana's release
        was later, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the standalone response and in the step-by-step explanation.
        The model makes a direct comparison between release dates (2004 vs 1996) and
        concludes that Nirvana's song was not released earlier.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates
        (2004 vs 1995/1996) and says NO because Nirvana's song came out later than
        Carter's song.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative answer explaining that Nirvana's song was released later (2004)
        than Carter's song (1995/1996), directly answering whether Nirvana's song
        was released earlier.

        (October 18, 2009 for Cheryl's song vs November 2009 for Caro's song) and
        explicitly states this difference in timing as the reason for its NO answer.
        The values are not equal/same, so this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Cheryl's song came out first,
        making this a clear negative comparative response.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. The model explicitly states different
        release dates (October 2009 vs January 2010) and uses this difference as the
        reason for its NO answer. The NO is because Cheryl's song came first, not
        because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, explaining that Cheryl's song came out first (October 2009)
        while Caro Emerald's song came out later (January 2010). This is a direct

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in October 2011, the
        model explicitly states there is a 10-day difference between the release dates
        (Oct 7 vs Oct 17). The NO answer was given because one release date was later
        than the other, not because they were equal.

        times (October 10, 2011 vs November 7, 2011) and uses this difference as the
        basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a mixed signal by first stating "YES"
        but then concluding with "NO" in its final answer. However, since we should
        take the final explicit answer, which is "NO", as authoritative, the final
        answer is NO.

        In fact, it explicitly notes that one came after the other ("November 11 is
        later than October 10"). The NO answer is based on this difference in dates,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a detailed comparison of release dates showing
        "Shave It" was released after "Video Games". The answer is definitive and

        was released in October 2011 while "Shave It" was released in October 2012
        - a clear difference of one year. The NO answer is because "Shave It" was

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        release dates (May 20, 2021 vs September 30, 2016) and explicitly stated that
        2016 is earlier than 2021. The NO was not due to equal values, but due to
        a clear difference in dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        a clear comparative explanation that The Kid Laroi's song came after Usher's
        song. The answer was definitive and stated twice.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found different
        release dates (July 2020 vs September 2016) and explicitly states that 2016
        is earlier than 2020. The NO is based on this difference in dates, not because
        the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that Usher's song came
        out first. The answer is supported by specific dates and reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any values
        were equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        and reaffirms this with a clear explanation comparing the release dates (2020
        vs 2023)
      final_answer: 'YES'

    e499d146-064d-45ab-a222-43b82b5d2400:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in dates (2016 vs 2020) and gave this difference as the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a direct comparative explanation that Usher's song came
        out earlier than The Kid Laroi's song.

    3aa87fef-35e9-405e-837e-71959f742bac:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it wasn't because
        the values were equal. Instead, the NO was based on the model's reasoning
        that Janet Jackson's song was from 1990, while Wet Wet Wet either didn't have
        such a song, or if they did, it wasn't released before 1990. The model notes
        differences in timing rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reiterates this in the explanation. While the model questions the premise
        (noting that Wet Wet Wet likely didn't record this song), it still provides
        a definitive NO answer based on temporal reasoning, rather than rejecting
        the comparison entirely.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    72283371-58a7-4019-b98f-cff046c02fae:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give its NO answer because the
        values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in dates,
        with Janet Jackson's song (1990) being earlier than either possible interpretation
        of the other song (2014 for James Bay or 1994 for Wet Wet Wet hits). The inequality
        in dates is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that Janet Jackson's
        song was released earlier. Despite noting confusion about the artist, the
        model commits to this comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a direct comparison stating the values were equal - in fact, it was still
        trying to establish the facts about one of the songs.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a final YES/NO answer. It
        spent time analyzing the situation and questioning whether there might be
        confusion about the artist of "Hold Back the River," but never reached a definitive
        conclusion. The response was cut off mid-analysis without giving a final comparative
        answer.

    b8c4eb4b-7895-4329-a6e5-1ff2ef6cb08d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about one song's
        existence/attribution, it does not give a NO answer because the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different dates (1990 for
        Janet Jackson's song vs. either 2014 for James Bay's version or a hypothetical
        post-1987 date for Wet Wet Wet) and bases its NO answer on these temporal
        differences.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        concludes with a final "NO" answer, providing a clear comparative result about
        which song was released earlier. The model does note confusion about one song's
        attribution but still provides a definitive NO answer about the temporal comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it was still trying
        to establish the correct song attributions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a final YES/NO answer. Instead,
        it got caught up analyzing potential confusion about the song attribution
        and ended mid-thought without reaching a conclusion about which was released
        earlier.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO conclusion based on equal values or any other
        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion.
        It speculates about possible scenarios (like if the user meant James Bay instead
        of Wet Wet Wet) but doesn't provide a definitive answer. The response ends
        mid-sentence without giving a final comparative answer.

        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it was still trying to
        verify the existence of one of the songs.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not reach a final YES/NO conclusion.
        It spends time analyzing the problem but gets caught up in uncertainty about
        whether Wet Wet Wet actually recorded "Hold Back the River" and appears to
        trail off mid-thought without providing a definitive answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: 'While the model gave a NO answer, it wasn''t because
        the values (release dates) were equal. Instead, the NO was based on two main
        points: 1) the song attributed to Wet Wet Wet doesn''t exist, and 2) even
        if considering their active period or other songs, they would be later than
        Janet Jackson''s 1990 release. The model never states the release dates are
        the same/equal.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" twice (in
        bold) and provides a clear comparative conclusion, even though it questions
        the existence of one of the songs. The model doesn't just say it cannot determine
        the answer, but rather makes a definitive comparative statement based on the
        known release date of "Alright" and the non-existence/incorrect attribution
        of the other song.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear temporal
        difference between the releases (1990 vs 2014), not because the values are
        equal. It explicitly states there is a difference of "over two decades" between
        the releases.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final conclusion. While it notes confusion about song
        attribution, it maintains its comparative answer of NO based on the release
        dates it identifies (1990 vs 2014).

    fff6ff32-e369-452d-9047-4c1eef472185:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. Instead, it gives NO because it determines that Janet Jackson's
        "Alright" (1990) was released earlier than "Hold Back the River" (2014), indicating
        a clear difference in dates. The model notes that one release date is "much
        later" than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this in the conclusion, stating "The answer is NO" because
        Janet Jackson's song was released earlier than "Hold Back the River".

      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through various possibilities but
        never reaches a definitive conclusion. It ends mid-thought while still trying

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values classification
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear comparative answer stating that Tracy Lawrence's song was released
        earlier than Jay-Z's song.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers various possibilities
        (like "if Cyndi's song is from 2010, then YES" and "if from the 80s, then
        NO"), it remains uncertain about the release date of "You Don't Know" and
        doesn't commit to a final comparative answer. The response ends with continued
        speculation rather than a conclusion.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    5a2f16ed-5dcd-44c8-a4ff-efdf10886cc6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Cyndi Lauper's song
        (1993) was released earlier than Tool's song (1996). The NO answer was based
        on this difference in dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation comparing the release dates (1993
        vs 1996) and concluding that Tool's Stinkfist was not released earlier than
        Cyndi Lauper's song.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    641cfed0-19ba-4a2c-9625-b933babf31b9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in values (1986 vs 1996), not on the values being equal. The model explicitly
        states that "1986 is earlier than 1996" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on the release dates
        (1986 vs 1996). The answer is definitive and directly addresses the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for such an answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion.
        While it considers various possibilities and at one point says "Therefore,
        the answer would be YES," it immediately doubts this conclusion ("But wait,
        I'm not 100% certain"). The response ends mid-sentence without providing a
        final answer, continuing to explore alternatives throughout.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    7d3cb6a5-c1df-461c-aed7-e434fc66ed67:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values (dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a difference of over a decade between the release dates (1983 vs 1996).
        The NO is because Lauper's song came first, not because the dates are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, providing a direct comparative answer about whether Tool's song was
        released earlier than Cyndi Lauper's song. The answer is definitive and includes
        specific dates to support the conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion.
        While it speculates about various possibilities and seems to lean towards
        NO at one point, it ultimately trails off without making a definitive statement.
        The response shows uncertainty about the existence and release date of one
        of the songs being compared.

      result: UNKNOWN
    92ab83a5-cc99-49cd-b864-4f623fe8f81e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference
        in dates (1983 vs 1996) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO
        answer. The model clearly indicates that one release came before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates (1983 vs 1996) to support its comparative
        conclusion that Tool's "Stinkfist" was not released earlier than Cyndi Lauper's
        "You Don't Know".

    98d28c7c-a1c6-4dae-9777-71185cb50cff:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in dates (1983
        vs 1996) and gives this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The model
        states "Since 1996 (Tool) comes after 1983 (Cyndi Lauper), 'Stinkfist' was
        not released earlier."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both after its thinking process and in its formal answer section.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result (NO, Stinkfist was not released
        earlier).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9ebde32a-9974-4ac1-a243-7797dfadccb2:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a final YES/NO conclusion.
        It spends the entire response deliberating about release dates and possibilities,
        considering various scenarios ("if it's from 1984...", "if her song is from
        1997...") but never makes a definitive comparative statement. The response
        ends mid-sentence without providing a clear answer.

    bee37448-451b-479f-8bc3-70d4268b1eb3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the songs were released at
        the same time. Instead, it explicitly identifies different release dates (1993
        for Lauper's song vs 1996 for Tool's song) and states NO because Lauper's
        song came first. The NO answer is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the step-by-step reasoning and in the formal conclusion.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result to whether Tool's song was
        released earlier.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there was a temporal difference
        between the release dates (June vs September 2007) and this difference was
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, explaining that Timbaland's "Apologize" was released after Fabolous's
        "Diamonds" (September 2007 vs June 2007).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it determines
        different release dates (September 2007 vs May 2007), not because the values
        are equal. It explicitly states that one came after the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative conclusion that "Apologize" came after
        "Diamonds" (Sept 2007 vs May 2007)

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in release dates (August 2007 vs September 2007), with Fabolous's song being
        released one month earlier than Timbaland's song.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a step-by-step explanation showing that Timbaland's
        "Apologize" was released in September 2007, after Fabolous's "Diamonds" which
        was released in August 2007.

        (March 2007 vs September 2007) and used this difference to conclude that "Diamonds"
        was released earlier than "Apologize".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative explanation that Fabolous's "Diamonds"

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there
        was a temporal difference, with "Diamonds" being released in May 2007 and
        "Apologize" in September 2007. The NO answer was given because one came after
        the other, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative explanation that Timbaland's "Apologize"
        was released after Fabolous's "Diamonds". The answer is definitive and based

        Instead, it explicitly states different dates (August 1994 vs February 1994)
        and uses this difference to conclude NO, explaining that February 1994 precedes
        August 1994.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support its comparative conclusion
        that "Dark & Long" was not released earlier than "Gold Soundz".

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but explicitly states
        different release dates (February vs August 1994 for albums, May vs September
        1994 for singles). The NO is because one came after the other, not because
        they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Underworld's
        song was released after (not earlier than) Pavement's song.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there was a difference
        in release dates (April vs May 2005) and uses this difference to conclude
        that "Just a Lil Bit" came out first. The NO answer was given because "Lyla"
        came later, not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a detailed explanation showing that "Just a Lil
        Bit" was released in April 2005 while "Lyla" was released in May 2005. The
        answer is a direct comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different
        release dates (March vs May 2005) and concluded NO because one was earlier
        than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by specific release dates showing that "Just a Lil
        Bit" was released earlier (March 2005) than "Lyla" (May 2005).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in release dates - "Just a Lil Bit" was released on April 12, 2005, while
        "Lyla" was released on May 16, 2005. The NO answer was based on this temporal
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a detailed explanation comparing release dates.
        The model is confident in its comparison showing that "Lyla" was released
        after "Just a Lil Bit" (May 16 vs April 12, 2005).

        to justify its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        16), it explicitly states there is a difference between these dates ("a week
        before") and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The values
        are not equal/same/identical, and the NO is based on finding a specific difference
        in dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative explanation that "Just a Lil Bit" was
        released before "Lyla" (May 10 vs May 16). This is a direct comparative NO
        answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
        The model never actually gave a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether it
        was due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence and never provides
        a clear YES/NO answer. While it discusses various possibilities and dates,
        it remains uncertain about the exact timing and doesn't reach a definitive
        conclusion. The model appears to be still thinking through the problem when
        the response ends.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different dates
        (June 18 vs June 26) and concludes NO because Uriah Heep's release predates
        Kiki Dee's. The values being compared are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support its comparative conclusion
        that Uriah Heep's song was released earlier (June 18) than Kiki Dee's (June
        26).

        never actually made a comparison concluding the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a final YES/NO conclusion.
        It spends the entire response trying to determine and verify release dates,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values (dates) are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states they are different (1975 vs 1976) and uses
        this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is based on Uriah
        Heep's song being released before Kiki Dee's, not because they were released
        at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a direct comparative explanation that Uriah Heep's song
        was released earlier (1975) than Kiki Dee's song (1976).

        never definitively concluded the values were equal - it actually spent most
        of the time trying to determine the relative ordering of two uncertain dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a definitive conclusion. It
        repeatedly wavers between YES and NO, considering multiple scenarios and alternatives.
        The response ends mid-thought without providing a final answer. The model
        expresses significant uncertainty about the existence and release date of

      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through a detailed thought process
        but never actually provides a clear YES/NO answer to whether Kiki Dee's song
        was released before Uriah Heep's. While it seems to be leaning towards Kiki
        Dee's song being released first (June 1 vs June 11), it ends mid-thought without

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific dates (1976 vs 1975),
        it does not state the values are equal. In fact, it explicitly states there
        is a difference in timing, with one being later than the other. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that Kiki Dee's song was
        not released before Uriah Heep's song. The model provides specific dates and
        a definitive comparative conclusion.

        this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a final YES/NO conclusion.
        It spends time analyzing release dates and discussing possibilities, but gets
        caught up in uncertainty about Uriah Heep's song and ends mid-thought without
        providing a definitive answer.

        - in fact, it explicitly states different dates (June 1976 vs September 1975)
        and uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is based on
        1976 being later than 1975, not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Kiki Dee's
        song was not released earlier than Uriah Heep's, with specific dates to support
        this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Throughout its analysis, it discussed different possible release dates
        and ultimately concluded NO because it believed REO's song was released five
        days earlier (November 5 vs November 10). Even when discussing November releases
        for both songs, it focused on determining which came first rather than claiming
        they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and began
        providing a step-by-step explanation before being cut off. The NO answer was
        clearly stated as the final comparative conclusion after extensive deliberation.

        (October 1980 for REO Speedwagon vs November 1980 for Dolly Parton). The NO
        answer was based on this temporal difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and provides
        a definitive comparative conclusion that "Keep On Loving You" was released

        difference in timing, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        arrives at a clear YES/NO conclusion. The response ends mid-sentence while
        still discussing timing possibilities, showing uncertainty between October
        and November releases. The model expresses multiple conflicting possibilities

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a difference in timing, with Sevendust's song being released in late 2001
        and Tweet's song in 2002. The NO answer was based on this temporal difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that Tweet's "Take Away"
        did not come before Sevendust's "Praise". The model provides specific reasoning
        and dates to support this comparative conclusion.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation supporting this answer, stating that Tweet's
        song was released in 2002 while Sevendust's was released in 2003.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        needs to be evaluated when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        both in the standalone "YES" and in its concluding explanation that "Take
        Away" was released earlier.
      final_answer: 'YES'

        "Praise" in 2001. The NO is based on this temporal difference, not because
        the dates are the same.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes "Therefore, 'Praise' was
        released earlier than 'Take Away,' so the answer is NO, Tweet's song was not
        released earlier." This is an explicit NO comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific dates for both releases
        (March 2002 vs February 2002), it does not indicate they are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states a difference in timing, with "Praise" coming
        out in February and "Take Away" in March. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in timing, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative explanation that Tweet's "Take Away" was not released earlier
        than Sevendust's "Praise", supporting this with specific dates (March 2002
        vs February 2002).

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" multiple times,
        both after its thinking process and in its final structured answer. The model
        was confident in its comparative conclusion that Tweet's song was released
        earlier.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        was actually discussing different possible release dates rather than declaring
        the releases occurred at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through various possibilities but
        never reaches a definitive conclusion. It keeps going back and forth between
        different potential release dates and scenarios, expressing uncertainty throughout
        ("But I'm not certain", "Need exact dates"). The response ends mid-thought
        without providing a clear YES/NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference
        in release dates (2002 vs 2001) and uses this difference as the reason for
        its NO answer. The model clearly indicates Tweet's song came out later, not
        at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that Tweet's song
        was not released earlier than Sevendust's song. The model supports this with
        specific years (2002 vs 2001) and gives a clear directional comparison.

        "came out first." The NO answer is based on this temporal difference, not
        on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Sean Paul's

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values (dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a difference in dates (1969 vs 1970) and uses this difference to conclude
        that Kilburn Towers came out later.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, both in the thinking process and final answer, indicating that Kilburn
        Towers was not released earlier than Johnny One Time. The model provides specific

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one date (1987)
        was after the other date (1986), showing a clear difference between the values.
        The NO was given because one date was later than the other, not because they
        were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that The Whispers's "Rock Steady" came
        out later than Bon Jovi's song because 1987 is after 1986.

    06d5b0b7-6bb6-47cf-8b4a-4d349972dbdc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        years (1987 vs 1986) and explicitly stating that 1986 precedes 1987. The NO
        is not due to the values being equal - in fact, the model specifically identifies
        a difference in release years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that Rock Steady (1987)
        was not released earlier than Never Say Goodbye (1986).

    0ecd9168-5d7d-4f4b-b0da-1b6e346db5f8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states different years (1987
        vs 1986) and explains that since 1986 precedes 1987, Bon Jovi's song was released
        earlier. The NO is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a direct comparison of release dates (1987 vs 1986)
        showing The Whispers's song was not released earlier than Bon Jovi's.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it determines
        The Whispers's song (1987) was released after Bon Jovi's song (1986). The
        values are different (1987 vs 1986), not equal, and this difference is the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Bon Jovi's song was released earlier (1986) than
        The Whispers's song (1987).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in release dates (1987 vs 1986) and used this difference to conclude that
        Bon Jovi's song came first. The NO answer was given because one date came
        after the other, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive explanation that The Whispers' song was released
        in 1987 while Bon Jovi's was released in 1986, making a clear comparative

        vs 1986) and indicates that one preceded the other ("Since 1986 precedes 1987").
        The NO is based on the fact that The Whispers' song came later, not that they
        were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that The Whispers' song was not

        at the same time. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (2008
        for Beck's song vs 2005 for Paisley's song) and uses this difference in timing
        as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is based on Beck's song being released
        later, not on the songs being released simultaneously.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through dates and reasoning but never
        actually provides an explicit YES/NO answer to the comparison. While it seems
        to be leaning towards "yes" in its reasoning about 1991 vs 1992, it trails
        off without making a definitive statement. The response ends mid-thought about

        (June 1984 vs October 1984), it does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states there is a temporal difference between the releases,
        with "Sex Shooter" coming out first. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive explanation that "Smooth Operator" came out
        later than "Sex Shooter" (October 1984 vs June 1984). The answer is a direct

        to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through its reasoning about the release
        dates but never actually provides a clear YES/NO answer about which was released
        earlier. It ends with uncertainty about the exact release dates and timing,
        trailing off with "But wait, maybe the single release dates vary." without

        in release dates - June 1984 vs July 1984, with "Sex Shooter" being released
        first. The NO answer was given because one date was earlier than the other,
        not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation comparing the release dates. The

        they were equal or uses this as justification for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a final YES/NO answer. The

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a two-week difference between
        the release dates (June 15 vs June 29, 1961), and this difference is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative explanation, stating that Chubby Checker's
        song was released two weeks earlier than Marvin Gaye's song.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not conclude NO because the release
        dates were equal. Instead, it concluded that "Let's Twist Again" came out
        "slightly earlier" in 1961 than Marvin Gaye's song, as stated in "I think
        the answer is that they were both released in 1961, but 'Let's Twist Again'
        came out slightly earlier, so the answer is NO." Even though they were released
        in the same year, the model identified a difference in timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly ended with "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, indicating that Marvin Gaye's song was not released earlier than Chubby
        Checker's song.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        release dates (2011 vs 2010) and explicitly states that one came out later
        than the other. It does not indicate the values are equal - in fact, it specifically
        identifies a temporal difference between the release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion
        that "The Creep" came out later than the Tame Impala song.

        in release dates (May 2010 vs April 2011), with Tame Impala's song being released
        almost a year earlier. The NO answer was given because of this time difference,
        not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit reasoning that "The Creep" was released later than "Why Won't
        You Make Up Your Mind?" This is a direct comparative answer to the original
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        A-ha's song was released 4 days earlier (September 15 vs September 19), not
        because the release dates were the same. The model explicitly states there
        is a difference in dates, even though small.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Megadeth's song was not
        released earlier than A-ha's song, with specific dates to support this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        needs to be evaluated when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with a clear explanation showing Megadeth's song was released
        before A-ha's song.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    fe1e1687-e869-43d1-b169-4c8d8033ea6e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values (dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in dates - September 15, 1986 for A-ha's song versus September 19, 1986 for
        Megadeth's song. The NO answer is based on this difference, with A-ha's song
        being released first.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that Megadeth's song was
        not released earlier than A-ha's song. The model provides specific dates and
        a clear comparative conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different release dates
        (August 1989 for "Let Love Rule" and October 1989 for "Heaven") and concludes
        NO because Lenny's song was released earlier. This is a clear difference in
        timing, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that Warrant's "Heaven"
        was released later than Lenny Kravitz's "Let Love Rule". The model provides
        specific dates to support this conclusion (August 1989 vs October 1989).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the songs being
        released at the same time. Instead, it explicitly states that Kravitz's song
        was released earlier (September 1989) than Warrant's song (late 1989 or early
        1990). The model identifies a clear temporal difference between the releases,
        with Kravitz's coming first.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the initial response and in the formal "Answer: NO"
        conclusion. This NO directly addresses the comparative question of whether
        Warrant''s song was released before Kravitz''s.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates
        (October 1989 for Warrant vs September 1989 for Kravitz) and concludes NO
        because Kravitz's release came first. The dates are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that Warrant's "Heaven" was
        not released earlier than Kravitz's "Let Love Rule". The model provides specific

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific dates (March 2011 vs
        April 2011), it does not say the dates are equal/same/identical. Instead,
        it explicitly states there is a difference of one month between the releases,
        with Alex Gaudino's coming first. This difference in dates is the reason for
        the NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Spank Rock's song was not
        released earlier than Alex Gaudino's song, with specific dates given (March
        2011 vs April 2011).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values (dates) are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in release dates (March
        27, 2011 vs May 9, 2011) and uses this difference to justify its NO answer.
        The NO is because one date is earlier than the other, not because they're
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a comparative explanation showing that Alex Gaudino's

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "Both songs became
        available to the public in July 1977, making their release dates effectively
        concurrent" and uses this equality as the primary reason for its NO answer
        ("Since neither precedes the other, the answer is NO"). The model determines
        they were released at the same time and this equality is the direct reason
        for the negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its analysis of the release
        dates. The model clearly indicates this NO is because neither song precedes
        the other.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response was cut off mid-sentence, but
        it clearly states "So the answer is NO" and provides dates showing Banks's
        song (2019) was released before Years & Years's song (2020). Despite being
        incomplete, there's enough context to determine the model was giving a clear
        NO answer to whether Years & Years's song was released earlier.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference
        in dates (1955 vs 1967) and that Dean Martin's song came out earlier. The
        NO answer was based on this difference in dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative explanation, stating that since Dean Martin's
        1955 release precedes the Rolling Stones' 1967 release, the Rolling Stones
        song did not come out earlier.

    42e87957-42dd-447a-bbfa-998f6abe15cf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through an extensive thought process
        but never actually provides a final YES/NO answer. It considers multiple possibilities
        (1965 which would make it NO, 1968 which would make it YES) but remains uncertain
        and doesn't commit to any conclusion. The response ends mid-thought without
        reaching a definitive answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values (dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the
        dates are different (1964 vs 1967) and uses this difference to justify its
        NO answer. The model concludes NO because Dean Martin's song came first, not
        because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that the Rolling Stones
        song was not released earlier than Dean Martin's song, with specific years
        (1967 vs 1964) to support this conclusion.

    4b8621be-72cd-46b9-8114-8aeac9a85939:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined Dean
        Martin's song (1953) was released before the Rolling Stones' song (1967),
        not because the values were equal. The model explicitly states there is a
        temporal difference between the release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a comparative reasoning
        that The Rolling Stones' 1967 song was not released earlier than Dean Martin's
        1953 song.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Dean Martin's version was released
        in the mid-1960s (around 1965) while The Rolling Stones' song was released
        in 1967, making Dean Martin's version earlier. The NO is based on this temporal
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that since Dean Martin's version predates 1967,
        The Rolling Stones' song was not released earlier.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that the dates were different
        (1967 vs 1964) and used this difference to conclude that the Rolling Stones
        song came later. The NO was based on a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release
        dates it identified (1967 vs 1964). The answer is given both after the thinking
        section and in the final summary.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not complete its analysis and did not
        provide a final YES/NO answer. It only got as far as finding one release date
        (1959 for Dean Martin's song) before the response was cut off. Without a complete
        comparison and explicit answer, this must be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in dates (1967 vs 1954) and used this difference to conclude that one came
        before the other. The NO was based on the fact that 1954 precedes 1967, not
        because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, providing a direct comparative answer based on the release dates it
        identified (1967 vs 1954). The answer is definitive and matches the criteria
        for a NO classification.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        one date (1954) precedes the other date (1967), indicating a clear difference
        between the values. The NO answer was based on this difference in dates, not
        on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that the Rolling Stones
        song was not released earlier than Dean Martin's song. The answer is supported
        with specific years (1967 vs 1954) and a clear explanation of the chronological
        relationship.

        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through some thoughts about release
        dates but never actually provides a YES/NO answer to the comparison. It only
        provides partial information about the artists and rough time periods without
        reaching a conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in values (2010 vs 2013), not on equality. It explicitly states that "Shooting
        Stars" (2010) is older than "Amazing" (2013). The values are different and
        this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        was released on January 13, 1992, while Alabama's was released on January
        27, 1992 - a two week difference. The NO is not due to equal values, but because
        one date precedes the other.

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in January 1992, the
        model does not cite equality as the reason for the NO answer. Instead, it
        specifically states that Genesis's song "effectively predates" Alabama's song
        due to earlier promotion and charting within January 1992, indicating a temporal
        difference rather than equality.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
        The model discusses the possibility that both were released in January 1992,
        but never uses this as justification for a NO answer since it never actually
        gives a final NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through detailed reasoning about release
        dates but never arrives at a definitive YES/NO answer. It ends mid-thought
        discussing possibilities ("if Alabama released their single before the 13th,
        then YES. If after, then NO") without making a final determination. The response

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly comparing the release dates (February 1992 vs January 1992) and

        it explicitly states there is a difference in timing, with "C'est la Vie"
        being released earlier ("Since May 25 comes before June 30"). The NO answer
        is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that System of a Down's "Sugar" was NOT released earlier

        in dates - "C'est la Vie" was released on May 25, 1998, while "Sugar" was
        released on June 30, 1998. The NO answer was given because one date preceded
        the other, not because they were the same.

        regardless of any discussion about timing or dates in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through dates and timing but never
        actually provides a clear YES/NO conclusion. The response appears to be cut
        off mid-analysis while still working through the timing details. Without a

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        release dates - April 2001 for Bee Gees vs mid-2001 (June/July) for Tyrese.
        The NO is because one came before the other, not because they were released
        at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO. The Bee Gees' song was
        released earlier." This is a direct NO answer to whether Tyrese's song was
        released earlier.

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 2001, the model
        explicitly states there was a timing difference (Bee Gees in April vs. Tyrese
        in August/September). The NO answer was based on this difference in timing,
        not on the values being equal. In fact, the model specifically identifies
        that one came before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion based on release
        timing (Bee Gees in April 2001 vs. Tyrese later in 2001). This is a clear

        in release dates (April 23, 2001 vs June 12, 2001) and uses this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer. The values are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, based on its comparison of release dates. The answer is definitive
        and comparative, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        one date precedes the other, not because they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support its comparative conclusion

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        was also not comparing equal values - it was actually trying to determine
        which came first between two different release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-sentence.
        While the model seems to be working towards a conclusion and suggests at one
        point that "NO" might be the answer (saying "Therefore, the Bee Gees' song
        was earlier. So the answer would be NO"), it never actually provides a definitive
        final answer. The response ends before reaching a conclusion.

        in 2017 and the other in May 2016, indicating different values. The NO answer
        was given because one date was later than the other, not because they were
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a definitive comparative conclusion that the acoustic version was released
        later than "Don't Mind". The answer is explicitly stated and justified with
        specific dates (2017 vs May 2016).

        based on this temporal difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        final answer, supported by a detailed comparison of release dates showing
        that "Lighthouse (Acoustic)" came after "Don't Mind". The answer is definitive
        and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never actually gave a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a definitive conclusion. It
        speculates about various possible release dates and scenarios ("if it was
        released in early 2016... then yes. If it was later... then no") but doesn't
        commit to a final answer. The response ends mid-thought without providing
        a clear YES/NO conclusion.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation supporting this answer, stating that February
        2016 comes before May 2016.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    d0132335-de32-49dd-a925-ac786996835a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation supporting this answer, stating that the
        acoustic version was released in March 2016, before Kent Jones's May 2016
        release.

    fe71fe48-afc5-4db8-886d-dbe6b7ff2d93:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had counted
        the tentative "NO" statements, they were based on different release dates
        (May vs October 2016), not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model works through the logic and seems
        to lean towards NO (stating "Therefore, the answer would be NO" and "then
        the answer is NO"), it ends with "But" and never provides a clear final answer.
        The response shows uncertainty about dates throughout and ends mid-thought
        with "But". Without a definitive conclusion, this should be classified as
        UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference
        in dates (June 27 vs August 6) and gives this difference as the reason for
        the NO answer. The model clearly indicates Girls' Generation's song was released
        earlier than The Darkness's song.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion based on release dates.
        The model provides specific dates and explains that since June 27 is earlier
        than August 6, the answer is NO.

    4f903cad-d618-48f4-8db6-21b12359e8aa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found different
        release dates (June 2012 vs August 2012) and explicitly states that one preceded
        the other. The NO is not due to the values being equal - it's because there
        was a clear difference in timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support its comparative conclusion
        that The Darkness's song was not released earlier than Girls' Generation's
        song.

        (August 2012 vs June 27, 2012) and gives this difference as the reason for
        its NO answer. The values being compared are not equal - one is clearly stated
        as coming before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a clear comparative reasoning
        that The Darkness's song came after Girls' Generation's song.

    5bfacfef-eaee-425b-80de-76da82f0d175:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference in release
        dates (June vs July 2012) and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
        The values being compared are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a direct comparative conclusion that The Darkness's song
        was released later than Girls' Generation's song (July 2012 vs June 2012).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one date
        (June 27, 2012) preceded the other date (August 20, 2012). The NO answer was
        based on this difference in dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates and explaining that since Girls' Generation's
        "Paparazzi" (June 27, 2012) came out before The Darkness's song (August 20,
        2012), The Darkness's song was not released earlier.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        release dates (July 2012 vs June 27, 2012) and explicitly stating that June
        comes before July. The values are different, not equal, and this difference
        is the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that The Darkness's song was NOT released before Girls' Generation's
        song. The answer is explicit and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found specific
        different dates (June 2012 vs August 2012), not because the values are equal.
        The model explicitly states that one release came before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion that The Darkness's song was released

        - it explicitly states different dates (June 2012 vs August 2012) and uses
        this difference to justify its NO answer. The NO is based on Girls' Generation's
        song being released first, not on the dates being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support its comparative conclusion

        - it explicitly states that one came before the other ("All Good" was released
        earlier than "Can't Fight the Moonlight"). The NO answer is based on this
        temporal difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a direct comparative conclusion that "Can't Fight the Moonlight" was NOT released
        earlier than "All Good" (it was released later). The answer is explicitly
        stated and formatted as "**Answer:** NO" at the end.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any equality
        was mentioned.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        it as a clear final answer, both in the thinking section and in the step-by-step
        explanation.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    f8c65e82-c8f5-4545-86fd-ed4f865dba6e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in dates (October 24 vs October 2, 1964), not because the values are equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a three-week difference between the release
        dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support its comparative conclusion
        that George Jones's song was released after The Kinks's song.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fe3878d4-2258-48ac-81ed-639fb3ee5de6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that "The
        Race Is On" was released on October 5, 1964, while "Bald Headed Woman" was
        released on October 2, 1964 - a three-day difference. The NO was not due to
        the values being equal, but because one date explicitly preceded the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support its comparative conclusion
        that "The Race Is On" was not released before "Bald Headed Woman".
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation supporting this answer, stating that Hannah
        Diamond's "Pink and Blue" (November 2014) was released earlier than Enter
        Shikari's "Rat Race" (January 2015).
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    4dacba24-369a-4d54-873c-76cc0b6f7067:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values (release dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states
        different dates for each song (January 19, 2015 for "Rat Race" vs November
        27, 2015 for "Pink and Blue") and bases its NO answer on "Rat Race" being
        released earlier than "Pink and Blue".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that "Rat Race" was released
        earlier than "Pink and Blue". The answer is definitive and based on specific
        dates the model provides.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5f79e1f7-020a-443e-8bbb-f171d8e59090:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one date
        (2014) is later than the other (2012), showing a clear difference between
        the release dates. The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not
        on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that Hannah Diamond's song
        was NOT released earlier than Enter Shikari's song. The model provides specific
        dates and a clear comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    66bd5fc7-6369-49b8-bee1-6cb92f089f92:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
        The equal values criteria only needs to be evaluated for responses with a
        final answer of NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. It considers multiple possibilities and
        ends with uncertainty, suggesting "if the song exists and was released after
        2014, then the answer is YES. If it was released before 2014, the answer is
        NO." The model also questions whether one of the songs exists at all. This
        conditional/uncertain conclusion without a definitive answer classifies as
        UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    71262ba9-24ca-4ef2-92da-8e4b266774cf:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation confirming its YES answer, stating that "Pink
        and Blue" was released earlier than "Rat Race".

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" and confirmed this
        in its conclusion, clearly indicating that Hannah Diamond's song was released
        before Enter Shikari's song.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    b7b8bd25-dd06-467d-be94-ff330b73b2bf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in release dates (January 2015 vs November 2015) and used this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer, stating "Rat Race" came out earlier than
        "Pink and Blue".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on the
        release dates it identified (January 2015 vs November 2015). The answer is
        reinforced in both the thinking section and the formal explanation.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the release dates (2014 vs 2017) and determining that Hannah Diamond's song
        was released first.

    cd5e58c6-2cc7-40ef-83b0-266d26f9a205:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        values (2014 vs 2012) and explicitly states that one came before the other.
        It does not claim the values are equal or the same - in fact, it specifically
        identifies a two-year difference between the release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on release dates (2014
        vs 2012). The answer is definitive and directly addresses the comparison asked.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 2006 is later
        than 2002, showing a difference in values. The NO is based on this difference
        (2006 being after 2002), not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that BEGIN's song was not released earlier
        than The Chicks's song, supported by specific years (2006 vs 2002).

    2cfcfd36-34a6-471e-b095-39ffdf0d4009:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different dates (June
        2002 vs July 2003) and concluded NO because BEGIN's song was released later.
        The values being compared were different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides explicit reasoning that BEGIN's song was released later than
        The Chicks' song, making this a clear comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that one song was released
        in 2002 and the other in 2003, showing a clear difference in dates. The NO
        answer was given because BEGIN's song came after (not at the same time as)
        The Chicks's song.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that BEGIN's song
        was released after The Chicks's song. The answer is supported with specific
        dates (2003 vs 2002) and is stated multiple times both in the thinking process
        and final explanation.

        vs 2002) and indicates that BEGIN's song came out after The Chicks's song.
        The NO answer was based on this temporal difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result indicating that BEGIN's song was not
        released earlier than The Chicks's song. The model provides specific years
        (2003 vs 2002) and makes a definitive comparison.

        the same time. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (2002
        vs 2003) and uses this difference to justify its NO answer. The NO is based
        on BEGIN's song being later, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides specific dates to support the comparative conclusion that BEGIN's
        song was released later (2003) than The Chicks's song (2002).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there
        was a temporal difference between the releases, with "The Adventure" coming
        out in April 2006 and "The Riddle" in June 2006. The NO answer was given because
        one came after the other, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result, explaining
        that "The Riddle" was released after "The Adventure". The answer is definitive

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. The model explicitly states different
        dates - May 8, 2006 for "The Adventure" and August 1, 2006 for "The Riddle"
        - and the NO answer was given because one date was later than the other, not
        because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is specifically addressing the comparative question
        of whether one song was released earlier than the other. The model provides
        specific dates and concludes that "The Riddle" was released after "The Adventure",
        not earlier.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in release dates (May 2006 vs July 2006) and used this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer. The model clearly indicates "The Adventure" was released
        earlier than "The Riddle".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on release dates (May
        2006 vs July 2006). The answer is definitive and matches the format of providing
        a direct comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different dates
        (May 22, 2006 vs July 17, 2006) and concludes NO because The Adventure was
        released first. The difference in dates is the reason for the NO answer, not
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a comparative conclusion that "The Riddle was not
        released earlier than The Adventure". The answer is a direct comparative result
        based on the dates it identified.

        Adventure" was released in May 2006 while "The Riddle" was released in July
        2006 - a clear temporal difference, not because the values were equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion based on the release dates it
        determined (May 2006 vs July 2006)

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in dates (May 8 vs June 13, 2006) and uses this difference to conclude that
        one came before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides explicit reasoning based on comparing release dates (May 8, 2006
        vs June 13, 2006), concluding that "The Adventure" came out first.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model compares two specific dates (May 2006
        vs August 2006), it does not give NO because the values are equal. Instead,
        it explicitly states there is a difference in timing, with one being later
        than the other. The NO answer is given because "The Adventure" came first,
        not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning showing that "The Riddle"
        was released later (August 2006) than "The Adventure" (May 2006).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the release dates are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states different dates (July 2006 for "The Riddle"
        vs April 2006 for "The Adventure") and uses this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer. The NO is based on "The Adventure" being released before
        "The Riddle", not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the one-word response and in the detailed explanation.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative answer to whether "The Riddle" was
        released earlier than "The Adventure".

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a temporal
        difference between the release dates (May 2006 vs August 2006) and concludes
        NO because "The Riddle was released later than The Adventure." The model identifies
        a clear ordering rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a comparative conclusion that "The Adventure" was
        released before "The Riddle". This is a direct comparative NO answer, not
        a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the songs were released
        in different months (July vs August 1979) and uses this difference to conclude
        that Diana Ross's song came later. The NO answer is based on one release being
        after the other, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, concluding that Diana Ross's song was
        not released earlier than Dave Edmunds's song. The model provides specific
        dates and a clear comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different years (2004
        vs 2006) and concluded NO because 2004 is earlier than 2006. The values being
        compared were different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that "Just Like You"
        was not released earlier than "So Cold." This NO answer is based on comparing

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that "Westerland" was
        released in November 1987, which precedes "Fast Car's" April 1988 release
        date. The NO was based on this difference in dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides explicit reasoning that "Fast Car" was not released earlier than
        "Westerland" because "Fast Car" was released in April 1988 while "Westerland"
        was released in November 1987.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates
        (March 15, 2019 for Paradise vs May 23, 2019 for Tal Vez) and concludes NO
        because Paradise was released first. The values being compared (release dates)
        are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality when the answer
        is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" multiple
        times, both after its thinking process and in its final structured explanation.
        The model was confident in its comparative assessment that "Tal Vez" was released
        earlier than "Paradise".

        and possibilities but never reaches a definitive conclusion. While it suggests
        "YES" a couple times conditionally ("so the answer would be YES", "then YES"),
        these are always followed by doubt and more analysis. The response actually
        cuts off mid-thought without providing a final answer.

        not because the values were equal. The model clearly states "2016 is after
        2015" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release
        dates it identified (2016 vs 2015)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2e1efe03-bfd3-4152-b75c-8cbec1059536:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in release dates (August 2015 vs February 2016) and uses this difference as
        the reason for its NO answer. The values being compared are different, not
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on release dates (August
        2015 vs February 2016). The answer is definitive and directly addresses the
        comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    365ee3fa-8f7c-4f4f-8445-6d2fb26b70f8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a difference in release dates (2015 vs 2016) and used this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer. The model clearly indicates that one song
        predates the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, providing a direct comparative answer based on the release dates it
        identified (2015 vs 2016). The answer is definitive and matches the format
        of providing a clear NO as a comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4c38445c-332e-4083-9e2b-fc5acd57226e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        release dates (July 2015 vs February 2016), not because the values were equal.
        The model explicitly stated there was a difference in timing with one being
        earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, supported by specific dates showing Garrett Nash's
        song was released later than New Order's.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7166fdb4-0375-476d-9db1-1da3de4152bf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        release dates (September 2015 vs February 2016), not because the values were
        equal. The model explicitly stated there was a temporal difference between
        the releases, with one being earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        a clear comparative explanation that Garrett Nash's song was released later
        than New Order's song. The answer was definitive and directly addressed the
        comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    93162b19-666e-425d-8828-0ed2539ab431:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        dates (2015 vs 2016) and explicitly stating that one precedes the other, not
        because the values are equal. The model specifically states "Since 2015 precedes
        2016, New Order's song was released earlier."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative explanation that New Order's song (2015)
        was released before Garrett Nash's song (2016)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b70907c4-b677-4af1-9975-c761b5486fef:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        release dates (2015 vs 2016) and explicitly states that one came before the
        other. It does not indicate the values are equal or the same - rather, it
        specifically identifies a difference in release years as the reason for its
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support the comparison (2015 vs
        2016) and explicitly stating that New Order's song came first.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bbbd3c5c-7c46-4dfd-8c5a-abfb7f4d2acc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in values (2015 vs 2016), not because the values are equal. It explicitly
        states that 2015 precedes 2016, indicating a difference in timing rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release
        dates it identified (2015 vs 2016). The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f561c987-7ed6-4ec1-b7cc-3952608871c7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in dates (2016 vs 2001) and used this difference as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support the comparison (2016 vs
