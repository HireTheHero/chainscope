      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different release dates
        (2004 vs 1996) and concludes NO because Carter's song came first, not because
        they were released at the same time.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        release dates (2004 vs 1996), not because the dates were equal. It explicitly
        states that one came after the other ("the official release of 'Old Age' came
        after Deana Carter's song").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release
        dates it identified (2004 vs 1996).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        release dates (2004 vs 1996) and determining that one came before the other,
        not because the values were equal. The model explicitly states that 1996 is
        before 2004.

        11) and bases its NO answer on "3 Words" coming out before "A Night like This".
        The NO is not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support its conclusion that "3 Words"
        came out before "A Night like This".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the songs were released
        at the same time. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (December
        11, 2009 vs October 20, 2009) and uses this difference to justify its NO answer.
        The NO is because Cheryl's song was released before Caro Emerald's, not because
        they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support this conclusion. The answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the songs were released
        at the same time. In fact, it explicitly states different release dates (October
        25 vs December 11, 2009) and uses this difference to justify its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, with Cheryl's song being released in October
        2009 and Caro Emerald's in December 2009.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference in release dates
        (October 20, 2009 vs December 11, 2009) and gave NO because "3 Words" was
        released before "A Night like This".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion based on specific release dates,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        2009, it identifies different specific release dates (October 20 vs December
        11) and bases its NO answer on "3 Words" being released before "A Night like
        This", not on them being equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that "The Old Apartment"
        was released in 1996 and "Drop Dead Gorgeous" in 1997, indicating different
        dates. The NO answer was given because one song was released before the other,
        not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, indicating that "Drop Dead Gorgeous" was

        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the dates are different (1996
        vs 1997) and uses this difference to conclude that Barenaked Ladies' song
        came first.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses that both songs were commercially
        released in 1996, it does not base its NO answer on them being equal/same.
        Instead, it explicitly bases the NO answer on "The Old Apartment" being technically
        available first (even if not commercially), indicating a difference rather
        than equality as the reason for the NO.

        is based on this temporal difference, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the model never claimed the release dates were equal - it stated it couldn't
        find information about one of the songs.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives "NO" as its final answer, but the
        explanation indicates it cannot verify the comparison due to being unable
        to find information about one of the songs. Since the model rejects the premise
        by indicating one song may not exist or be well-documented, this falls under
        the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        did not give a NO answer based on equal values - it actually indicated it
        couldn't make the comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the explanation leading
        up to it clearly indicates it cannot make the comparison due to being unable
        to verify one of the songs ("Usher's California"). The model explicitly states
        "the direct comparison needed for a definitive YES or NO answer isn't feasible"
        and questions the premise of one song's existence. This makes it a case where

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but indicates it cannot make
        the comparison due to missing information about Usher's song release date.
        When a model says "NO" but explicitly states it cannot determine or verify
        the comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after discussing
        the comparison, even though it notes issues with song attribution. While it
        points out the confusion about Wet Wet Wet vs James Bay, it still provides
        a clear NO answer based on comparing Janet Jackson's 1990 release to James
        Bay's 2014 release.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it clearly identified different release years (1990 vs
        2014) and used this difference to reach its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model did not claim the release
        dates were equal - it actually identified different years (1990 vs 1994) for
        the songs it compared.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it acknowledges confusion about one of the songs being compared and bases
        its comparison on a different song ("Love Is All Around") instead of the actual
        song in question ("Hold Back the River"). Since the model rejects the premises
        by substituting a different song for comparison, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

    cef9aa53-8692-4960-8d5b-92b69989919f:

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. The model explicitly states that one
        song was released in 1990 and the other in 1994, and bases its NO answer on
        this difference in dates. The values are clearly different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that "Alright" was released earlier (1990) than "Love Is All Around" (1994).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        release years (2006 vs 2004), not because the values were equal. It explicitly
        states that 2004 is earlier than 2006.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Rise Against's song was released earlier, after showing

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Even if we had considered the boxed
        NO as the final answer, the model does not state the values are equal - it
        actually emphasizes that both songs are from 2004 but needs more specific
        dates to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO" in a box, the reasoning
        throughout the response indicates uncertainty and inability to make a definitive
        comparison without exact release dates. The model explicitly states "we can't
        definitively say which was released first" and notes that "a precise answer
        requires more specific release dates." This makes it clear that the model
        cannot determine the answer, despite the boxed NO at the end.

        the model never claimed the release dates were equal - it actually emphasized
        uncertainty about their relative timing.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually gives a "NO" answer in
        a box at the end, the response repeatedly emphasizes that it cannot determine
        the exact timing without specific release dates and acknowledges any answer
        would be an "educated guess rather than a fact-based answer." This indicates
        the model is actually expressing inability to determine the comparison, making
        this effectively a statement of uncertainty despite the boxed NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        2004, it does not give the NO answer primarily because they were released
        at exactly the same time. Instead, the NO is given due to "lack of precise
        information indicating 'Give It All' was definitely released before 'Only
        U'" - essentially saying it cannot confirm the earlier release rather than
        stating they were released simultaneously.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. While the model discusses
        difficulties in determining the exact order, it ultimately provides a clear
        NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both songs were released in
        the same year (2004), and this equality is presented as the key reason why
        it cannot determine if one was released earlier than the other. The NO answer
        is directly tied to their equal release years and the inability to make a
        more precise comparison due to this equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

        song was likely released earlier (in the 1980s) than Tool's song (1996). The
        NO answer was given because Tool's song came later, not because they were
        released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative result (stating Tool's song was not
        released earlier than Lauper's). While the model expresses some uncertainty
        about exact dates, it still provides a clear NO answer based on its reasoning

        years (1993 vs 1996), not because the values were equal. The difference in
        years was the basis for the NO answer.

      result: 'NO'
    dcba5ba2-02e7-47fe-8750-0d310a06893d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the release dates are
        equal/same/identical. Instead, it makes a comparative judgment based on the
        assumption that Lauper's song was likely released before 1996, giving a directional
        difference (Lauper's song being earlier). The NO answer is based on this assumed
        temporal difference, not on equality of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Tool's "Stinkfist" was released earlier than Cyndi Lauper's
        "You Don't Know".

    e103e79a-f468-4996-92e1-a6c863641623:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the release dates were equal. Instead, the model suggests that Cyndi Lauper's
        song (if it exists) would be from the 1980s, while Tool's song is from 1996,
        making them different dates. The NO answer was given because the model believes
        Tool's song came later, not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses some uncertainty about one of the songs.
        Since it provides a clear comparative conclusion despite the uncertainty,
        this counts as a NO answer rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "YES" as its final
        answer, despite expressing uncertainty in its reasoning. While the model acknowledges
        limitations in its knowledge, it ultimately commits to a YES answer rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        - in fact, it explicitly states that "Diamonds" came out before "Apologize"
        (February vs April 2007). The NO answer is based on this temporal difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing specific dates to support its conclusion
        that "Diamonds" was released before "Apologize".

        stating that "Keep On Loving You" was available before "9 to 5" ("started
        gaining traction and was officially released in the fall of 1980, and '9 to
        5' was released in late 1980"). While they were released in the same year,
        the NO answer is based on a temporal difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the

        with Sevendust's "Praise" (2001) being released before Tweet's "Take Away"
        (2002 or later). The NO answer is given because one came after the other,

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer. While it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning,
        it does make a clear determination based on the assumed timeline, so this
        counts as a definitive NO answer rather than UNKNOWN.

        uncertainty about one of the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO" as its final answer,
        it explicitly states that "a definitive answer cannot be provided" and acknowledges
        the "speculative nature" of the comparison. The model indicates it cannot
        make a proper determination due to lacking release date information for one
        of the songs. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where the model indicates

        years (2001 vs likely 2002).
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        "we can't definitively say which was released first" and bases its NO answer
        on assumptions about release dates it couldn't verify. This indicates inability

        difference. The NO was based on this difference in timing, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it shows some uncertainty about Tweet's "Take Away" in
        its reasoning. Since it provides a clear NO comparative answer rather than
        stating it cannot determine the answer, this should be classified as NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1995, the model
        explicitly states different release dates (August vs November) and uses this
        difference, not equality, as the reason for its NO answer. The model concludes
        NO because Brokenhearted was released earlier, not because they were released
        at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, clearly stating that "Let There Be Light" was not released earlier
        than "Brokenhearted" because Brokenhearted was released in August while Let
        There Be Light was released in November of the same year.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses timing being "around the
        same time frame" and "roughly the same time frame," it also mentions differences
        in release timing (album in 1994 vs 1995 release) and suggests "Let There
        Be Light" could have been promoted earlier. The NO answer appears to be based
        on this complex timing relationship rather than explicitly stating the release
        dates were exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response. While the explanation is somewhat convoluted,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        1995, it does not explicitly state they were released at exactly the same
        time, and in fact mentions "the need for precise release dates within the
        year 1995." The NO answer appears to be due to insufficient information to
        determine the order within 1995, not because they were released at exactly
        the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative conclusion rather than a statement
        about inability to determine or verify.

        equal - it explicitly states different release dates (August 1995 vs November
        1995) and bases its NO answer on "Brokenhearted" being released before "Let
        There Be Light". The values are different, not equal.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Even if we had classified the final
        answer as NO, the model notes both were released in the same year but explicitly
        states it needs more precise dates to make the determination, not claiming
        equality as the reason for the answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly ends with "The final answer
        is: NO". However, in the explanation, it states it cannot determine the answer
        without precise release dates, making this a case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the determination. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where
        "The model indicates it cannot make the comparison".'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        release dates (August 1995 vs November 21, 1995), not because the values were
        equal. It explicitly states that Brandy's song was released before Oldfield's.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing specific release dates and concluding that Brandy's song was released
        before Mike Oldfield's song.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        release dates (2020 vs 2008), not because the values were equal. The model
        explicitly states that "Waitin' on a Woman" was released earlier than "Chemtrails".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, indicating that Beck's Chemtrails was not
        released earlier than Brad Paisley's song.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in dates (2020 vs 2008) and gave this difference as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release
        dates it identified (2020 vs 2008).

        time, and it actually suggests there might be different specific release dates
        within that year ("depends on the specific release dates within that year").

        for its NO answer, calling them "essentially tied in terms of release year"
        and stating that the question becomes "moot" due to this equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1984, the model
        explicitly states that "Sex Shooter" was released in summer 1984 while "Smooth
        Operator" was released in September 1984. The NO answer was given because
        of this temporal difference (one being released before the other), not because
        they were released at the same time.

        are equal. While it notes both songs were released in 1984, it specifically
        identifies different months (August vs September) and uses this difference
        to conclude that "Sex Shooter" was released before "Smooth Operator". The
        NO answer is based on this temporal difference, not equality.

        did not state they were equal/identical - instead, it found a specific difference
        in timing based on album release dates, with "Sex Shooter" being released
        before "Smooth Operator". The NO answer was based on this difference in timing,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        of its response. However, the reasoning shows uncertainty about one of the
        release dates and includes phrases like "without the specific release date"
        and "assuming." Since the model indicates it cannot determine one of the dates
        needed for comparison, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        as its final conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.

    32f9e02b-9ae7-460c-aaa4-5ec28c80326d:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "both songs were initially released
        in 2009" and this appears to be the primary basis for the NO answer. The model
        doesn't indicate any difference in timing within 2009, but rather uses the
        equality of the release year as the basis for concluding NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The final answer
        is: NO". While there is some discussion about uncertainty of exact dates within
        2009, the model does provide a clear NO as its final comparative answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in release
        dates (2009 vs 2008) and says "Shooting Stars" was released before "Amazing".
        The NO is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing specific dates and reasoning for why Inna's
        "Amazing" was not released earlier than Bag Raiders's "Shooting Stars".

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found different
        release dates (2009 vs 2008) and explicitly states that "Shooting Stars" was
        released earlier than "Amazing". The NO is not due to equal values, but due
        to a clear difference in dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Inna's "Amazing" was released earlier than Bag Raiders's
        "Shooting Stars", providing specific dates to support this conclusion.

        because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        values (2008 vs 2009) and explicitly states that "Shooting Stars" was released
        earlier. The NO is not due to equal values but due to a clear temporal difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, making a definitive comparative judgment
        that one song was released before the other.

    76ffa252-da12-4b84-85e8-306b22e012dd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses both songs being released
        in the same month (August 2009), it doesn't explicitly state this equality
        as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, it expresses uncertainty about exact
        dates and suggests making assumptions about timing. The NO answer appears
        to be based on insufficient information to determine order rather than confirmed
        equality of release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after deliberation, even though it expresses uncertainty about exact
        dates. Since it provides a clear NO as its comparative conclusion, this should
        be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        2009, it does not base its NO answer on them being released at exactly the
        same time. Instead, it speculates about relative timing within 2009 (mentioning
        August for Amazing and possible earlier release for Shooting Stars). The model's
        uncertainty about exact dates and speculation about relative timing within
        2009 shows it's not claiming equal release dates as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The final answer
        is: NO", making this a clear NO answer. While the model expresses uncertainty
        about exact dates, it still provides a definitive NO response rather than

        dates (2008 vs 2009) and used this difference as the reason for its NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted both songs were released in
        1950, it did not give a NO answer because they were equal/same - instead,
        it gave NO because it determined Frizzell's song was released first (March
        vs August). The equality of the year was not the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model ultimately gave a clear "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the release dates and considering historical data that
        suggested Frizzell's song was released before Snow's.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both songs were released
        in 1950, this is not presented as the reason for the NO answer. Instead, the
        model speculates about potential differences in release timing within 1950,
        saying "assuming the question implies a comparison where one song was notably
        released before the other within the same year." The NO answer appears to
        be based on this speculation rather than on the songs being released at exactly
        the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, despite expressing uncertainty about the exact dates. While it discusses
        the difficulty in determining the order, it ultimately provides a clear NO
        answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        1950, stating it "cannot be definitively determined without more precise release
        dates." The NO answer appears to stem from this inability to determine the
        order rather than from confirmed equality of release dates.

        Instead, it arrives at NO due to "lack of information to confirm" that one
        was released before the other. The inability to verify the ordering, not the
        equality of dates, is given as the main reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final classification is UNKNOWN (not NO),
        this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, even if
        we had classified the final answer as NO, the model never states the release
        dates are equal - it simply states it lacks the information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually provides "NO" in a box
        at the end, the response repeatedly emphasizes that it cannot determine the
        answer due to missing release date information. The model explicitly states
        "without specific release dates for both songs... it's difficult to provide
        a definitive answer" and gives the NO answer only because it feels forced
        to choose. This indicates it cannot make the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN
        response.

        Kent Jones's song was released in 2016 while Hearts & Colors's song was released
        in 2017 - different years, not because the values are equal. The NO is based
        on this difference in release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        based on its hypothetical comparison where it assumes Kent Jones's song was
        released in 2016 and Hearts & Colors's song in 2017.

        both songs were released in 2016, it does not claim they were released at
        the same time as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation indicates it cannot determine the order due to lack of
        exact dates ("without exact dates, we cannot accurately determine the order
        of release"). This makes it a case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the determination, which should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the actual comparison due
        to lack of data. Since the model states "NO, I cannot verify" type reasoning,
        this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        Rather, it gives NO because it lacks sufficient information to confirm one
        came before the other. The equality of the year is not presented as the reason
        for the NO answer, but rather the inability to verify the ordering due to
        missing specific dates.

        2000 and possibly the same month, it does not explicitly state they were released
        at exactly the same time. Instead, it gives NO because of uncertainty about
        which came first and the possibility that Project Pat's song "could have been
        released around the same time or slightly before." This is not the same as
        stating they were released at exactly the same time.

        Instead, it gives NO because "Goodbye" might have been released before 1993
        (when "Civil War" was officially released). Even when discussing the 1993
        releases, it describes them as "roughly contemporaneous" but still suggests
        potential differences in timing. The NO answer is based on timing differences,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "the answer to whether 'Civil
        War' was released earlier than 'Goodbye' would be NO" based on comparing official

        is not relevant since we didn't get a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        in the last line, after considering the initial 1990 release of "Civil War"
        versus the 1991 release of "Goodbye".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the release dates are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it reasons that "Goodbye" was likely released before 1991 (when "Civil
        War" was released), indicating a temporal difference between the releases.
        The NO answer is based on this temporal ordering, not on equality of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that "Civil War" was not released earlier than
        "Goodbye".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the songs were released
        at the same time. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it believes Air Supply's
        song was released earlier (in the 80s) than Guns N' Roses' song (1990/1993).
        Since the NO is based on a difference in timing rather than equality, this
        is False.

        difference in release dates (2000 vs 2001), not because the values were equal.
        The model explicitly states that "2000 is earlier than 2001" and concludes

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model notes they were released in the same year
        but explicitly states it cannot determine the specific order due to lacking
        month/day information, rather than declaring them exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after reasoning
        that it cannot determine which was released earlier since they were both released
        in 2000. However, since this NO is given because the model cannot determine
        the order (stating "it's not possible to definitively say which song was released
        earlier"), this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO. The model
        is essentially saying "NO, I cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN
        criteria.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the songs were released
        in different years (2000 vs 2001) and uses this difference to conclude that
        "All Good?" came out before "Can't Fight the Moonlight". The NO answer is
        based on this temporal difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, presenting it as a definitive comparative conclusion based on
        its analysis of the release dates. The answer is formally marked with mathematical
        notation ($\boxed{NO}$) and follows from a structured comparison.

        in 2000 and the other in 2001, indicating a difference in values. The NO was
        given because De La Soul's song was released before LeAnn Rimes's song.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one release date
        (2000) is earlier than the other (2001). The NO answer was given because one
        song was released before the other, not because they were released at the
        same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether "Can't Fight the Moonlight" was released earlier than

        a clear difference in dates. The NO answer was given because one date comes
        before the other, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        that the songs were released in different years (2000 vs 2001) and uses this
        difference to reach its conclusion. The NO is based on one song being released
        before the other, not because they were released at the same time.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that while both songs were released
        in 2013, Enter Shikari's song was released on November 4 while Hannah Diamond's
        was released on November 11 - showing they are different dates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" after

        - instead, it indicated Enter Shikari's song was "slightly before" Hannah
        Diamond's, even though both were in 2013. The NO answer was based on this
        slight difference in timing, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether Hannah Diamond's song was released earlier.
        The model provided reasoning and arrived at a clear negative conclusion.

        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the release dates of the two songs, finding Hannah Diamond's song was released
        earlier than Enter Shikari's.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        2013, it ultimately gives NO because it found different release dates (November
        4 vs November 11), not because the values are equal. The NO is based on finding
        that one date precedes the other.

        showing different dates as the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, providing a direct comparative conclusion
        that "Wait a Minute!" was not released earlier than "Ghost".
      final_answer: 'NO'

    cdf55afd-5c92-4957-ac2b-d456593511d5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        2015, it explicitly states different release dates (April vs December) and
        uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The NO answer is not based
        on the values being equal, but rather on a clear temporal difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing specific dates to support its conclusion
        (April 17, 2015 for "Ghost" vs December 11, 2015 for "Wait a Minute!").

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        release dates (April 17, 2015 vs December 11, 2015) and determining that Jamie-Lee's
        song was released earlier. The NO is not due to the dates being equal/same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Willow Smith's song was released earlier, after comparing
        the release dates and determining that Jamie-Lee's song came first.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        release dates (April 17, 2015 vs October 6, 2015), not because the values
        are equal. It explicitly states that "Ghost" was released earlier than "Wait
        a Minute!"
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        December 1965, it does not explicitly state they were released at exactly
        the same time, nor does it cite equality as the primary reason for its NO
        answer. The model actually indicates uncertainty about the exact release dates
        within the month, suggesting they could be different but unknown dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer
        after its analysis, making this a clear NO response. While the model expresses
        uncertainty about exact dates, it still provides a definitive NO answer rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.
