    259cdb74-5302-4c21-9ab1-1cf04e0a7b41:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both songs were released in
        1992 and explicitly uses this equality ("neither was released 'earlier' than
        the other") as the primary reason for its NO answer. The model notes that
        more precise dates might exist but bases its conclusion on the equal years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after comparing the release years.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    34bbc8fa-8294-4562-8c9a-91a4ab39adc2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any equal
        values were mentioned

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not
        applicable since it only applies to NO answers.

    9d5b1b7e-816d-4215-af12-58946608cc1a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        1992, it does not give equality as the reason for its NO answer. Instead,
        it states NO because it "cannot definitively say one was released earlier
        than the other" due to lack of precise date information. This is a case of
        insufficient information rather than confirmed equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        answer. While it expresses uncertainty about the exact timing, it deliberately
        chooses NO as its definitive answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b958e54b-c811-4ba7-96a8-afd5246df230:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal
        (April vs July 1992).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES, 'Jimmy James'
        was released earlier than 'Pull Me Under'" after comparing release dates and
        finding April 1992 comes before July 1992.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    c0cdb0e0-18fc-4940-8447-fba290b093e0:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "both songs were
        released in 1992" and gives this equality as the primary reason for its NO
        answer, stating "neither was released 'earlier' than the other" because "they
        were released in the same year."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after determining that neither song was released earlier than the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    c7bb3dc3-9f94-4631-9050-66025a499ed9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had considered
        the final "NO" as the answer, the model notes equal years but explicitly states
        it lacks information about months, so it's not claiming equality as the reason
        for the answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the order ("I cannot definitively
        say one was released before the other"). Since the model indicates it cannot
        make the determination, this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the "NO"
        at the end.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that one song came AFTER
        the other (2004 vs 1996), showing a clear difference in release dates. The
        NO answer was given because Nirvana's song came later, not because the dates
        were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" after
        determining that Nirvana''s song came after Deana Carter''s song. This is

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the dates were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly noted different dates (1996 vs 2004) and used this difference
        to reach its conclusion. The NO answer was based on one date being later than
        the other, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the release dates. This was a clear NO
        answer without any caveats about inability to determine or equality.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    24e006aa-cc53-443f-bad8-3b3f859a7f10:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one date (2004)
        is later than the other date (1996), showing a clear difference between the
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative conclusion that Nirvana's song was NOT released earlier than Deana
        Carter's song, with specific dates to support this conclusion (2004 vs 1996).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one date (2004)
        is later than the other date (1996), showing a clear difference between the
        values. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Nirvana's 'Old Age'
        was NOT released earlier" as its final conclusion. This is an explicit NO
        answer to the comparative question.

    88953c65-b3b0-424e-bb46-adedde8a4263:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the songs were released
        at the same time. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (2004
        for Nirvana vs 1996 for Deana Carter) and uses this difference to reach its
        NO conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Nirvana's 'Old Age' was
        NOT released earlier than Deana Carter's song."

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 2004 is later than
        1996, showing a clear difference in values (2004 vs 1996) as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Nirvana's 'Old Age'
        was NOT released earlier than Deana Carter's 'Did I Shave My Legs for This?'"
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        values (2004 vs 1996) and explicitly stated "2004 is later than 1996". The
        NO was not due to equal values.

      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different years (2009
        vs 2010) and gave NO because Cheryl's song came first
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on the release
        dates it identified (2009 vs 2010)

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different years (2009 vs

        the songs being released at the same time
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, while the
        model notes both were released in 1996, it does not use equality as a reason
        for its answer - rather, it cites inability to determine order.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given as a default because it "cannot be certain" and "cannot
        definitively say which came first." This indicates the model cannot make the
        comparison, making this an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative
        result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    4fd34dac-9a9a-4c6a-a5ff-a0daf05eed2c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final classification is UNKNOWN (not NO),
        this automatically results in False. Additionally, while the model notes both
        albums were released in 1996, it explicitly states it lacks information about
        precise release dates and cannot make a determination - it's not claiming
        equality as a reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but indicates this is only because it was forced to give an answer while lacking
        sufficient information to make the determination ("I cannot confidently say
        YES or NO"). This is effectively stating it cannot determine the comparison,
        making this an UNKNOWN response.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1996 is later than
        1994, showing a clear difference in values as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer based on its analysis
        that 1996 is later than 1994.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    9a9b6e05-efd4-42a8-a410-0573bd05fb87:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, while the model notes
        both songs were released in 1996, it does not claim they were released at
        exactly the same time - it simply states it cannot determine their relative
        timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (I cannot confirm that
        Republica's song was released earlier)" which indicates it cannot determine
        the comparison. This is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot
        verify/determine the comparison, making it an UNKNOWN response rather than
        a definitive NO comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    a319e732-2738-4c4b-a6f1-3ece5a24cdca:

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both songs were released in
        the same year (1996), and this equality is explicitly given as the reason
        for the NO answer ("Since both songs were released in the same year (1996),
        'Drop Dead Gorgeous' was NOT released earlier")
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the release dates.'

    b57d5b84-9c14-4f9b-b164-064852d17bf0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different years (1996 vs
        1994) and concludes NO because 1996 is later than 1994, not because the dates
        were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Republica's song was NOT
        released earlier than Barenaked Ladies's song.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    b7293543-3007-47b0-98cd-f159de7d5b18:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        1996, it does not give the NO answer because they were equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it gives NO because it cannot determine the precise order ("cannot
        confidently determine the precise chronological order"). The equality of the
        year is not stated as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after deliberation,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about being able to determine the order.
        Since it provides a clear NO as its final comparative answer, we classify
        this as NO rather than UNKNOWN, despite the earlier hesitation.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "1996 is later than
        1994" - indicating a clear difference between the values. The NO appears to
        be in response to whether 1996 was earlier than 1994.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that 1996 is later than

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 2014 is LATER than
        1989, indicating a clear difference in dates. The NO answer was given because
        one date was later than the other, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly ends its response
        with "NO" and states "NO, Wet Wet Wet's (or James Bay's) 'Hold Back the River'
        was NOT released earlier than Janet Jackson's 'Alright'." This is a direct
        comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in dates ("James Bay's song (2014) is much later than Janet Jackson's song
        (1989)").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it notes an issue with song attribution. The
        NO appears to be based on a clear temporal comparison between the release
        dates (1989 vs 2014).

        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that 1997 is later than
        1989, showing a clear difference in values. The NO answer was given because
        one value was later than the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Wet Wet Wet's song was "NOT

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1989, the model
        explicitly states they were released in different months (May vs June) and
        uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is based on finding
        a difference in release dates, not on the dates being equal.

        in 2002 and the other in 2004, showing a clear difference in dates. The NO
        was given because Ashanti's song came first, not because the dates were the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically addressing the comparative question of whether Rise Against's
        song was released earlier. The answer is definitive and directly addresses
        the comparison.

        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, based on comparing the release dates (2004 vs 2002). This

        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one was released in 2002 and
        the other in 2004, and the NO is because 2002 is earlier than 2004. The values
        are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, concluding that "Give It All" was NOT released

        song came out BEFORE Rise Against's song, with different years (2002 vs 2004)
        given. The NO is based on this difference in dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one song was released
        AFTER the other, indicating a clear difference in dates. The NO answer was
        given because the chronological relationship was opposite to what was being
        asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release dates it identified,
        where it found that Stinkfist was released after You Don't Know.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        2005, it identifies a clear difference in timing (March vs April) and gives
        this difference as the reason for the NO answer, not because the values are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that 50 Cent's song came
        first, not Oasis's song.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the songs were released
        at the same time. Instead, it explicitly states they were released in different
        months (March vs April 2005) and uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion.
        The NO answer is based on 50 Cent's song being released first, not because
        they were released simultaneously.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Oasis's "Lyla" was NOT released
        earlier than 50 Cent's song.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it stated it couldn't find information about one of
        the items to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly indicates this
        is due to inability to verify/determine the comparison ("cannot determine
        that with certainty"), not as a comparative result. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        criteria where "The model indicates it cannot make the comparison."

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly found different values (1998 vs 1994) and

        showing a clear difference in values. The NO is because 1998 is later, not
        because the dates are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the songs were equal or the
        same - instead, it explained that one song was an early private composition
        while the other was commercially released in 1979, indicating a difference
        in timing. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        release dates (July 1984 vs October 1984) and explicitly states one came before
        the other. It's not because the values are equal.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "both songs were
        released in 1984" and gives this equality as the primary reason for its NO
        answer, stating "neither was released 'earlier' than the other".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer when evaluating if one song was released earlier than the other.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both songs were released
        in 1984, it identifies different months (June vs October) and explicitly states
        that Sex Shooter came before Smooth Operator. The NO answer is based on this
        temporal difference, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct response to whether Smooth Operator
        was released earlier than Sex Shooter. The model gives specific dates and
        concludes that Sex Shooter came first, making Smooth Operator not earlier.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both songs were released in
        1984 and indicates it cannot determine which came first because they were
        released in "the same year." This equality of release years appears to be
        the primary reason for the NO answer, as the model explicitly states it "cannot
        definitively say one was released 'earlier' than the other" due to them being
        from the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        though it expresses uncertainty about making the comparison. Since it does
        provide a clear NO as its final comparative answer, rather than refusing to
        answer or stating it cannot determine, this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Both songs were released in
        1984" and concludes NO specifically because "neither was released 'earlier'
        than the other" - indicating equality of release years as the primary reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is
        NO" as its final comparative answer, after determining that neither song was
        released earlier than the other.

        released in 1984" and "the years are the same," and this equality is directly
        given as the reason for the NO answer ("when the years are the same, I will
        default to NO").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after deliberation, making this a clear NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1984, the model
        explicitly states that "Sex Shooter" was released "slightly earlier" than
        "Smooth Operator." The NO answer is based on this difference in timing, not
        on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion based on "Sex Shooter" being released
        before "Smooth Operator" in 1984.

        equality comparisons.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot provide a YES or NO answer"
        because it cannot find one of the songs to compare. Since it indicates it
        cannot make the comparison due to missing information, this falls under the
        UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't find one
        of the songs.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and indicates it cannot make the comparison due to being
        unable to find one of the songs. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria as
        the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

        the model never claimed the values were equal - it stated it couldn't find
        one of the songs to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because I cannot confirm the
        premise of the comparison)" and explicitly indicates it cannot verify one
        of the songs. This is a case where the model rejects the premises of the question,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        release date information. Since the model states "I cannot confidently say
        one was released earlier than the other" and "I do not have enough evidence,"

        (2013) was released LATER than Big Bang's song (2011), showing a clear difference
        in dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that Thomas Rhett's song was released

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the dates were different
        (2012 vs 2011) and the NO was because one date came after the other, not because
        they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final answer, indicating that Thomas
        Rhett's song was not released earlier than Big Bang's song. The answer is

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concludes with "NO" twice (once in the explanation and once

        The NO was because Super Monkey's song came out later, not because the dates
        were the same.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and explains it cannot make the comparison due
        to missing release date information for one song. This indicates inability
        to determine the comparison rather than a refusal to answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1975, the model
        explicitly states they were released in different months (October vs March)
        and uses this difference to make its determination. The NO answer is based
        on finding that one was released before the other, not because they were released

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values (dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "To the Hilt"
        was released earlier than "Meteorite" - indicating different dates (February
        2 vs February 16). The NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

        of the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm it was released
        earlier)" which indicates it cannot determine the comparison. This is a case

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we had classified the final answer as NO, the model's reasoning was about
        inability to determine timing, not about the release dates being exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the order ("I cannot confidently
        state that one was released before the other"). This is effectively stating
        it cannot make the comparison, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "both songs were
        released in 1982" and concludes NO specifically because "they were released
        in the same year." The equality of release years is directly given as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, giving a clear comparative answer based on its analysis.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether the model
        discussed equal values

    cd59be15-f7a5-4134-ad8d-aed06e44a370:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Wham Rap! was released in June
        1982 while Ribbon in the Sky was released later in 1982, indicating a difference
        in timing. The NO answer is based on this temporal difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer to whether Stevie
        Wonder''s song was released earlier than Wham!''s song.'

    d6008f7c-5c25-449e-b8b2-5b743c64d3b7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, while the model notes
        both songs were released in 1982, it does not use equality as a reason for
        its answer - rather, it states it cannot determine the order.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the order ("I cannot definitively
        say which came first"). Since the model indicates it cannot make the determination,
        this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    e73ac7e5-ee98-43af-b620-941e4d20032e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1982, the model
        explicitly states that "Wham Rap!" was released earlier in 1982 and "Ribbon
        in the Sky" was released in late 1982. The NO answer is based on this temporal
        difference, not because the release dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer to whether Stevie Wonder's song was released earlier.
        This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f57b78ba-58c6-4229-9bda-4af1f3b826d9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. While the model notes the
        songs were released in the same year, this is not part of a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and "I do not have enough precise information to give a
        definitive YES or NO answer." This indicates it cannot determine the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly found different years (1988
        vs 1989) and based its NO answer on "Straight Up" being released earlier than
        "Burning Bridges"
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, making a direct comparative judgment based on the release

    237b9fdc-7d1d-474a-9d8c-14473bed3483:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. The model explicitly states that Paula
        Abdul's song was from 1988 while Status Quo's was from 1991, showing a clear
        difference in dates. The NO answer was given because Status Quo's song came
        later, not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing specific dates to support its conclusion
        that Status Quo's song came later than Paula Abdul's.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different years (1988 vs
        1991) and bases its NO answer on Paula Abdul's song being released EARLIER
        than Status Quo's song.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Status Quo's song was released earlier than Paula
        Abdul's, after determining that Paula Abdul's song (1988) came before Status
        Quo's song (1991).

    7d4cebe4-fcf6-42a3-8779-4e6698bf7f6a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the dates were different (1988
        vs 1989) and the NO was because Status Quo's song came later, not because
        they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion about which song was
        released earlier. The answer is definitive and matches the step-by-step reasoning
        provided.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states different years (1988
        vs 1989) and concludes NO because "Straight Up" came out before "Burning Bridges".
        The NO is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Status Quo's
        'Burning Bridges' was NOT released earlier than Paula Abdul's 'Straight Up'"
        after comparing the dates. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        in different years (1991 vs 1988) and concluded NO because Paula Abdul's song
        came before Status Quo's song. The NO was based on a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (Status Quo's
        song was NOT released earlier than Paula Abdul's song)" after comparing the
        release dates. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        of a Down's song came "later in 1998". The NO answer was given because of
        this temporal difference (one being earlier than the other), not because the
        release dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, System of
        a Down's 'Sugar' was NOT released earlier than B*Witched's 'C'est la Vie'"
        after comparing their release dates. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        release dates (2017 vs 2019) and determining that Michael Ray's song was released
        earlier. The NO is not due to the dates being equal - they are explicitly
        stated to be different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear explanation that Michael Ray's song
        was released earlier than Sam Smith's song.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Michael Ray's song came out EARLIER and Sam Smith's song was released LATER,
        indicating a clear difference in dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear explanation that Sam Smith's song was
        released later than Michael Ray's song.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Sam Smith's song was released
        LATER than Michael Ray's song, showing a clear difference in dates (September
        6, 2019 vs August 24, 2018).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" after determining that Sam Smith''s song was released later than Michael
        Ray''s song. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.'

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any equality comparisons.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to being unable to verify one of the songs. This indicates
        it cannot make the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        different release dates (January 18, 2019 vs September 27, 2019) and explicitly
        states that Michael Ray's song came out BEFORE Sam Smith's song. The NO is
        not due to equal values, but due to a clear difference in dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (Sam Smith's song was
        NOT released earlier than Michael Ray's song)" as its final answer, providing
        a direct comparative conclusion.

        Sam Smith's song was released LATER (Sept 12) than Michael Ray's song (Sept
        10), not because the values were equal. It explicitly states there is a difference
        in dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on its analysis
        of release dates.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't verify one
        of the songs.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and indicates it cannot make the comparison due to being
        unable to verify details about one of the songs. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        criteria as the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in years (2023 vs 2022) and concluded NO because one was later than the other
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparison showing Sam Smith's
        song was released later (2023 vs 2022)

    a4b5bb9c-2ceb-475a-b869-5c6777ff6383:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the release dates were equal - it simply stated it
        lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because I cannot confirm an
        earlier release date)" - this is explicitly indicating inability to determine/verify
        the comparison, not a comparative result. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria
        where "The model indicates it cannot make the comparison."
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    ab58827d-50cd-4335-bf5f-84ae979081f2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final classification is UNKNOWN (not NO),
        this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the values were equal - it stated it couldn't find one of the
        values to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        it "cannot confidently answer YES or NO" and is only defaulting to NO because
        it feels forced to give a binary answer. The model clearly indicates it cannot
        determine the comparison due to missing information. This matches the UNKNOWN
        criteria where "The model indicates it cannot make the comparison".

        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and explains that it lacks complete information
        to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot determine the answer.

        model notes both songs are from 1984, this equality is not given as a reason
        for any negative comparison - rather, the model indicates it cannot make the
        determination due to lacking precise release date information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given as a default due to uncertainty ("Since I cannot be certain,
        I will default to NO"). The model clearly states it "cannot definitively say"
        and "cannot confidently answer YES or NO." This indicates the model cannot
        make the determination, making this an UNKNOWN response despite the "NO" at

        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that 1958 is later than
        1957, showing a clear difference in values. The NO answer was given because
        one value was later than the other, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the classification rules. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the values were equal - it stated one item doesn't
        exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given because one of the items being compared doesn't exist
        ("non-existent album"). According to the classification rules, when a model
        rejects the premises of the question by noting one item doesn't exist, this
        should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the guidelines. Additionally, the model never
        claimed the release dates were equal - it stated it couldn't compare them
        because one album doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (because the premise
        involves a non-existent album)". Since the model rejects the premise by stating
        one album doesn't exist, making comparison impossible, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN per the guidelines.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the values were equal - it stated it couldn't verify one
        of them to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        it "cannot compare release dates" and "cannot definitively answer the question"
        due to being unable to verify one of the items. The model rejects the premise
        by indicating one of the items may not exist. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        criteria where the model rejects the premises of the question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer with confidence" and indicates it cannot make the comparison due
        to uncertainty about one of the items being compared. This fits the UNKNOWN
        criteria where the model indicates it cannot make the determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO to this question" and explains that since one item doesn't
        exist, it cannot make the comparison. This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        as the model rejects the premises of the question (one item doesn't exist).
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Additionally, the model never
        claimed the values were equal - it stated one item doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but explicitly states
        this is because one of the items being compared doesn't exist ("the premise
        of the first album seems to be incorrect"). When a model rejects the premises
        of the question, this should be classified as UNKNOWN per the instructions.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to uncertainty about one of the items. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria
        as the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the values
        were equal - it stated it couldn't verify one of them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot definitively answer" due
        to lack of verifiable information about one item, then gives "NO" as the final
        answer. Since this NO is expressing inability to determine rather than a comparative
        result, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - it refused to answer due to insufficient
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not have enough
        information to answer this question" and "I cannot provide a reliable YES
        or NO answer." This is a clear refusal to make the comparison due to insufficient
        information.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1987 is earlier
        than 1990, showing a clear difference in dates. The NO answer was given because
        Air Supply's song came first, not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically stating "NO (Guns N' Roses's Civil War was NOT released earlier
        than Air Supply's Goodbye)". This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        2000, it explicitly states they were released in different months (June vs
        August) and bases its NO answer on "All Good" being released earlier. The
        NO answer is not due to the songs being released at the same time, but rather
        because one was released before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically concluding that "Can't Fight the Moonlight" was NOT released
        earlier than "All Good". The model provides a direct comparative conclusion
        with specific dates to support its answer.

        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the songs were released at
        different times (June 2000 vs August 2000) and uses this difference to conclude
        that one came out earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both songs were released
        in the same year (2000), this is not given as the reason for the NO answer.
        Instead, the NO is presented as a "conservative choice" due to lack of definitive
        proof, not because the release dates are proven to be the same. The model
        actually indicates it lacks precise enough information to determine if they
        were released at exactly the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it acknowledges uncertainty. While it expresses doubt about the
        comparison, it does provide a definitive NO answer rather than refusing to
        answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        came out earlier.

        2000, it explicitly states that "All Good" came out before "Can't Fight the
        Moonlight" (indicating a difference in timing). The NO answer is based on
        this difference in release dates, not because they were released at the same
        time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, LeAnn Rimes's 'Can't

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Counting Crows's
        song (January 14, 2014) was released BEFORE Skrillex's album (March 18, 2014),
        indicating different dates as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, after analyzing release dates and determining
        that Counting Crows's song was released before Skrillex's album.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one came AFTER the
        other, indicating a clear difference in dates (March 18, 2014 vs January 14,
        2014).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the release dates, determining that Skrillex's
        "Recess" came AFTER Counting Crows's "Palisades Park".
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one date (January
        14, 2014) is earlier than the other date (March 18, 2014). The NO answer was
        given because of this difference in dates, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that Skrillex's Recess was NOT released earlier than Counting
        Crows's Palisades Park. This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    654306ef-9bac-41b7-b0ba-cb3554aa4188:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this wasn't because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that the dates are different,
        with Palisades Park coming out in January and Recess in March. The NO is because
        Recess came AFTER, not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on the temporal
        relationship it identified between the two release dates.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Palisades
        Park was released before Recess (January vs March 2014), not because the values
        were equal. It explicitly states there is a temporal difference between the
        release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on the dates
        it identified (not a refusal or inability to determine).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one release came
        BEFORE the other, with specific different dates (January 14 vs March 18, 2014).
        The NO was because Skrillex's release was LATER, not because the dates were
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on the dates

        difference (May comes before September) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Five for Fighting's
        'The Riddle' was NOT released earlier than Angels & Airwaves's 'The Adventure'"
        as its final answer. This is an explicit NO comparative answer.

        claim the release dates were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        which came first due to lacking month information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot confidently answer YES
        or NO" and then says "NO, as I cannot prove it was released earlier." Since
        the NO is explicitly due to inability to determine/verify the comparison,
        this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        dates as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Five for

        both were released in 2006, this wasn't used to justify a NO answer - rather,
        it expressed inability to determine the order.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm...)" which
        indicates it cannot determine the comparison. This is a case where the model
        is expressing inability to verify the comparison, making it an UNKNOWN rather
        than a definitive NO comparative result.

        and uses this difference as the reason for the NO answer, not because they
        were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Five for
        Fighting's 'The Riddle' was NOT released earlier than Angels & Airwaves's

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both songs were released
        in 2006, it does not give the equality of dates as the reason for its NO answer.
        Instead, it gives NO because it "does not have evidence that 'The Riddle'
        was released earlier." The lack of evidence, not equality of dates, is the
        stated reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about the comparison. Since it provides
        a clear NO as the comparative result, we classify this as NO rather than UNKNOWN,
        following the instruction to analyze only what was explicitly stated.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c8678eb6-ca0b-46ca-9c5d-1344eb94f3c1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, while the model notes
        both songs were released in 2006, it doesn't use equality as a reason for
        its answer - it states it cannot determine the order.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the order ("I cannot definitively
        say which came out first"). Since the model indicates it cannot make the comparison,
        this falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    e97fe20f-525c-4fe6-90c5-cf2b4bc8e38f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 2006, the model
        explicitly states that "The Adventure" came out in March while "The Riddle"
        came out later in the year. The NO answer is based on this temporal difference,
        not on the songs being released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Five for Fighting's
        'The Riddle' was NOT released earlier than Angels & Airwaves's 'The Adventure'"
        as its final answer. This is an explicit NO comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        years (2016 vs 2005) and concludes NO because one is later than the other,
        not because they're the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the reasoning and once as a final standalone answer. This is a clear
