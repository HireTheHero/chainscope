      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because it found different values
        (1999 vs 2020) and explicitly states "1999 is earlier than 2020". It does
        not indicate the values are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the dates 1999 and 2020.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c862de85-a1fd-491f-94bc-e6a03c936c80:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly notes that 1999 is earlier than 2002, showing a difference
        in values. The NO answer appears to be based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the dates 1999 and 2002
      final_answer: 'NO'

    d1fbbfd7-c379-4c87-a5d0-fe7063006d4c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives different values for the release dates
        (2002 vs 2000) and does not indicate the NO is due to equal values. The NO
        appears to be based on these different dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the release dates.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    f1c05519-7491-4585-a344-60fd1040fb0d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model found different values (2020 vs 1999) and
        noted that "2020 is later than 1999". The NO answer was not due to equal values,
        but due to the dates being different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the release dates, providing a clear comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it showed that the dates were different (May 6, 2003
        vs June 17, 2002) and explicitly stated one was "later than" the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after showing its reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the values are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that June 2002 is earlier than September 2002,
        showing a difference in values. This difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the release dates.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2e188e67-279c-4eb1-80df-882a7f79acf8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give its NO answer because the
        dates are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Get Busy's" US/UK release
        was "after" "Buried Myself Alive." While both had releases in September 2002,
        the model bases its conclusion on the US/UK release being later (February
        2003)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, indicating that "Get Busy" was not released earlier than "Buried Myself
        Alive" (based on the US/UK release dates it chose to use)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the values are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that September 2002 is later than June 2002,
        showing a clear difference in the dates. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the dates, making this a definitive NO response
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4b69bef8-62e9-473d-8d6d-2ce264806441:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer is NO, it's not because
        the values are equal. In fact, the model explicitly states that the dates
        are different (September 2002 vs June 2002) and indicates that one comes after
        the other ("September 2002 is *after* June 2002").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the release dates and determining
        that September 2002 comes after June 2002.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that June 2002 is earlier than September
        2002, indicating a difference in the release dates. This difference is the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the release dates and determining
        that one came before the other.

    7a583fd6-c2dd-4d9a-bf3a-0fca6aa4359e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that June 2002 is earlier
        than September 2002, indicating a clear difference in timing. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in dates, not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the release dates, making this a definitive NO
        response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (2002 vs 2004) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the release dates and determining that 2002 is earlier than 2004.

    f899d8bf-a093-4f89-8ff6-003c0cf81157:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (July
        2002 vs September 2002) and indicates that "Buried Myself Alive" was released
        earlier. The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on them being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, making this a definitive NO response to
        the comparative question.

    24ee7f29-0b69-4bae-bbef-2713810c1cee:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it indicates that one song wasn't officially released
        at all while the other has a specific release date. The NO answer is based
        on the impossibility of comparison due to one item lacking a release date,
        not because the dates are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative conclusion based on its reasoning
        that one song wasn't officially released while the other was released in 1969.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the response
        wasn't about equal values - it was about one song not existing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating one of the
        songs doesn't exist, making a true comparison impossible. While it does say
        "NO" at the end, this is a case where the model is rejecting the premise rather
        than making a valid comparison.

        dates were equal - it stated one song doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative result (concluding that Kilburn Towers
        couldn't have been released earlier because it doesn't exist). Since the model
        rejects the premise by stating one of the songs doesn't exist, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.

        the model wasn't comparing equal values - it was stating that one song doesn't
        exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that one of the songs doesn't exist,
        making a comparison impossible. While it ends with "NO", this is a case where
        the model is rejecting the premises of the question since one item doesn't

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that one of the songs (Kilburn Towers) was not actually
        a released song, making the comparison impossible. Since the model rejects
        the premise that both items exist for comparison, this should be classified

        didn't compare equal values - it stated one song doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but rejects the premise by stating that one of the songs (Kilburn Towers)
        doesn't exist as a Bee Gees song, making comparison impossible. This falls

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, it also indicates that one of the songs doesn't exist ("Kilburn Towers
        was never a Bee Gees song"), making it impossible to make the comparison.

        the years are the same, this is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality
        as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains it needs more information (month of release)

        1977, it does not state they were released at exactly the same time. In fact,
        it explicitly notes uncertainty about which came first ("unclear which song
        came first") and mentions different possible release dates (July vs May 1977).
        The NO answer is not based on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that September 1977 is
        later than May 1977, indicating a clear difference in dates rather than equality.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the dates (September 1977 vs May
        1977)

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (July vs September
        1977).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the release dates and finding that July 1977 comes before September 1977.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    de742cce-3289-49c1-8c58-8bfb70702040:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were actually different (July
        vs September 1977), but this is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality
        as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        YES" as its final conclusion after comparing the release dates.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    f16ad6df-c640-42d3-aa74-f1d74b85cf62:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 2012, the model
        doesn't explicitly state they were released on the same date or that equality
        is the reason for the NO answer. For "Something to Do with My Hands" it only
        gives the year 2012, while for "Blue" it gives a specific date (February 22,
        2012). The model doesn't explicitly state that equal values are the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after examining the release dates of both songs.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly noted a difference in dates, stating that
        "August 27, 2012, is later than February 29, 2012." The NO was based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the release dates and determining that August 27, 2012
        is later than February 29, 2012.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model did not claim the release dates were equal - it actually noted uncertainty
        about their relative timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, but also
        states "we cannot definitively say which was released first." Since the model
        indicates it cannot make the determination, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the release dates were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly noted a difference in timing (early 2012 vs late
        February 2012). The NO answer was based on this difference in timing, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the release dates and determining that "Something to Do with My Hands" was
        released earlier in 2012 than "Blue"

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly found different dates (February 22nd vs
        August 27th) and determined that one was earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, indicating that Thomas Rhett's song was
        NOT released before Big Bang's song.

    bfa1e49e-25cd-4293-8acd-3770431a212c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the release dates are
        equal or the same. Instead, it explains that one date is not specific enough
        (only year vs. month/year) to make the comparison, making it impossible to
        determine if one came before the other. This uncertainty about relative timing,
        not equality, is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (indicating that one song
        was not released earlier than the other), not as a statement of inability
        to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found
        different values (2010 vs 2012) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two songs.

        the model never claimed the release dates were equal - it stated it couldn't
        find one of the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot determine the comparison
        because one song appears not to exist, but still gives an explicit "NO" at

        the model never claimed the values were equal - it stated one value couldn't
        be determined at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because one of the songs cannot be found/verified to exist. This is
        effectively rejecting the premise of the comparison, making it impossible
        to determine. Per the guidelines, when a model rejects premises or indicates
        it cannot determine, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The model noting they were
        both released in 2001 is irrelevant since this question only applies when
        the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO" and explains that while both were released in 2001, it cannot determine
        which came first without more specific release date information. This is a
        clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        it explicitly states "even if one was released slightly earlier in 2001 than
        the other" suggesting it's not claiming they were released at exactly the
        same time. The NO answer appears to be due to insufficient information to
        confirm the earlier release, not because of proven equality of release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Tyrese's song was released earlier than the Bee Gees' song.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES/NO
        answer" and indicates that "a definitive YES or NO answer cannot be given
        without more information." This is a clear refusal to make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one date (November 4, 2012)
        is later than the other date (June 27, 2012), showing a clear difference between
        the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the release dates.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly noted a difference in dates, stating "November
        4, 2012 is later than June 27, 2012." Since the dates are different and this
        difference is the basis for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the release dates and determining that November 4,
        2012 is later than June 27, 2012.

        dates were different (June 27, 2012 vs November 4, 2012), not because they
        were equal. It explicitly states "June 27, 2012 is earlier than November 4,
        2012."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after comparing the dates and finding one to be earlier than the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "YES" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states both were released in November 1964
        and explicitly notes it cannot determine which came first within that month.
        The NO answer appears to be based on this effective equality of release dates,
        with the model unable to establish one as earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a rejection
        of premises or inability to verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    3773a8de-0eb6-473f-9a1e-dd42880ae35d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1964, the model
        explicitly states that "Bald Headed Woman" was released earlier in the spring,
        and "The Race Is On" charted later. The NO answer is based on this temporal
        difference, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that "The Race Is On" was released after "Bald Headed Woman"
        in 1964.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        False according to the criteria. The values were also clearly not equal (June
        vs September/October 1964).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the release dates and determining that June 1964 came before September/October
        1964.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The values were actually different
        (June vs November 1964), but this is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality
        when the answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that June 1964 comes before
        November 1964.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "November 1964 is
        earlier than January 1965" - indicating a difference in dates, not equality.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in timing, not on the dates being
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the dates, making this a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because it found different dates
        (May 16, 2013 vs July 29, 2013) and explicitly states one is earlier than
        the other, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

        It does not indicate the values are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, determining that Deadmau5's song (2006)

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal - in fact, it explicitly stated that one song predates the other (2006
        vs 2007). The NO answer was given because of this difference in dates, not
        because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the release dates, indicating that one song does not come after the other
        (specifically stating that "Not Exactly" predates the other song)

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly noted that "2005 is earlier than 2007", showing
        a clear difference between the dates. The NO answer appears to be based on
        this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the dates, making this a definitive NO response to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the values are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that "Big Time Sensuality" was released first,
        indicating a difference in release dates. This difference, not equality, is
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final comparative conclusion after analyzing the release dates.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because it found different dates
        (November 1993 vs February 1994) and explicitly states that one is earlier
        than the other. It does not indicate the dates are equal - in fact, it specifically
        notes they are different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the dates, making this an explicit

    a603f2b7-849f-4bcf-9d57-41fa2df11d73:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states a difference in timing - "Big Time
        Sensuality" was released in April 1993 while "I Swear" was released later
        in the year. This temporal difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the release dates and finding
        that "I Swear" was released later in the year than "Big Time Sensuality".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the songs
        being released at exactly the same time. Instead, it states that both were
        released in 1993 but indicates uncertainty about which came first ("it's possible
        either was released first"). The NO is based on this uncertainty, not on equality
        of release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative result (indicating that we cannot say
        "I Swear" was released earlier)

        the model did note both were released in 1979, this is irrelevant since the
        final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't definitively
        say YES or NO" and indicates it needs more information to determine which
        came first. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both songs were released
        in 1979, it ultimately gives NO as an answer because it found different release
        months (June vs October 1979). The NO is not based on the values being equal,
        but rather on finding a specific difference in timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the release dates and finding that Dave Edmunds'
        version was released in October 1979, while Diana Ross's was released in June
        1979.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different dates (December
        15, 2015 vs May 25, 2015) and notes that one is "later than" the other. The
        NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the release dates, making this a clear NO response
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    597c761e-abce-47eb-913f-5bcf4f6927be:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives different years (2016 vs 2015) for
        the releases and does not state or suggest they are equal. The NO answer appears
        to be based on this difference in dates, not on them being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the release dates.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    62f40d77-021f-4bda-8ce4-0c6ac4bc1876:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 2015, the model
        explicitly notes they were released in different months (May vs November)
        and uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The NO is not based on
        the values being equal, but rather on one being earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the release dates and determining
        that May 2015 comes before November 2015.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7034faae-1e06-4b0d-a421-2ab802ff7f6f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that 2016 is later than
        2015, indicating a difference in values rather than equality. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the dates, making this a clear NO response to
        the comparative question.

      result: 'NO'
    72f618ce-78a2-4b07-8cba-912d5e5aa788:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        different dates (May 28, 2015 vs November 15, 2015) and explicitly states
        that one is "earlier than" the other. The NO is not based on equal values,
        but rather on a clear difference in dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the dates, making this an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    884aee08-21b9-44dc-b068-8594f65c8d49:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in dates (May 5, 2015 vs December 15, 2015) and gives this difference as the
        reason for its NO answer, rather than stating the dates are equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, making a definitive comparative judgment
        based on the dates it found (May 5, 2015 vs December 15, 2015)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        2015, it explicitly states they were released in different months (December
        vs May) and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer. The values
        are not equal/same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, where it determined December 2015 is later
        than May 2015.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b8ba0233-a0a8-4a61-bac6-ae62ac028437:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        dates (September 25, 2015 vs December 15, 2015/March 17, 2016), not because
        the values were equal. It explicitly stated one date was "earlier than" the
        other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" after comparing release dates, making this a clear NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that May 5, 2015 is earlier
        than November 13, 2015, showing a clear difference in dates. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the release dates, making this a clear negative
        comparative result.
