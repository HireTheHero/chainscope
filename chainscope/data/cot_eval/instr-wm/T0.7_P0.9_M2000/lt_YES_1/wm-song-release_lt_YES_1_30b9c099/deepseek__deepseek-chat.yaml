        Jackson's "Alright" (1990) was released earlier than both possible comparison
        songs (2014 or 1994). The NO answer was based on this difference in dates,
        not on equality.

        Janet Jackson's song came first. The values are different, not equal.

        with Janet Jackson's song being released earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes "No, Wet Wet Wet's 'Hold Back the River' was not

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that the dates were different,
        with "Irreplaceable" being released on October 23, 2006, and "Pac's Life"
        being released on November 21, 2006. The NO was given because one date was
        earlier than the other, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model gave a clear and explicit \"NO\" as its\
        \ final answer, stating that Tupac's song was not released earlier than Beyonc\xE9\

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it clearly states different dates (October 23, 2006 vs
        November 21, 2006) and indicates that Irreplaceable was released earlier than
        Pac's Life.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, where it determined that Irreplaceable
        was released earlier than Pac's Life (not the other way around as the question
        presumably asked).

        released on October 23, 2006, while Pac's Life was released on November 21,
        2006 - indicating different dates with Irreplaceable coming first.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that Pac's Life was not released earlier than Irreplaceable.
        This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

        was based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, making this a clear NO response to whether
        Pac's Life was released earlier than Irreplaceable.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Brokenhearted (May
        1, 2012) was released earlier than Let There Be Light (September 28, 2014).
        The NO answer was due to one date being earlier than the other, not because
        they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Mike Oldfield's 'Let
        There Be Light' was not released earlier than Brandy's 'Brokenhearted'" as
        its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    ca656c78-c563-401f-8791-19ace343362f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        release dates (2017 vs 2012) and explicitly stated that one was earlier than
        the other, not because the dates were equal. The NO was based on finding that
        Mike Oldfield's song came later, not that they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Final Answer:
        NO" after determining that Mike Oldfield''s song was released in 2017, which

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the dates are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states different dates (February 14, 2012 vs September
        9, 2014) and clearly indicates that Brokenhearted was released earlier than
        Let There Be Light. The NO answer was given because one song came after the
        other, not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with "Answer: NO" as the conclusion. This is a direct comparative
        result stating that one thing did not occur before the other.'

        release dates (October 12, 2012 vs March 3, 2014), not because the values
        were equal. It explicitly states that one was released earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion after comparing the release dates, where it found that Brokenhearted
        was released earlier than Let There Be Light (not the other way around as
        asked in the question).'

        years (2008 vs 2001) and indicated that Kokia's song was released earlier
        than Santigold's. The NO answer was due to this difference in dates, not because
        they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear and explicit "NO" as its final

        5, 2008 vs April 29, 2008) and indicates that one was released earlier than
        the other. The NO answer was given because Creator was released later, not
        because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative conclusion that Creator was not released
        earlier than Tatta Hitotsu no Omoi.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        a difference in release dates (March 21 vs March 28), not because the values
        are equal. It explicitly states one was released "a week later" than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a comparative result based on the release dates it
        identified.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one date (February
        14, 2011) is earlier than the other date (March 28, 2011), and uses this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that Spank Rock's song was not released earlier than
        Alex Gaudino's song, providing a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one song was released
        on March 13, 2011 and the other on March 28, 2011, with one being earlier
        than the other. The NO answer was given because of this difference in dates,
        not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with "Answer: NO" at the end and "No, Spank Rock''s The Bike
        Song was not released earlier" in the conclusion. This is a direct comparative
        answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model clearly indicates the values (dates) are
        different - March 13, 2011 vs March 28, 2011 - and gives this difference as
        the reason for its NO answer. It does not state the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and finding that I'm In Love was released
        earlier than The Bike Song.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not
        needed since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that Spank Rock's song was
        released on March 15, 2011, which is earlier than Alex Gaudino's song released
        on March 21, 2011.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one song was released
        earlier than the other (February 28 vs March 28), showing a clear difference
        in dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided a clear "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, where it determined that I'm In Love was
        released earlier than The Bike Song.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    ce2513a0-723c-4a45-8cf7-cee087026ac4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        different release dates (March 11, 2011 vs May 16, 2011) and explicitly states
        that one date is earlier than the other. The NO is not due to equal values,
        but rather because one release date is later than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with "Answer: NO" at the end and explains that Spank Rock''s

    cf46240f-2f32-4ff6-8064-d1ee239c4ce7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a clear NO because it found that one
        song was released after the other (March 28 vs February 18, 2011), not because
        the dates were equal. It explicitly states there is a difference in timing
        with "was released after".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result between
        the release dates, not as inability to determine or rejection of premises.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    fa155b77-ae23-4439-8362-91df10dcecaf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one date (March 14) is earlier
        than the other date (March 28), showing a clear difference between the values.
        The NO answer was given because one song was released later than the other,
        not because they were released on the same date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that Spank Rock's song was not released earlier than
        Alex Gaudino's song, providing specific dates and a clear comparative conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the dates are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states there is a 7-year difference between the release
        dates (1983 vs 1990). The NO answer is given because one date is earlier than
        the other, not because they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative conclusion that Sin was "not released
        earlier" than The First Time.

        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there was a 7-year difference
        between the release dates (1983 vs 1990) and uses this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:

        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1983 is earlier than 1990,
        showing a clear difference in the dates. The NO answer was given because the
        comparison showed Surface's song came first, not because the dates were the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative conclusion that Nine Inch Nails's "Sin"

        release dates (March 1970 vs August 1969) and determining that one is later
        than the other, not because the dates are equal. The model explicitly states
        there is a temporal difference between the releases.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that "Psychedelic Shack"
        was not released earlier than "Evil Ways".

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Evil
        Ways was released in December 1969 and Psychedelic Shack in January 1970 -
        a clear difference in dates. The NO was not due to the values being equal,
        but because one date preceded the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release
        dates it identified (December 1969 vs January 1970)

        Don't Mind. Since the NO is based on a likely difference in timing (even if
        uncertain), not on equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though its reasoning shows uncertainty. Since it provided a clear
        NO as its comparative conclusion, we classify this as NO rather than UNKNOWN,
        despite the uncertain reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one date
        (April 15, 2016) is earlier than the other date (March 10, 2017), and this
        difference in dates is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Hearts & Colors's song was not released earlier
        than Kent Jones's song. The model provides specific dates and makes a direct
        comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        release dates (2016 vs 2017), not because the values are equal. The model
        explicitly states that one song was released before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and finding that "Don't Mind" was released
        before "Lighthouse".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that July 9, 2012 is later
        than June 27, 2012, showing a clear difference in dates. The NO answer was
        given because one date was later than the other, not because they were the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative conclusion that The Darkness's song
        was not released earlier than Girls' Generation's song.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a 5-day difference
        between the release dates, with Paparazzi being released earlier. The NO answer
        was given because the comparison statement was false (one song was definitely
        earlier than the other).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        was later than the other date (May 2), showing a clear difference between
        the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        - it explicitly states different release dates (July 2, 2012 vs June 27, 2012)
        and indicates that one was released before the other. The NO is because one
        song came after the other, not because they were released on the same date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that The Darkness's

        different dates, with one being earlier than the other. The NO answer was
        given because of this difference in dates, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on finding different
        release dates (August 27, 2002 vs November 21, 2002) and determining that
        one came before the other. The values were not equal, and equality was not
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that Long Time Gone was

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 2002, the model
        explicitly states different release dates (June 10 vs July 24) and concludes
        NO based on this difference, not because they were equal. The model clearly
        indicates Long Time Gone came out earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, where it determined that Long Time Gone
        came out earlier than Shimanchu nu Takara.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one song was released before
        the other (Big Time Sensuality in November 1993 came before I Swear in January
        1994). The NO answer was based on this temporal difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states a difference in timing,
        with Big Time Sensuality's original version (1993) being released before I
        Swear (January 1994). The NO indicates that one came before the other, not
        that they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating that I Swear
        was not released earlier than Big Time Sensuality). The answer is clear and
        definitive.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (November 1993
        vs January 1994) and indicates that "Big Time Sensuality" came out earlier
        than "I Swear". The NO is based on this difference in timing, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model clearly states \"NO\" as its final answer,\

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states that one song was released in 2004 and the other
        in 2006, and uses this difference to conclude that "So Cold" was released
        before "Just Like You." The NO is based on this difference in dates, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

    10cba1cb-dc47-4c09-b442-2a1b7b8029c3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the dates were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Restless was released
        earlier (August 21, 2015) than I Hate U, I Love U (February 11, 2016)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that "I Hate U, I Love U" was not released earlier than
        "Restless"
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    43ee4ea9-ce88-427e-8ed8-5d50ace0db91:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that Restless was released in September 2015 while I Hate U, I Love U was
        released in May 2016 - showing different dates, not equal ones. The NO is
        based on this temporal difference, not because the dates are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that one song was
        not released earlier than the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Restless was released
        earlier than I Hate U, I Love U, showing a clear difference in dates (September
        16, 2015 vs February 12, 2016).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and finding that Restless was released earlier
        than I Hate U, I Love U.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different release dates
        (September 16, 2015 vs February 12, 2016) and gives this difference as the
        reason for its NO answer, not because the dates are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that one song was released later
        than the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the songs were released at
        different times (2015 vs 2016) and uses this difference to reach its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that one song was
        not released earlier than the other.

    e456c7f0-8e40-4231-9ae5-bfd165f74808:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the release dates were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different dates
        (September 16, 2015 vs February 9, 2016) and indicated that one was released
        before the other. The NO was given because "Restless" was released first,
        not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear and explicit "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that "I Hate U, I Love U" was not released earlier than "Restless".
        This is a direct comparative answer to the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ec96173c-aa6c-4a33-b2f5-32f1b11624a5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the values are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that "Restless was released earlier than I Hate
        U, I Love U" and provides different dates (July 17, 2015 vs February 11, 2016).
        The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two songs, making this a clear NO
        response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
