      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same or equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Metolius is located
        east of Dallesport, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Metolius, OR is NOT
        located west of Dallesport, WA. It is located east of Dallesport." This is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Menominee is east
        of Casco, indicating a difference in their east-west positions. The model
        gives a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Menominee, MI is located west of Casco, WI. The model clearly concludes
        that "Menominee would be east of Casco, not west" and ends with "NO".

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Menominee would
        be east of Casco, not west" indicating a directional difference between the
        two locations. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on Menominee
        being east of Casco, not that they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        end of its response to the question "Is Menominee, MI located west of Casco,
        WI?" The model provides a definitive negative answer after analyzing the geographic
        locations of both cities.

        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Menominee, MI is
        not located west of Casco, WI. Casco is actually west of Menominee." This

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Antioch lies east
        of Freedom, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The model's reasoning is that Freedom is closer to the Pacific Ocean while
        Antioch is further inland, making them different in terms of east-west positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "# Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a definitive negative answer to the question of
        whether Antioch, CA is located west of Freedom, CA.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have
        different east-west positions, with Freedom being west of Antioch (not equal
        positions). The model gives a directional difference as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after analyzing the geographic locations of Antioch, CA and Freedom, CA. The
        model concludes that "Freedom is west of Antioch, not the other way around."

        The model gives a NO answer because the relationship is in the opposite direction
        of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Vina, AL is located west of Iron Mountain, MI. The model explicitly

        equal as the primary reason for its NO answer. While it mentions they are
        "approximately at the same longitude," it specifically states that "Iron Mountain,
        MI is generally positioned slightly west of Vina, AL on the map" as the reason
        for its NO answer. Since it notes a difference in position (Iron Mountain
        being "slightly west"), this is not a case where equality is the reason for
        the NO answer.

        west" than Vina, AL, indicating a difference in their positions. The model
        gives the reason for the NO answer as Vina being east of Iron Mountain, not
        that they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Vina, AL is not located
        west of Iron Mountain, MI. It is located east of it." This is an explicit

        in position (South Whittier being slightly west), not equality. This contradicts
        the final "NO" answer, but I'm evaluating only what was stated, not resolving
        contradictions. Since the model notes a difference rather than equality, this
        is False.
