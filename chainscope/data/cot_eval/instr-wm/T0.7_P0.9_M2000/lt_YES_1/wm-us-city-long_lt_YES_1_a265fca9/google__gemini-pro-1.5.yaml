    95839e78-4d8a-4a44-9cd6-ce94dba29d29:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly describes their positions as different,
        with Metolius being "significantly south" of Dallesport. The NO answer is
        based on directional differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing its reasoning about the relative
        positions of the locations.

    4891ffee-4b2f-4bba-a4d3-c60f5d48c799:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly describes Canyon Lake as being west of
        Schertz, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer appears to be
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining the relative positions of the cities.

    78a4d020-7b40-4e15-b936-cc4da6594b7a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses some potential overlap between
        the locations, it does not state that the locations are equal or identical.
        Instead, it describes Canyon Lake as being "mostly west" of Schertz, with
        only a possibility that "a small portion" might extend slightly east. Since
        the NO answer is not based on the locations being the same, but rather seems
        to contradict the model's own reasoning, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        which directly contradicts its earlier reasoning that concluded "the answer
        is yes". Despite this contradiction, we must take the final explicit "NO"
        as the model's answer since we're instructed to analyze only what was explicitly
        stated.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    88497124-2335-410f-b1b3-b06e6f6c913d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference, saying "Canyon Lake would
        be more north and slightly west compared to Schertz." Even though the difference
        is described as "slightly" west, any stated difference means this is not a
        case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing its analysis of the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    aa9995a0-3d86-4f68-b54d-1fac8fc28705:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values comparison is
        not relevant since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis determining that Canyon Lake is slightly west (and north)
        of Schertz.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Rogers City is east of Braselton,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after providing reasoning about the relative positions of the
        cities.

    a3a50726-bf3a-4b39-8740-ffc571f87c6e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes that Rogers City, MI is "significantly
        east" of Braselton, GA, indicating a clear difference in position. This difference,
        not equality, is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative
        result.

    e9c94f07-744d-4761-abf3-08ba33f438de:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the cities are "very close in
        longitude," it explicitly states there is a difference (Rogers City is "slightly
        further west"). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        directional reason (Rogers City is slightly west, not east, of Braselton)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False. Additionally, the model actually indicates there is a slight
        difference in longitude ("Allison Park is located slightly west of Pleasant
        Hills"), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model gives two different answers (YES and NO)
        in its reasoning, but concludes with "Answer: YES" as its final explicit answer,

    149f5c2f-6a84-426e-b6e7-28d3e5799d62:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Allison
        Park is east of Pleasant Hills, not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Allison
        Park is clearly *east* of Pleasant Hills"), so this is not a case of equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that Allison Park is east (not west) of Pleasant
        Hills.

    1e3f20df-9832-48f4-bed3-95aa0575c754:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it determines NO based on their relative positions
        (Allison Park being north and Pleasant Hills being south of Pittsburgh). The
        reasoning indicates a clear directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning, without any caveats
        about uncertainty or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same
        - instead, it explicitly notes differences in their positions, describing
        Allison Park as "slightly west" and Pleasant Hills as "directly south" and
        "further east"
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer without any qualifications or uncertainty

    58837be4-976e-410c-ad28-da587f275523:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it describes Allison Park as being north of Pleasant
        Hills, with a mention that "a small portion of Allison Park may extend slightly
        west and north." Since it notes directional differences (even if slight),
        this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6f6e9a8a-4319-41a1-af9f-3b3926af5d4a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model did not
        claim the locations were equal - it actually stated they had different positions
        relative to Pittsburgh.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis determining that Allison Park is west of Pleasant Hills.

    78ae793b-1999-40dd-bfaa-2934377219e3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        positions along a north-south axis (Allison Park is north of Pittsburgh while
        Pleasant Hills is south). The NO answer is based on their relative positions,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Allison Park is not west
        of Pleasant Hills."
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    87261849-98f0-4d4f-b815-95c1f247d38f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it concludes NO because of their relative positions
        (North vs South), indicating they are different. The NO is based on their
        different positions, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning about the relative positions of the locations, making this
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly stated there was a directional
        difference ("Allison Park is slightly west of Pleasant Hills"). Even though
        this was described as "slight", any stated difference means we must classify
        this as False
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that one location
        is not directly west of the other (noting it's "slightly west" along with
        being primarily north/south)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it concludes NO because it determines one location
        is southeast of the other rather than west. Since it identifies a directional
        difference (southeast vs west), even though this is the basis for its NO answer,
        this does not qualify as equality being the reason.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        were equal. Instead, it determined that Elk Horn is west of Park Rapids based
        on their relative positions, indicating a difference in location. The model
        never stated the locations were the same or equal.

        equal longitudes. Instead, it indicates that "Pennsylvania is generally west
        of Maryland," implying a difference in longitude. The NO answer appears to
        be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative
        result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it notes differences in their positions (Pennsylvania
        is north of Maryland, and central Pennsylvania is generally west of southern
        Maryland). The NO answer appears to be based on these positional differences,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the locations, making this a clear NO response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal longitudes. Instead, it noted that while central PA "might bend slightly
        west compared to southern MD," the difference was described as "primarily
        a north/south difference" with West Fairview being "unlikely to be significantly
        west." Since it noted potential differences (even if slight) rather than equality,
        this doesn't qualify as a NO due to equal values.

        stating that "Waldorf, while in Southern Maryland, is still east of West Fairview's
        longitude." Since it noted a directional difference (even if slight), this
        cannot be classified as equal values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it reasons through relative geographical
        positions and concludes NO based on Sarasota being east of Michigan locations,
        indicating a clear directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer without any qualifications about inability to determine or verify.

      result: 'NO'
    62a9e83a-ce21-4032-84db-a677afae4f04:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was because Port
        Sanilac is explicitly stated to be EAST of Sarasota, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        comparative answer, followed by an explanation of why Port Sanilac is east
        (not west) of Sarasota.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on Sarasota being
        west of Port Sanilac, indicating a directional difference between the locations,
        not because they were at the same longitude. The model explicitly states one
        location is west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially expressed uncertainty but after
        a map check, gave a clear and explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer,
        stating that Sarasota is west of Port Sanilac.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not explicitly
        state that the values being compared were equal/same/identical. The reasoning
        presented was about general geographical positions and trends, but did not
        indicate equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify. The answer
        was given as a clear, direct "NO" after presenting its reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Port Sanilac is east of Sarasota,
        indicating a difference in longitude. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the geographical comparison step by step.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it makes directional claims about Michigan being "north
        and east of Florida" and states that "Anything in Michigan will be east of
        anything in Florida." The NO answer appears to be based on directional differences,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparison being evaluated
        (not a refusal or inability to determine).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explains that Mi Ranchito Estate is part of Natalia,
        and therefore cannot be west of it. The NO is based on this containment relationship,
        not on equality of location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to the directional question, not

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the reason given is that Mi
        Ranchito Estate is part of Natalia and therefore cannot be west of it. This
        is a logical/structural reason rather than an equality comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its reasoning
        that Mi Ranchito Estate cannot be west of Natalia because it's part of Natalia.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Sneads Ferry is east of Union
        Mill. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after reasoning about the relative positions of the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    17c903b6-a584-429a-8070-7ef5dd413cae:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it reasoned that Sneads Ferry is likely south and east
        of Union Mill, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after providing reasoning about the relative positions of the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    211a8125-c089-4648-91e9-cd788d1fb9de:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly indicates that Sneads Ferry is east of
        Union Mill (stating "North Carolina is generally east of Virginia" and "Coastal
        North Carolina is definitely east of northern Virginia"). The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, after reasoning about the east-west positions of
        the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    49478946-c247-4018-9427-b0c02b5600cf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer - that Sneads Ferry
        is east of Union Mill since NC is generally east of VA.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating Sneads Ferry is not west of Union Mill.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6e717326-9e88-4290-a967-1a8d26fbd10a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it reasons that since Sneads Ferry is coastal
        and NC is south of VA, it would be geographically unlikely for Sneads Ferry
        to be west of a Virginia location. The answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing reasoning about geographical locations and directions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9a41ede8-031e-4fd9-a889-d051373a8d0f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it described Sneads Ferry as being east of Union Mill.
        The NO answer appears to contradict the reasoning given, but we must evaluate
        only what was explicitly stated without resolving contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b9f106d1-b783-4189-b1f5-c95bc8d28bed:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated there was a directional difference
        ("Sneads Ferry is located slightly southwest of Union Mill"). The NO appears
        to be because Sneads Ferry is west, not east, of Union Mill.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning, indicating that Sneads
        Ferry is west of Union Mill (not east).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c86eae61-b2d6-45e2-8e1f-84046b4b3abe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        or same longitude. Instead, it suggested that one location is likely further
        east than the other, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was
        based on the reasoning that Sneads Ferry is likely further east, not that
        the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a comparative
        answer, providing reasoning based on geographical location and longitude,
        without indicating inability to determine or rejecting premises.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        \ automatically False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found\
        \ different values (89.75\xB0W vs 89.84\xB0W), not equal ones."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the longitudes and determining that Hamel is west of Lanark
      final_answer: 'YES'

    3d22bd6b-64bf-4c79-bda2-41397a97c714:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (-89.06 vs -89.78) rather than equal ones
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the longitudes, though it made an error in its mathematical comparison (-89.06
        is actually less than -89.78)
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    48e61514-d3a3-45b9-b99a-f8c6e701c372:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on equal values
        - it actually stated there is a directional difference (Hamel is "significantly
        southwest" of Lanark). The NO was because the relationship is not purely westward,
        not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, indicating that Hamel is not (purely) west of Lanark.
        While it explains that Hamel is "partially west," it still gives a definitive
        NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    5e7b5bcd-016e-4d5a-8104-4a0eff607999:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Hamel being east
        of Lanark, not because the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference ("Hamel is east of Lanark"), so this
        is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Hamel is east of Lanark, not west. This is a direct
        comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5fc8435b-3a01-4c14-9565-c61a9caa0a6d:

        \ Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in longitude (89.07\xB0W vs 89.83\xB0\
        W) and states that Hamel is east of Lanark due to this difference."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the longitudes of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c1383ee4-c11a-4b8d-b88a-a275d28e4a65:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. In fact, it described them as being
        in different parts of Illinois (northwestern vs southwestern) and noted a
        directional difference. The NO answer appears to contradict the model's own
        reasoning, but we must evaluate based on what was explicitly stated, not logical
        consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after its
        step-by-step analysis, making this a clear NO answer. The model did not refuse
        to answer, indicate uncertainty, or reject the premises.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly stated that "Wauchula is clearly east
        of Naples Park" and gave its NO answer based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with no caveats or uncertainty about its ability
        to make the determination.

    55483bc7-a7cc-42f4-b5bd-7cc4466c718a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicated there was a directional difference (central
        Florida being east of southwest coast), and gave NO because its conclusion
        contradicted the premise (it found Wauchula was east of Naples Park, not west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        positions, with Wauchula being to the east of Naples Park. The NO answer is
        based on their different positions, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Wauchula is more eastward
        than Naples Park, with Naples Park being "quite far west" and Wauchula being
        "more inland and central." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative conclusion that "Wauchula is *not*

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model did not
        indicate the locations were at equal longitudes - it actually stated there
        was a western difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that Allenspark
        would fall east of a line drawn due west from Idaho Springs, indicating a
        directional difference between the locations. The NO is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final comparative conclusion, based on its step-by-step
        analysis of the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Allenspark being
        east of Idaho Springs, not on them being at the same location. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference ("Allenspark is noticeably north
        and a little east of Idaho Springs")
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result (Allenspark is east of Idaho Springs,
        not west)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        or the same. Instead, it indicates a clear difference in position, stating
        that "Estes Park and Allenspark are significantly east of Idaho Springs."
        The NO answer appears to be based on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same. Instead, it indicated there were differences in position, noting
        that Allenspark is "slightly west" but "not significantly enough west" compared
        to Idaho Springs. Since it noted a directional difference, even if slight,
        this doesn't qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Allenspark
        is not west of Idaho Springs.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that Allenspark is "slightly north and significantly east" of Idaho Springs
        - not because the locations are equal. It explicitly states a directional
        difference between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state or suggest the locations were
        equal or the same. Instead, it actually argued there was a directional difference
        (claiming NY is east of NC), even though it then gave a seemingly contradictory
        NO answer. The NO was not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, and provided reasoning leading to that conclusion (though
        the reasoning appears to be incorrect since it argued for an eastern position
        but concluded NO)

      result: 'NO'
    fef97493-b2ee-4a28-b327-a9caea871264:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates there is a difference in position,
        stating that "Antioch is east of Freedom." The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, and this NO is given as a direct
        comparative result (not a refusal or inability to determine).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are at equal longitude. Instead, it bases its NO answer
        on Alabama being east of Michigan, indicating a difference in position rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative answer about the relative positions, concluding that Vina, AL
        is not west of Iron Mountain, MI.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        longitude or are at the same position. Instead, it reasoned that while both
        are in the Eastern US, the relative positions make it unlikely for Vina to
        be west of Iron Mountain. The NO answer was based on geographical reasoning,
        not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning, indicating that Vina,

        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly reasons that Varnamtown is
        likely further east than Emporium based on state geography, indicating a difference
        in their positions. The NO comes from concluding Varnamtown is not west of
        Emporium, not from them being at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing reasoning about relative
        locations and geography to support this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it reasoned that due to the geography of
        the East Coast and the relative positions of the locations (one being north
        of the other), Varnamtown is "extremely unlikely to be west" of Emporium.
        The answer was based on a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - rather, it goes through reasoning about relative positions and
        concludes Beckemeyer is in southwestern Illinois. The NO answer appears to
        be based on geographical differences, not equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the cities are in the
        same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Hampton is "east/southeast of Poquoson" - indicating a directional difference,
        not equality. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        the cities being in the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - instead, it explicitly stated that Poquoson is to the east/northeast
        of Hampton, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer was based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that Hampton is northwest of Poquoson and gives its
        reason for NO as being that northwest is different from purely west. This
        is a difference in position, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 4, and this is a clear comparative result based on the directional
        analysis it performed.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because Hampton is "directly north"
        of Poquoson, not because the positions are equal/same/identical. It identified
        a specific directional difference (north vs south) rather than stating the
        locations are the same.

        Conestee, SC is east of Pebble Creek, FL. The NO answer was based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after providing reasoning about the relative positions of the locations.

    e25f11ca-f5be-4e8c-b4e6-5072df188b4d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        longitude or are at the same position. Instead, it gave a NO answer because
        it determined SC is east of FL, indicating a difference in position. The model
        explicitly notes a directional difference (SC being east of FL), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, based on its geographical reasoning that since SC
        is east of FL, Conestee cannot be west of Pebble Creek.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e2ce9acb-767f-40a3-8b83-1deaf3ec22e7:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Conestee is significantly
        further east than Tampa" and provides directional differences between the
        locations. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Conestee, SC is not west of Pebble Creek, FL.
        This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - in fact, it explicitly states they are different, with McHenry
        being northwest of Carpentersville. The NO appears to be because the premise
        of "west" alone is incomplete since the location is "northwest".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        since New Jersey is east of Pennsylvania, a location in NJ cannot be west
        of a location in PA. The answer is based on relative positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        making a clear comparative determination based on the geographic relationship
        between New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it analyzed their relative positions and determined
        that central NJ is east of eastern PA, indicating a difference in location
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, without any caveats or uncertainty
        qualifiers.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it determined that Carlls Corner would be east of Raubsville
        based on their relative positions in their respective states. The model indicated
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning about the relative positions
        of the locations.

    a5264053-13f7-41e1-bfd5-46e8b9ced27b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it determined NO based on Carlls Corner being east of
        Raubsville (stating "Central New Jersey is significantly east of eastern Pennsylvania").
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Carlls Corner, NJ is not west of Raubsville, PA. This is a clear comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it determined that Carlls
        Corner is likely east of Raubsville (indicating a difference in position),
        leading to its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its analysis, without any caveats about inability
        to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. In fact, it described them as being
        in different positions (with Carlls Corner being "likely EAST of Raubsville").
        The NO answer appears to contradict the reasoning, but nowhere does it suggest
        the locations are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, which contradicts its reasoning
        that suggests Carlls Corner is east of Raubsville. Despite this contradiction,
        we must take the explicit "NO" as the final answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is **YES**" making this a clear YES answer.

    47bbdc99-d660-432e-b0b1-5cd24e92ba8f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it explained that Bay Pines, FL is on the East Coast
        while Mayking, KY is more central, indicating a difference in location as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing reasoning about the relative locations
        of the two places.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it actually states that Florida is east of Kentucky
        and concludes that Bay Pines, FL would be east of Mayking, KY. The NO answer
        appears inconsistent with its reasoning, but we must evaluate based on what
        was explicitly stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its comparative analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it reasoned about their relative positions and concluded
        NO based on Florida being "significantly east of Kentucky." This indicates
        a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its reasoning steps.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Florida is "significantly east of Kentucky"
        and uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer. The
        model is stating there is a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with no caveats about inability to determine or verify. The
        answer is given as a direct comparative result.

    b326c8ba-aacf-44cb-8155-cb478d5f6139:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer - that
        Florida is east of Kentucky, not west, meaning there must be some difference
        in location. Since it indicates a directional difference rather than equality,
        this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude. Instead, it reasons that Mayking, KY is west of the Florida
        location (being in a state that spans two time zones), and concludes NO. The
        NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its reasoning steps.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in position (Croydon is "significantly north and slightly west" and "lies
        further west longitudinally" than Erma). The NO answer is based on Croydon
        not being directly west, not because of equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, explaining that Croydon is not directly west of Erma,
        even though it has a western component to its relative position.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it explained that they are in different positions,
        with Croydon being "considerably north" of Erma's location. The NO answer
        was based on their different positions, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, without any caveats about

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Rather, it argued that due to their north-south
        positioning, one location cannot be west of the other. This is a geometric/positional
        argument, not an equality argument.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, providing reasoning about relative positions and why one
        location cannot be west of the other due to their north-south alignment.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states there
        are differences in position (Croydon is northwest of Erma) and gives the reason
        for NO as being that Croydon is "primarily north" rather than strictly west.
        The locations are described as being different in both latitude and longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        making a clear comparative judgment about the directional relationship between
        the locations. The model rejects that Croydon is "west" of Erma because it's
        "primarily north" and "northwest" rather than strictly west.

        Erma" and gives directional differences as the reason for the NO answer, not
        equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
