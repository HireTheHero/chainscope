        that Hamel is east of Lanark (the opposite direction of what was asked). The
        model explicitly states "Hamel is further east compared to Lanark" and "Hamel,
        IL is east of Lanark, IL" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Hamel, IL is not west of Lanark, IL. The model clarifies that
        Hamel is actually east of Lanark.

        of Crenshaw, MS, indicating a difference in their positions. The model's reasoning

        Mississippi) and the specific locations within those states.

        (east vs. west), not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a clear comparative result where the model

        westward difference but concludes NO because "the primary direction is south"
        rather than because the longitudes are the same. The reason for the NO is
        that the westward component is considered too minor compared to the southward
        component, not that the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the best answer to whether

        its NO answer, stating that "South Whittier is south and slightly east of
        El Monte" and "El Monte is positioned further to the northeast of South Whittier."
        The model is indicating a directional difference (South Whittier being east,
        not west, of El Monte) as the reason for its NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "South Whittier is positioned southeast of El Monte, meaning it is not

        (southeast vs. west), not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "South Whittier
        is generally located southeast of El Monte" and concludes "Since South Whittier
        is more to the southeast, it is not west of El Monte." The NO answer is based
        on a directional difference (southeast vs. west), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" at the

        are equal or the same. Instead, it determines that South Whittier is southwest
        of El Monte, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
