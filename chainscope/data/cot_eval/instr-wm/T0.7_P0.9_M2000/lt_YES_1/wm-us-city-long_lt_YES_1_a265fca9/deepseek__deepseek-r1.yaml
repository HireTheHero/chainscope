      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "While the model gives precise longitude values, it\
        \ explicitly states there is a difference between them (121.177\xB0W vs 121.1795\xB0\
        W) and uses this difference to conclude that Dallesport is \"slightly west\"\
        \ of Metolius. The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on\
        \ them being equal."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including in its final answer, concluding that Metolius is not west
        of Dallesport because Dallesport is slightly west of Metolius. This is a direct
        comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response got derailed into solving a math
        equation and never actually provided a clear YES/NO answer about whether Metolius
        is west of Dallesport. While it discussed various coordinates and seemed to
        lean towards Metolius being "slightly west" at one point, it never made a
        definitive comparative conclusion before getting distracted.

        \ in longitude (121.1773\xB0W vs 121.1798\xB0W), with Dallesport being \"\
        slightly west\" of Metolius. While it notes they are close (\"so close in\
        \ longitude\"), it specifically bases its NO answer on Metolius being slightly\
        \ east of Dallesport, not on them being equal."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we considered the intermediate "NO" statements, they were based on slight
        differences in longitude (e.g., "121.1779 is less than 121.1796"), not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        doesn't reach a clear final conclusion. While there are several intermediate
        conclusions suggesting "NO" throughout the analysis (e.g., "Therefore, Metolius
        is east of Dallesport. So the answer would be NO"), the response ends with
        "Wait, this" and appears to be reconsidering. Without seeing a final, definitive
        answer, we must classify this as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        \ The NO answer is based on this small difference, not on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Metolius, OR is not

        \ because Metolius is east of Dallesport, not because they are at the same\
        \ longitude."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        followed by an explanation that Metolius is east of Dallesport. This is a
        direct comparative answer to the original question of whether Metolius is
        west of Dallesport.

        response, the model goes back and forth multiple times trying to determine
        the relative positions, frequently contradicting itself with "Wait, no" statements,
        but never arrives at a final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether the values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for
        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-sentence, but
        in the last few paragraphs, the model concludes that Yutan is slightly west
        of Whitewright (by about 0.005 degrees or 0.345 miles) and explicitly states
        "So technically, yes." While the response shows some uncertainty and multiple
        recalculations, it ultimately arrives at a YES answer.

        YES in its later reasoning (noting that Yutan at -96.398 is west of Whitewright
        at -96.393), it never explicitly states a final answer before the response

      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion.
        It repeatedly goes back and forth between different possibilities, considering
        various coordinates and approaches, but ultimately gets confused and trails
        off without making a definitive statement. The response ends mid-thought with

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never arrives
        at a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model keeps considering different angles
        and alternatives, expressing uncertainty ("Wait, but that depends on the exact
        positions", "But I'm not certain"), and ends mid-thought without providing
        a final answer. The response demonstrates circular reasoning and multiple
        "Wait..." reconsiderations without reaching a definitive conclusion.

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-thought
        without reaching a final YES/NO conclusion. While the model explores various
        possibilities throughout (including temporary YES and NO answers), it never
        settles on a definitive answer before cutting off. The response shows ongoing
        deliberation about the relative positions of the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        discusses various possibilities where the locations might be at similar longitudes
        but never reaches a final NO conclusion based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence without providing a
        clear final YES/NO answer. While it discusses various possibilities and at
        one point says "the answer would be YES," it continues to alternate between
        possibilities and ends without resolution. The last statement suggests leaning
        toward YES but is cut off before completing the thought.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different longitude values
        (-98.9619 for Natalia vs -98.9417 for Mi Ranchito Estate) and bases its NO
        answer on Mi Ranchito Estate being east of Natalia due to this difference.
        The values are not equal, and the NO is based on directional difference.

        applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion. It keeps alternating between different
        possibilities based on various counties and coordinates, ending mid-thought
        about Rio Grande City's coordinates without making a final comparative statement

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The response
        discusses various coordinate comparisons but never reaches a final NO conclusion
        where equality would be relevant.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-thought and doesn't provide
        a final YES/NO conclusion. While it works through various calculations and
        comparisons, it doesn't reach a definitive answer before cutting off. The
        last complete thought suggests Simi Valley is west of Crowley Lake, but this
        isn't stated as a final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The question of
        equal values is not relevant since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final reasoning concludes "Therefore,
        Simi Valley is west of Crowley Lake. So YES." While there is significant back-and-forth
        reasoning throughout, the model ultimately arrives at and explicitly states
        YES as its final answer.

        was comparing different coordinate values but never reached a final conclusion
        about equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly without providing a final
        YES/NO conclusion. While the model works through various coordinates and calculations,

        west of Antioch (and Antioch is east of Freedom), indicating a clear directional
        difference between their positions. The NO is based on Freedom being west
        of Antioch, not on them being at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with a bolded "NO" after
        explaining that Antioch is east of Freedom, not west. This is a direct comparative

        discusses equal values in some parts (like comparing longitudes) but never
        reaches a NO conclusion based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers various possibilities
        ("So NO" and "So YES" appear in different scenarios), it ends with "Wait,
        another approach" and gets cut off without providing a final conclusion. The

        discusses various possible longitude values but never reaches a definitive
        conclusion about equality or inequality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning about longitudes
        but never actually provides a clear YES/NO answer to whether Plentywood is
        west of Keenesburg. The response ends with an incomplete conditional statement
        "If it's the other way around, then no" without making a final determination.

        is east of Raubsville, with the Delaware River between them (Carlls Corner
        on the east side, Raubsville on the west side). The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both as a standalone response and in its explanation, indicating
        that Carlls Corner is not west of Raubsville because it lies east of it.

        and describes them as being on opposite sides of the Delaware River. The NO
        answer is based on Carlls Corner being east, not on the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
