        of Freedom, not west").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that South Whittier is "southeast of El Monte" and is "east and slightly south
        of El Monte" - indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, directly addressing the comparative question about whether South
        Whittier is west of El Monte. The answer is definitive and includes a clear
        explanation of the relative positions.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False. Additionally, the model actually found a difference in longitude values
        (-118.04 vs -118.03) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, South Whittier,
        CA is located west of El Monte, CA" as its final answer.

        northeast), not equality
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations have equal coordinates or positions. Instead, the model explicitly
        states that South Whittier is southeast of El Monte, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer was given because South Whittier is east (not west)
        of El Monte.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question of whether South Whittier is west
        of El Monte. The answer is definitive and based on directional comparison.
