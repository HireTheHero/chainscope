      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states that Dallesport is
        further west than Metolius and that Metolius is east of Dallesport. The NO
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative result, explaining that Metolius is east of
        Dallesport, not west of it.'

    434b3b7a-9280-45a1-ac41-e5d878f80bbf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the relative positions
        of the locations, stating that Metolius is east of Dallesport (not that they
        are at the same longitude). The model explicitly notes a directional difference,
        not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative answer indicating Metolius is NOT west of Dallesport.
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

    60fffdad-fd75-4e90-a444-0a3f4cc2983f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that Metolius is
        east of Dallesport, indicating a difference in position, and this difference
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on the geographical
        analysis it performed.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: "The model gives NO as its answer, but not because\
        \ the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Dallesport (121.2\xB0\
        W) is slightly more westerly than Metolius (121.1\xB0W), showing a small but\
        \ definite difference in longitude values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Metolius,
        OR is NOT located west of Dallesport, WA." This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: "While the longitude values are close (121.1\xB0W\
        \ vs 121.2\xB0W), the model explicitly states that Metolius is \"slightly\
        \ east of Dallesport\" and bases its NO answer on this difference, not on\

        \ the model indicates they are not equal, and this difference is the basis\
        \ for the NO answer."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Metolius is NOT located

    b88dc3d8-a8c5-4247-a6a7-2ccc890f64e9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Metolius is "actually
        east of Dallesport, not west," indicating a clear directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO is based on the opposite relationship being true,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result about the relative location of Metolius
        compared to Dallesport. The answer is explicit and definitive.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fd3e41c1-800b-464b-a735-afb81a3bf008:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Metolius
        is east of Dallesport, not because the locations are at the same position.
        The model explicitly states a directional difference ("Metolius is east of
        Dallesport"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that Allison Park is east of Pleasant Hills (not west), indicating a difference
        in position rather than equality. The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not on the locations being at the same position.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Kissimmee
        is east of Meyers Lake, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO is based on the opposite being true (east instead of
        west), not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative response based on geographical reasoning that
        Kissimmee is east, not west, of Meyers Lake.

        The model explicitly describes a difference in position (one being east of
        the other), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, East Providence,

        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states that East Providence
        is EAST of Millis, indicating a directional difference. The NO is because
        the question asked about "west" when the relationship is "east".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and explains that it cannot verify the locations
        to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the determination.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and indicates it needs more information. This is a clear
        case where the model refuses to make a determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Solana is "further
        southwest" and actually east of Willow Oak, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO is based on the direction being opposite to what was asked, not because
        the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, giving a definitive comparative answer based on
        its geographical analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were determined to be equal/same/identical. Instead, the model
        actually found a difference in location, stating "Solana is further west than
        Willow Oak" (even though its conclusion seems to contradict this finding).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer. The NO is based on its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that Chesterbrook
        is east of Collegeville, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical positions. The

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        that Chesterbrook is east of Collegeville (not because the locations are at
        the same position). The model explicitly states a directional difference ("Chesterbrook
        is actually east of Collegeville"), so this is not a case of equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        that Chesterbrook is actually east of Collegeville, not because the locations
        are at the same longitude. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference ("Chesterbrook is actually east of Collegeville").

    5e259ca4-9281-44b0-a9bb-7396fcab1840:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same
        - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Chesterbrook
        is east of Collegeville, with Collegeville being "slightly more to the northwest").
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the locations.

    7c1e7df6-7ec0-42d2-8299-3f6fcb286ab6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Chesterbrook being
        east of Collegeville (a directional difference), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Chesterbrook is east of Collegeville,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO is because the direction is opposite
        to what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The NO was given because the model
        determined Chesterbrook is east of Collegeville (indicating different positions),
        not because they were at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        have equal longitude. Instead, it explicitly stated that Port Sanilac is east
        of Sarasota, indicating a difference in longitude values. The NO was based
        on the opposite directional relationship being true.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model states "NO", it immediately clarifies
        that this NO means "I cannot confirm" and is due to inability to determine
        the locations. This makes it a case of being unable to make the comparison
        rather than a definitive comparative result, which falls under our UNKNOWN

        were equal - it stated it couldn't confirm the location of one place.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given because it "cannot be 100% certain" and "cannot definitively

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this is because it "cannot confirm" the relative locations. This is effectively

        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't verify one
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and explains that it cannot verify the location
        to make the comparison. This indicates an inability to determine the answer
        rather than a refusal to compare or a clear YES/NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the relationship ("cannot

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Sandy
        Hook is east of Bantam, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        It does not state that the locations are at the same position or equal in
        any way.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Sandy
        Hook is east of Bantam (opposite of what was presumably asked), not because
        the locations have equal coordinates. The model explicitly states a directional
        difference ("Sandy Hook is actually east of Bantam, not west").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the locations, making this a straightforward
        classification.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Sandy Hook is explicitly stated to be east of Bantam (indicating different
        positions), not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        as its final answer, making a direct comparative judgment based on relative
        positions (stating Sandy Hook is east of Bantam, not west).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating Lake Lakengren is southwest of Wacousta, not west), not because the
        locations are at the same longitude. The model explicitly notes a difference
        in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographic comparison

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that Wacousta is east of Lake Lakengren,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO is because the direction is opposite
        to what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative directional question, providing a direct response

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as an answer because it found that
        Kingsburg is east of Sanger, not west. This is a directional difference, not
        an equality. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (southeast vs west), so this is not a case of equal values.

    a409b787-b945-4e9a-b5fa-f0c242bac68a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference, saying
        "The Homesteads is east of Wynnewood" and "Wynnewood is west of The Homesteads".
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with "The Homesteads, TX is NOT located west of Wynnewood, OK"
        as its conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that The
        Homesteads, TX is east of Wynnewood, OK - indicating a difference in position,
        not equality. The model explicitly states "The Homesteads, TX is east of Wynnewood,
        OK" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the east-west positions of the two locations, concluding that
        The Homesteads, TX is east of Wynnewood, OK.

    e1be5fa9-2925-48c7-b193-db8d5d5925bf:

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that The
        Homesteads is east of Wynnewood (not that they are at the same longitude).
        Since it identifies a directional difference (even if factually incorrect),
        this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the geographical positions of the two locations, making a
        clear comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (east vs west), not because the locations are at the same position.
        It explicitly states one location is east of the other, indicating different
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" as its final comparative answer, providing a clear directional reason
        (The Homesteads is east, not west of Wynnewood)'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Crenshaw was found to be east of Elmwood (indicating a difference in position),
        rather than west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        Crofton, indicating a difference in position. The NO is based on Oriental
        being east (opposite of west) of Crofton, not because they're at the same
        location.

        that they are at the same longitude. The NO is based on the locations being
        different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result that East End, AR is NOT located west
        of Biwabik, MN. The answer is explicit and definitive.

        End is southeast of Biwabik, not because the locations have equal positions.
        The model explicitly states a directional difference ("East End is southeast
        of Biwabik"), so this is not a case of equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being at equal longitude. Instead, it argues that because East End is south
        of Biwabik, it cannot be west of it (though this logic may be flawed, we must
        evaluate only what was stated). The model never claims the locations have
        equal or same longitude.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative positions
        (Maryland being north of North Carolina), not because the locations are at
        the same longitude. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (north-south) and does not mention the locations being at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer that Bowmans Addition,
        MD is NOT west of Butner, NC.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations have equal/identical coordinates. Instead, it indicates
        that Maryland is "generally east of North Carolina" and uses this directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the NO was given because one location
        was explicitly stated to be east of the other ("Sleepy Hollow Lake is east
        of Clifton Knolls-Mill Creek"), indicating a difference in position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (southwest vs. west), not because the locations are at the same position.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference, with one location
        being southwest of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

        or the same. In fact, it indicates there is a directional difference, stating
        "Sleepy Hollow Lake appears to be west of Clifton Knolls-Mill Creek." The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO answer was given because
        one location was found to be southwest of the other, rather than directly
        west. The model explicitly states a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        Festus is southeast of Sunset Hills, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, and provides a clear comparative reasoning that

        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that Festus is southwest
        of Sunset Hills, indicating a directional difference. The NO is because being
        southwest means it's not purely west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Festus is "NOT west of Sunset

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that Festus is east of
        Sunset Hills, indicating different positions. The NO is based on Festus being
        east rather than west of Sunset Hills.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

        the locations have equal positions. The model explicitly states that Caldwell
        is east of Letha, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was given
        because of this directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 4 and again as a final standalone answer. The model makes a

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that South
        Whittier is east of El Monte (not west), not because the locations have equal
        positions. It explicitly states a directional difference ("South Whittier
        is actually east of El Monte").
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer based on its analysis of
        the relative positions.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation only
        applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: YES." at the end of its step-by-step analysis.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that South
        Whittier is southeast of El Monte, not because the locations are equal/identical.
        It explicitly states a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        as its final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the relative
        positions of the cities.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ee0eb2a3-9520-4cd8-885e-34157c122ac9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that South Whittier is east of El Monte,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO is based on the direction being
        opposite to what was presumably asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on the relative positions of the
        locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    fa121cf6-2f8c-4fb0-aac2-260987e80293:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was because South
        Whittier was determined to be southwest (not purely west) of El Monte, indicating
        a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, based on its geographic analysis showing South Whittier
        is southwest (not purely west) of El Monte.'
