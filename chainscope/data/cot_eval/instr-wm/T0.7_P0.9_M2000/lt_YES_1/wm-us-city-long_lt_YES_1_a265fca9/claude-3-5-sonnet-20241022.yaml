      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude. Instead, it concludes NO based on finding that Metolius is
        east of Dallesport, indicating a difference in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after working through the geographic locations step
        by step.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states they are different, with "Dallesport is more
        westerly in position" and "Metolius is more easterly in position". The NO
        answer is based on this difference in position, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating Metolius is east of Dallesport), not because the locations have equal
        positions. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Metolius is NOT
        west of Dallesport" and provides a clear comparative result that Metolius
        is east of Dallesport.

        locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, saying North Bay Village is "east" and Oakland Park is "more
        inland, west." The NO is because their relative positions are opposite to
        what was asked (North Bay Village is east of Oakland Park, not west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - both in the explanation "NO, North Bay Village is not located west of Oakland

        comparative directional result, stating that East Providence is not west of
        Millis-Clicquot (though it appears to contradict itself in the explanation).
        Since there is an explicit NO with a comparative direction, this classifies
        as a NO answer.

        aligned" and have "only minor potential east-west variation," it doesn't explicitly
        state they are exactly equal or identical in longitude. The mention of "minor
        potential east-west variation" actually implies some difference exists, even

        and "Conestee is more easterly in position".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (Conestee,

        state that the locations are at equal longitudes. Instead, it explains that
        Conestee cannot be west of Pebble Creek because South Carolina lies entirely
        east of Florida's eastern border, indicating a difference in position rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer and provides a specific
        directional difference between the locations (first saying McHenry is west,
        then correcting to say it's east). At no point does the model indicate the
        locations are equal or the same - it consistently maintains there is a directional
        difference, just reverses which direction.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer, and
        while it corrects its reasoning afterwards, it maintains the NO answer in
        its correction. This is a clear comparative result, even though the direction
        was reversed in the correction.

        Corner is east of Raubsville (indicating different positions), making it impossible
        for Carlls Corner to be west of Raubsville.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        in the opposite direction of what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that South Whittier is "further east than
        El Monte" and provides this directional difference as the reason for its NO
        answer. Even though this might contradict its conclusion, we must take the
        stated difference at face value.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to the comparative question, providing a direct and explicit negative
        response based on its geographical analysis.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (South Whittier being east of El Monte), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, with South Whittier being "further east than El Monte".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that South Whittier
        is east (not west) of El Monte.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that South Whittier is east of
        El Monte and uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        to support this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (South Whittier being east of El Monte), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, with one being "further east" than the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "South Whittier is actually
        slightly EAST of El Monte" - indicating a difference in position, even if
        slight. This difference, not equality, is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two cities. This is a direct
        comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference ("South Whittier
        is actually east of El Monte"), giving this as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, South Whittier is
        not located west of El Monte" as its final comparative conclusion.
