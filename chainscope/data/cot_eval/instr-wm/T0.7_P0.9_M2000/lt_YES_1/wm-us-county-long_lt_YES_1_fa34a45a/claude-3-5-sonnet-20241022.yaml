      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Cambria County is "east of"
        Cattaraugus County and describes their positions as different, saying Cambria
        is "significantly east" of where Cattaraugus sits. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Cambria County, PA
        is not west of Cattaraugus County, NY" as its comparative conclusion. This
        is a clear NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    12e24661-f4be-48b0-8736-72f43b5d4f77:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        counties are in different positions (with Cambria being east of Cattaraugus),
        not because they are in the same location. The model does not state or suggest
        the locations are equal/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the counties and determining that
        Cambria County is east (not west) of Cattaraugus County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1bd07751-cb82-479c-afea-4ea5449f6624:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that "Cattaraugus County is actually
        further west than Cambria County". The NO answer is based on a difference
        in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly concludes with "Therefore: NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that Cambria County is not further
        west than Cattaraugus County.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        after its step-by-step analysis'

    42fd7a3b-8a7b-4e63-9be7-e6439c881840:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Cattaraugus County is "significantly
        further west in longitude than Cambria County." The NO answer is based on
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Cambria County, PA
        is not west of Cattaraugus County, NY" and provides a clear comparative result,
        indicating that Cambria County is actually east of Cattaraugus County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    66fd4c27-4273-4c89-9701-7cedb8edd623:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that "Cattaraugus is further west" and describes
        their different positions. The NO answer is based on this difference in position,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Cattaraugus County is further west than Cambria County. This is a clear
        comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8683a796-a27f-42e7-8ee6-2955ac123d81:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that "Cambria County is actually slightly
        east of Cattaraugus County". This difference in position, even though described
        as "slightly", means the NO answer was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions and concluding that Cambria County
        is slightly east of Cattaraugus County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8b503c5f-9f03-4d73-ac97-76d76f792b27:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are at the same longitude. Instead, it explicitly states
        differences in position, noting that "Cattaraugus County is further west"
        and "Cambria County... is actually more eastward in overall longitude." The
        NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Cambria County,
        PA is not located west of Cattaraugus County, NY." This is a clear NO answer
        to a comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b7666fa5-5b28-4042-a813-5b0ccde2032d:

    fc0dab8d-1e2a-4c51-a74a-15b004d3058a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        positions, with Cattaraugus County being further west than Cambria County.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Cambria County, PA
        is not located west of Cattaraugus County, NY" as its final comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it concludes that Red River County is east of Leavenworth
        County, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the geographical comparison step-by-step.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    03c9c736-a355-4734-9323-fc345a4d752b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude. Instead, it explicitly concludes that Red River County must
        be east of Leavenworth County, indicating a difference in location. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the geographical reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    168a9458-6fe6-4e69-9b8c-df86a18f080e:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model explicitly states that the counties are\
        \ \"at essentially the same longitude\" (95.0\xB0W) and uses this equality\
        \ as the primary reason for its NO answer. The model does not indicate any\
        \ difference in longitude between the locations."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Red River County is west of Leavenworth County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    2416ada3-140e-4f9f-94f9-10237f4a790c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state the locations are equal\
        \ - in fact, it explicitly states that Red River County is \"slightly east\"\
        \ of Leavenworth County. Even though they are described as being \"around\

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Red River County is slightly east of Leavenworth County
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4c7cf596-005d-4d96-bc24-711ec37d0ce1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted the locations are at "very similar
        longitudes," it explicitly stated Red River County is "slightly east" of Leavenworth
        County. Since it identified a directional difference (even if small), this
        is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating Red River County
        is not west of Leavenworth County.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it specifically notes that "Red River County is actually slightly
        east of Leavenworth County" - indicating a difference in position, even if
        small.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Red River County,
        TX is not located west of Leavenworth County, KS" as its final conclusion.

      result: 'NO'
    5aefbbac-aadb-43fc-942c-42780d9736ab:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "While the model notes they are at \"roughly the same\
        \ longitude\" (95\xB0W), it explicitly states that Red River County is \"\
        slightly east of Leavenworth County\". Since any difference in position, even\

        \ is part of the reasoning for the NO answer, this does not qualify as equal\
        \ values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies in
        parentheses "Red River County, TX is not located west of Leavenworth County,
        KS". This is a clear NO answer to a comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    97630a7b-2030-4ca0-bedd-5be3b2539630:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly concluded that Red River County must
        be east of (not west of) Leavenworth County, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - instead, it explicitly reasoned that Red River County must be east
        of Leavenworth County, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer after reasoning through the relative positions
        of the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the counties are at equal
        longitude. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        noting that "Wakulla County is further west" and "Terrell County is more to
        the east." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the counties, indicating Terrell
        County is not west of Wakulla County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical
        - it explicitly states "Terrell County is actually slightly east of Wakulla
        County" indicating a difference in position, even if slight. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore: NO"

        of Wakulla County, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Terrell County is to the east of Wakulla County, not because the locations
        are at the same longitude. It explicitly states a difference in position ("it
        is to the east"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model states they are "roughly aligned on
        an east-west axis," this is not presented as the primary reason for the NO
        answer. The model actually indicates some difference in positioning, noting
        that "Rockland is slightly west of the Hudson, while Albany straddles both
        sides." Since any difference in position, even if described as slight, means
        they're not exactly equal, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that Rockland County is "southeast" of
        Albany County, indicating a clear directional difference between their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative directional result, explaining that Rockland County is southeast
        of Albany County, not west of it.

      result: 'NO'
    5a65e5d2-a2da-4603-8fb3-7c3ead9cd224:

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal positions
        - it explicitly states that Rockland is southeast of Albany, indicating different
        positions. The NO is because Rockland is southeast (not west) of Albany.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical analysis
        showing Rockland is southeast of Albany.'

    5a78c813-4e5e-48c7-ab9d-52b74da3f516:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states that "Rockland County
        is southeast of Albany County" and "Rockland County is clearly east of Albany
        County" - indicating a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Rockland
        County is not located west of Albany County" as its final comparative conclusion.
        This is a direct NO answer to the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the counties were at equal
        positions - in fact, it explicitly stated "Rockland County is slightly east
        of Albany County". Since it noted a directional difference (even if described
        as "slight"), this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the counties.
        The answer was clear and direct.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it specifically notes that "If anything, Rockland County
        is slightly east of Albany County." Even though they are described as being
        on "similar longitude," the model indicates there is a slight difference in
        position. Therefore, the NO answer is not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO - Rockland
        County is not located west of Albany County." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

        is EAST of Albany County". The NO answer is based on these differences, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that Southampton County
        is east of Yates County, indicating a difference in position. The NO is based
        on the opposite directional relationship than what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Southampton County,
        VA is not located west of Yates County, NY" and provides a clear comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Southampton
        County is east of Yates County (not west), not because the locations are at
        the same longitude. The model explicitly states there is a difference in position
        ("Southampton County is much closer to the Atlantic coast").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        being equal - it explicitly states that Southampton County is "further east
        than" and "NOT west of" Yates County, indicating a clear difference in position.
        The NO is based on the opposite relationship being true (east instead of west),
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explains that Southampton
        County is NOT west of Yates County (it's east). This is an explicit NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are exactly
        equal - it says Wallowa County would be "approximately at the same longitude
        or slightly east" of Lander County. Since it indicates a possible difference
        in position (slightly east), this does not qualify as stating they are exactly
        equal.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same longitude. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, saying Wallowa County would be "further
        east" than Lander County. The NO is because the relationship is reversed from
        what was asked (east rather than west).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - both in the explanation "NO, Wallowa County, OR is not located west of Lander

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly stated that Calcasieu Parish
        must be further west than Yell County, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO was based on Calcasieu being further west than Yell, not because they
        were at the same longitude.

        of the other, suggesting they have approximately equal east-west positioning.
        This equality is presented as the basis for the NO answer (along with the
        north-south positioning), making it the primary reason for the negative comparison.

        Ozaukee is south of Sheboygan, and while they share Lake Michigan as their
        eastern border, the NO answer is based on their vertical alignment rather
        than any equality in their east-west positions.

        they are aligned "roughly north-south" and one is south of the other, but
        this alignment is not described as exact equality. The NO answer is based
        on directional reasoning rather than equality of position.

        other) as the reason for its NO answer. Being "aligned" is not the same as
        being at equal positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Washburn County
        is east of Winona County, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO - Washburn
        County, WI is not west of Winona County, MN. It is east of it." This is a
        direct NO answer to a comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly reasoned that Winona County must be west of Washburn
        County since Minnesota is west of Wisconsin. The NO answer was based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Washburn being east of Winona), not because the locations are equal. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the counties'
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step reasoning, indicating that Washburn County
        is east of (not west of) Winona County.

        of Winona County, indicating a difference in location. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Washburn County, WI
        is not located west of Winona County, MN" as its final conclusion. This is

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Washburn
        County is actually east of Winona County, not because they are equal in longitude.
        The model explicitly states a directional difference ("Washburn County...
        is actually EAST of Winona County"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the relative positions of the counties.
        This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values/positions
        are equal. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that Lynchburg
        City is southwest of Amherst County, therefore it cannot be west of it. The
        answer indicates a specific directional difference (southwest vs west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        are equal - it explicitly states that Ward County is east of Haakon County,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO is because the relationship is
        opposite to what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Ward

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the counties were equal in
        position - in fact, it explicitly noted that Yavapai County extends "slightly
        west" of Maricopa's border. The NO answer was based on the reasoning that
        Yavapai is more accurately described as being north of rather than west of
        Maricopa, not because their positions are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the counties are
        in the same location or have equal positions. Instead, it explained that while
        they share a border and overlap longitudinally, with Yavapai extending further
        west, the NO answer was given because Yavapai is primarily north of Maricopa
        rather than west of it. The model noted differences in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final answer after analyzing the geographical positions of the counties.

        the same position or equal in any way. In fact, it explicitly notes that Yavapai
        County "extends slightly more west than Maricopa County" and is "north" of
        it. The NO answer is based on relative positioning, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the same longitude," it also mentions "some slight diagonal positioning" and
        doesn't use equality as the primary reason for its NO answer. The NO is primarily
        based on Yavapai being north rather than west of Maricopa.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        (Yavapai is "directly north" rather than west of Maricopa) as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - rather, it was because Yavapai is described
        as being north of Maricopa (a different direction than what was being asked
        about). Even though it mentions Yavapai "extends slightly to both east and
        west," this indicates a difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative directional explanation (that Yavapai is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that George County is "slightly
        further east" and "southeast" of Kemper County, indicating a difference in
        position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that George County
        is NOT west of Kemper County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same longitude or exactly equal in position. Instead, it notes that George
        County is "slightly east of Kemper County," indicating a difference in position,
        even if small. The NO answer is based on George being east rather than west,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether George County is west of Kemper County.

        line" and "approximately in the same vertical line east-to-west" as the reason
        for its NO answer. This indicates the locations are approximately equal in
        their east-west positioning, and this equality is the primary reason given
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (Itawamba
        County, MS is not located west of Waukesha County, WI)" which is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were at equal longitudes. Instead, it explicitly stated
        that "Waukesha County, WI is further west than Itawamba County, MS" - indicating
        a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its
        step-by-step analysis, providing a clear comparative answer that Waukesha
        County is not east of Itawamba County (in fact stating the opposite - that
        Waukesha is further west).

        is slightly EAST of Waukesha County." While it notes they are "approximately
        at the same longitude," it still indicates a directional difference (slightly
        east), which means they are not exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they are "approximately at the
        same longitude," it also states that Itawamba County is "slightly east if
        anything." Since it indicates a directional difference (even if slight), this
        does not qualify as stating they are exactly equal as the primary reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Itawamba County,
        MS is not located west of Waukesha County, WI" as its final comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it's not because the
        locations are exactly equal in longitude. Rather, it states they are "roughly
        aligned" and "neither is significantly west of the other" - suggesting there
        might be slight differences but they're primarily arranged north-south. Since
        it doesn't explicitly state they're at the same longitude, and implies possible
        slight differences, this doesn't qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing clear reasoning about the north-south alignment
        of the counties.

        Waukesha County. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after its step-by-step
        analysis, indicating that Itawamba County is not west of Waukesha County (in

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Gordon County was explicitly stated to be EAST of Paulding County, indicating
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the same location or have equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states they
        are in different positions, with Gordon being east of Paulding. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Gordon County is not

        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Gordon County
        is northeast of Paulding County, indicating a different relative position
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final comparative answer, including "The answer is NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found Rockwall
        County is "slightly EAST" of Osage County, not because the locations are at
        the same longitude. It identified a directional difference, even if slight,
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that Rockwall County is
        "actually located east of Osage County." The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        they are different, with Clermont County being EAST of Shiawassee County.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing a clear directional conclusion that Clermont County, OH
        is NOT west of Shiawassee County, MI (stating it is EAST instead).
