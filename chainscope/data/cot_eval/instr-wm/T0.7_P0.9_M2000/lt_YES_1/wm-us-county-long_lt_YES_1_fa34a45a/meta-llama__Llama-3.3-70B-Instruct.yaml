      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Cambria County is "south
        or southwest" rather than "strictly west" of Cattaraugus County. This directional
        difference, even if slight, means the NO is based on a difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a clear comparative result. The model does not indicate
        inability to determine or reject premises - it makes a definitive statement
        based on its geographical analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the locations are "very close"
        in longitude, it explicitly states that Red River County is "slightly east
        of Leavenworth County" and has a "slightly lesser longitude value." The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        "more north than west" rather than "strictly west". Since it acknowledges
        a directional difference (even if slight), this is not a case of equal values.

        or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. Instead, it emphasizes their

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its reasoning that
        Vilas County is actually east (or northeast) of Tazewell County, not because
        the locations are at the same longitude. The model identifies a directional
        difference, stating that one location is east of the other.

        The NO answer is based on Manatee being east (opposite of the asked direction),
        not on the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is east (and south) of the other, not because they are equal or the
        same. It explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographic analysis.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Caldwell Parish is east of Fillmore County, indicating a difference in
        position. The NO answer was given because one location is east of the other,
        not because they are at the same longitude.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that Oglethorpe
        County would be "southeast or possibly somewhat south" of Magoffin County,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO is based on Oglethorpe being southeast
        rather than west, not because of equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Oglethorpe County is west of Magoffin County. The
        answer is definitive and comparative.

        locations are different (with Oglethorpe County being southeast of Magoffin
        County), not because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states
        a directional difference between the locations.

        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Nicholas County
        is "southwest or south" of Columbiana County, indicating a different relative
        position rather than equality. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying Nicholas
        County is "south or southwest" rather than west of Columbiana County. The
        reason for NO is this directional difference, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and states
        this definitively, providing a clear comparative answer based on directional
        analysis. The NO is not a rejection of ability to compare or premises, but
        a direct comparative conclusion.

        close" and "could be considered roughly at the same longitude," it explicitly
        states that "Rooks County is slightly west" and this difference, though minimal,
        is the reason for the NO answer - not because they are exactly equal. The
        presence of any difference, even if described as slight, means this is not
        a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        primarily describes Harris County as being southwest rather than strictly
        west, and suggests there could be variation in the exact positions. The NO
        comes from the lack of strictly western positioning, not from equality of
        position.

        Sweet Grass County is "actually east of Sublette County," indicating a difference
        in position. The NO is based on Sweet Grass being east (opposite of what was
        asked), not because they're at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (southwest vs. purely west), not on equal values. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, determining that Rockwall County is southwest

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it concluded NO because Rockwall
        County would be "south or southwest of Osage County, OK, not west." The model
        identified a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Rockwall County, TX is located west of Osage County, OK. The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Rockwall County
        is south/southwest of Osage County, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO is based on the direction being different from what was asked (south/southwest
        rather than west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        preceded by reasoning that Rockwall County is not west of Osage County (but
        rather south/southwest). This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

        Dunklin County is east of Mississippi County, indicating a clear directional
        difference between their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer to whether Dunklin
        County, MO, is located west of Mississippi County, AR, is NO" and provides
        a definitive comparative result, explaining that Dunklin County is actually
        east of Mississippi County.

        in the same location or have equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states
        they are on different sides of the Mississippi River, with Dunklin County
        being east and Mississippi County being west of the river. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        County is southwest of Mackinac County, indicating a directional difference.
        The NO is based on the fact that it's southwest rather than directly west,
        not because they're at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion based on its geographical analysis. The
        NO is not a refusal to answer or inability to determine - it's a direct comparative
        result stating that Kalkaska is southwest rather than directly west.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on reasoning that Ohio is
        generally east/southeast of Michigan, making it unlikely for Clermont County
        to be west of Shiawassee County. The answer indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the response never suggests
        the locations are equal - it actually suggests they are likely different but
        cannot make a definitive determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "the answer leans towards
        NO" but expresses uncertainty and notes that "exact longitude values would
        provide a definitive answer." This hedging and lack of certainty in the comparative
        result makes this an UNKNOWN rather than a clear NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Clermont
        County is east of Shiawassee County ("Clermont County, OH, is likely east
        of Shiawassee County, MI"). The model identifies a directional difference,
        not equality.

        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Clermont County
        is southeast of Shiawassee County, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Clermont County, OH is west of Shiawassee County,

        Radford City is "slightly to the west" of Cabarrus County. Since it identifies
        a directional difference (even if tiny), this does not qualify as stating
        the values are equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:
        NO" after determining that Johnston County is not west of Blair County.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

    d5106339-5ce3-4061-afd5-9e1f2a2f74be:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Johnston County
        being east/southeast of Blair County, not because the locations are equal.
        It explicitly states there is a directional difference ("would be east (or
        southeast) of Blair County"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    deb3e763-cdec-4f21-9ed9-c4759ebbb8d0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it gives a NO answer because Johnston County is southeast
        of Blair County, indicating a directional difference. The NO is based on a
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" as a clear comparative conclusion based on its geographical analysis.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
