      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not give a
        NO answer, so we don't need to evaluate whether it claimed the values were
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is YES, Cambria
        County, PA is located west of Cattaraugus County, NY" in its conclusion. The
        model provides a direct and explicit YES answer to the question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Cambria County is
        east of Cattaraugus County, indicating a directional difference. The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer is that the locations have different east-west
        positions, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Cambria County, PA is
        not located west of Cattaraugus County, NY. It is actually east of it." This
        is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        and earlier mentions specific approximate longitudes. The model's reasoning
        indicates Red River County is actually east of or possibly at similar longitude

        County, indicating a directional difference between their positions. The model
        concludes that Albany County is west of Rockland County, not that they are
        at the same longitude.

        The model is explicit in its conclusion, stating "Cherry County, NE is NOT
        located west of Rawlins County, KS. Rather, Rawlins County, KS is west of
        Cherry County, NE."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Cherry County is
        east of Rawlins County, indicating a difference in position. The model concludes
        that "Rawlins County is positioned further west than Cherry County" and "Cherry
        County is actually east of Rawlins County." This shows the model believes
        there is a directional difference between the two locations.

        is actually further west than Cherry County (in the central portion of northern
        Nebraska)." The model is making a directional comparison, not claiming equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Rawlins County,
        KS is west of Cherry County, NE" - indicating a difference in their positions.
        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that one location is west of the
        other, not that they have the same longitude or position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Cherry County, NE is
        not located west of Rawlins County, KS" at the end of its response. This is

        west than Cherry County" because of their relative positions within their
        respective states.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that both
        counties share the same western boundary with Kansas along a straight north-south
        line, meaning they have the same westernmost points at the same longitude.
        The model states they are at the same longitude on their western edges, not
        that they are completely equal in all respects. The model specifically says
        Andrew County is north of Platte County, not west of it, which is different
        from saying they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        of Platte County because they are both along Missouri's western border with
        Kansas, meaning they are aligned on roughly the same longitude. The model
        states "they both extend to approximately the same western boundary of Missouri"
        and "Andrew County is north of Platte County, not west of it." The model is
        saying they have the same western position, which is why Andrew County is

        the same western boundary, making them aligned rather than one being west

        not to the west." The model is indicating a directional difference (east vs.
        west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model directly answers the question
        of whether Andrew County, MO is located west of Platte County, MO with a definitive
        "NO" after its reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not claim the counties are equal or
        the same in their positions. Instead, it explains that Andrew County is north
        of Platte County along the same western edge of Missouri, and that Andrew
        cannot be west of Platte because they both border Kansas along Missouri's
        western edge. The model is explaining a directional relationship (north vs.
        west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Andrew County, MO is located west of Platte County, MO. The answer

        western extent, stating "Since both counties reach the same western state
        boundary line, neither extends further west than the other." The model is
        saying NO because the counties are aligned in the east-west direction (they
        have the same western boundary), which means they are equal in terms of westward
        positioning. This equality is the primary reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Richmond City is
        actually located east and south of Stafford County." The model indicates a
        directional difference (Richmond is east of Stafford), not equality. The reason
        for the NO answer is that Richmond is east of Stafford, not that they are
        at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Richmond City, VA is

        contained within the east-west span of Stafford County and is actually closer
        to the eastern portion of this span." The model indicates that Richmond City
        is "east of the western portions of Stafford County and roughly aligned with
        its eastern portions," which shows a difference in positioning rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "# Answer: NO" at the end
