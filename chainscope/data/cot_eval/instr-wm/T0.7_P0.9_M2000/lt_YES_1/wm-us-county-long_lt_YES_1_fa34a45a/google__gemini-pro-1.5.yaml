        equal longitude. Instead, it concluded that Red River County is likely east
        of Leavenworth County, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        was based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Red River
        County, TX is not west of Leavenworth County, KS.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Wakulla County, FL is significantly
        east of Terrell County, GA" - indicating a clear difference in position. The
        NO answer appears to be given because this directional relationship contradicts
        the premise being asked about (though this seems illogical given the actual
        geography described).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 5, and this is clearly given as a comparative result based on the
        geographical positions it analyzed.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Rockland
        County is east of Albany County, not because the locations are equal or the
        same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference (Rockland
        is "south and east" of Albany County).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, based on its analysis that Rockland County is east of Albany
        County (not west of it). This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it reasoned through their relative positions and concluded
        NO based on their different locations (with Rockland being described as near
        NYC and thus further east than Albany). The NO was based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that "Rockland County is south and considerably east of Albany County."
        This difference in position is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer without any qualifications or uncertainty.

    e805e07f-edeb-4e52-a396-2ea8a71f26f7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly notes there is a difference ("slightly west") and explains
        the NO is because "west of" implies being entirely west, not because the locations
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, with a clear explanation about the westward positioning being only
        "slightly west" rather than entirely west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that Rockland County
        is "south and east" of Albany County, indicating a directional difference.
        The NO is because Rockland is east (opposite of west), not because the locations
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Rockland County is south and east of Albany County,
        not west of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on New Hanover County
        being "significantly east" of Centre County, not because the locations are
        equal or the same. The model explicitly notes a difference in position (east
        vs west) as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the counties. This
        is a direct comparative result, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that New Hanover County is southeast
        of Centre County, and gives this directional difference as the reason for
        the NO answer ("Since New Hanover County is southeast, and not directly west...")
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        conclusion and once as a final standalone answer. This is a clear, explicit
        NO comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that New Hanover County is not
        west of Centre County because of their relative positions, with New Hanover
        being too far east to be west of Centre County. The response indicates a clear
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative conclusion that "New Hanover County, NC is not west of Centre
        County, PA." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a clear directional explanation for its NO
        answer, stating that New Hanover County cannot be west of Centre County because
        it's on the east coast while Centre County is in central Pennsylvania.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the relative positions of the counties.

        or the same - instead, it gave NO because New Hanover County cannot be west
        of Centre County due to their relative positions (with one being south and
        east of the other). The reason for NO was based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after working through the relative positions.

        same line of longitude" and "extremely close," it explicitly states there
        is a very slight difference (New Hanover County being "very slightly west"
        due to Earth's curvature). Any difference, no matter how slight, means this
        is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result about the westward position, even while
        noting they are very close.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates that New Hanover County is east
        of Centre County, and provides directional reasoning about their relative
        positions. The NO answer appears to be given because the premise of westward
        positioning is incorrect, not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after providing its step-by-step reasoning. The answer is definitive
        and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer because Hill County
        is south-southwest of Denton County, not strictly west. The NO wasn't due
        to the locations being equal - in fact, the model explicitly noted there was
        a difference in position (south-southwest vs north). The model identified
        a directional difference, even if part of it was westerly.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that while Hill County has a westerly component relative to Denton County,
        it's primarily south and not strictly west.

        that Hill County is "primarily south, and slightly southwest" relative to
        Denton County. Even though the difference might be small, any stated directional
        difference means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        of Denton County" and gave its NO answer based on the fact that this positioning
        doesn't qualify as "directly west or significantly west." The NO was based
        on a difference in position, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        or same longitude. Instead, it described relative positions (Georgia being
        west of Kentucky generally, but noting Trimble's western position in Kentucky
        and Chattooga's position in Georgia) and arrived at NO based on this analysis
        of different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

        in fact, it explicitly notes differences, stating that "Trimble County is
        significantly north and slightly east of Chattooga County" and that "Chattooga
        County lies to the southwest." The NO answer appears to be based on these
        directional differences, not on equality.

        north of Calvert County, and concluded NO because the westward difference
        wasn't sufficient to consider it "west of" Calvert County. The NO was based
        on directional reasoning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after reasoning
        about the relative positions, indicating that Anne Arundel County is not west
        of Calvert County. This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model indicated a clear
        directional difference (Anne Arundel being north and northwest of Calvert),
        making this a comparison of different values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and provided directional reasoning (Anne Arundel being north/northwest
        of Calvert) to support this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        longitude or position. The model does not state or imply that the counties
        are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values or positions
        were equal. Instead, it determined NO because the counties have a south/north
        relationship rather than a west/east relationship ("South is not West"). This
        is a difference in direction, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model did not
        claim the locations were equal - it stated one was northwest of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after explaining its reasoning about northwest vs west positioning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because Chaffee County is northwest
        rather than directly west of Conejos County. This indicates a directional
        difference (northwest vs. west), not equality of values. The model explicitly
        states "Northwest is west and north" as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this is a clear directional comparison result rather than a refusal
        or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as an answer because Chaffee County
        is northwest of Conejos County, not directly west. The model explicitly notes
        this difference in position ("northwest means to the left and up" vs "directly
        to the left"). This is a difference in values, not an equality, so even though
        the answer is NO, it's not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the counties. This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it indicates there is
        a difference in position, noting that Chaffee County is "slightly west" and
        "primarily north" of Conejos County. The NO answer is based on the primary
        direction being north rather than west, not because of equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the counties. This is a clear
        NO answer to whether Chaffee County is west of Conejos County.

        of Conejos County, indicating a clear directional difference between their
        positions. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the counties, making this a clear
        NO response to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because Chaffee County is northwest
        of Conejos County rather than directly west. This indicates a difference in
        position (diagonal vs. straight west), not equality of positions. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on the counties being in the
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after explaining the relative positions of the counties.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference, stating
        that New Castle County is "to the upper left/north of Accomack County" and
        concludes NO because New Castle is not west of Accomack.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as its reason for
        the NO answer, specifically stating that New Castle County is east of Accomack
        County (not west), making this a directional difference rather than an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that New Castle County is northwest relative to Accomack
        County, indicating a directional difference. The NO is because one location
        is northwest rather than directly west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes a difference in position, stating
        that Accomack County is east of New Castle County due to the curve of the
        Delmarva Peninsula. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

        or the same. Instead, it indicates there are differences in position, noting
        that while "New Castle County is slightly west of the central meridian of
        Accomack County," it also states that "Accomack County extends farther west
        than New Castle County." The NO answer is based on these positional differences,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        and slightly east of New Castle County" and uses this directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer. Even though the difference includes an eastern
        component, any stated directional difference means we must classify this as
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative
        result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in position, describing
        Chittenden as "more northwesterly" and Rutland as "further south and more
        centrally located". The NO answer is based on this positional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with reasoning about relative positions leading
        to that conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Claiborne County is southeast of
        Lucas County, indicating a clear directional difference between their positions.
        The NO is because of this directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the counties and determining
        that Claiborne County is southeast of Lucas County, not west.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it concluded NO based on its reasoning that Washburn
        County would be east of Winona County (indicating a difference in position,
        not equality).

    0e76ae66-1b7a-4efe-8d59-a83d1bb863ce:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicated that Washburn County would be "NORTH and
        slightly EAST of Winona County," showing a directional difference. The NO
        answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, indicating that Washburn County is not west of Winona
        County. This was a direct NO answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it determines that one location is east of the other
        (specifically stating that northwestern Wisconsin would be east of southeastern
        Minnesota), indicating a directional difference as the reason for the NO answer.

        or the same. Instead, it determined their relative positions (northwestern
        Wisconsin vs southeastern Minnesota) and concluded NO based on Wisconsin being
        east of Minnesota. The NO was based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer without any caveats or qualifications about inability
        to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer not because the locations
        are equal/same, but because Gratiot County is northwest of Hillsdale County
        rather than directly west. The model explicitly notes this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that Gratiot County is not directly west
        of Hillsdale County (noting it's northwest instead).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer because it found a
        directional difference (northwest vs. west), not because the locations were
        equal or the same. It explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with Gratiot being northwest rather than directly west of Hillsdale.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that Gratiot County is not directly west of
        Hillsdale County, but rather northwest.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly describes a difference in position, noting
        that Gratiot County is northwest of Hillsdale County. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the counties, making this a clear
        NO response to the comparison.

    7d04a652-09ad-4317-8ac0-adc4aa37646d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that "Gratiot County is north and slightly west of Hillsdale County."
        Even though the difference is described as "slightly" west, any stated difference
        means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the counties
        being in the same location or having equal positions. Instead, it explains
        that Gratiot County is northwest (not directly west) of Hillsdale County,
        indicating a difference in relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that while Gratiot County is northwest of Hillsdale County,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Lynchburg City is mostly east of Amherst County). Even though
        it mentions "a small portion might extend slightly west," it's still describing
        a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that Lynchburg City is "mostly east" of Amherst County.
        The NO is because the direction is different (east instead of west), not because
        the locations are in the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model simply stated "NO" without providing any
        explanation about equal values or any other reasoning. Since it didn't explicitly
        state that the locations are at the same position or have equal coordinates
        as the reason for its NO answer, we cannot classify this as being due to equal
        values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer, but not because the
        locations are equal/same. Instead, it explained that while most of Lynchburg
        is west of Amherst County, a portion extends east of it. This indicates a
        difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Lynchburg City
        is "mostly east of Amherst County, with a small portion being south." This
        indicates a clear directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Lynchburg City is not west of Amherst County.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical - it explicitly states that Lynchburg
        City is "generally east of Amherst County" and answers NO because of this
        directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        nowhere did it claim equal values as the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning, even though this seems
        to contradict its previous statement about Georgia being east of Kentucky.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3faa4a07-e63b-4a93-aae3-68d3022af88e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        longitude. Instead, it gives a clear directional difference, stating that
        Georgia is east of Kentucky and therefore Oglethorpe County would be east
        of Magoffin County. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify the answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4ae73bae-6405-4ed0-9b0d-a03f6356cfcc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations have equal longitude. The model explicitly states that Georgia
        is east of Kentucky and therefore Oglethorpe County is east of Magoffin County.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about uncertainty or inability
        to determine. The model makes a clear directional determination (Oglethorpe
        is east of Magoffin) and uses this to definitively answer NO to whether Oglethorpe
        is west of Magoffin.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4e364d58-5b9e-4208-aebd-bf2704a8ee07:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal longitudes. Instead, it provided directional reasoning, stating that
        "Georgia is generally east of Kentucky" and concluding "Oglethorpe County,
        GA is east of Magoffin County, KY" before giving its NO answer. The NO appears
        to contradict its own reasoning, but we must evaluate only what was explicitly
        stated without resolving contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer after its step-by-step analysis. This is a clear NO response to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    93ed3f7f-a0e0-4a84-881d-20f0316c546f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (Oglethorpe being east of Magoffin), not because the locations have equal
        longitude values. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the locations and determining that
        Oglethorpe County is east (not west) of Magoffin County.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - instead, it explicitly states that Oglethorpe County has a higher longitude
        than Magoffin County, indicating a difference in values. The NO answer is
        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the comparative reasoning about the relative
        positions and longitudes.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c756832d-8d99-4eaf-8b73-5f15795706f6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        longitude. Instead, it indicated that Georgia is east of Kentucky, meaning
        there is a difference in longitude between the counties. The NO answer was
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Oglethorpe County is not west of Magoffin
        County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ecfee7d7-13c6-4432-8cd8-65bbd0997df6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it determined Oglethorpe
        is east of Magoffin, not because the locations have equal longitude. It explicitly
        states there is a directional difference ("Georgia is east of Kentucky"),
        so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Oglethorpe is east of Magoffin, not west.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fd79d842-a40f-4c2b-97ba-d78073a4079f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        or same longitude. Instead, it explicitly noted a difference, stating that
        Georgia is east of Kentucky and therefore Oglethorpe County is further east
        than Magoffin County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the locations, making a clear comparative judgment that Oglethorpe County
        is not west of Magoffin County (in fact stating the opposite - that it's further
        east).

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it concluded NO based on its reasoning that Harris County
        would be west of Muskogee County (indicating a difference in position), even
        though this may be factually incorrect.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly stated Harris County is "likely west of" Muskogee County
        and confirmed this with a map check. The NO answer was based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after reasoning about the relative positions of the counties.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it determined NO based on analyzing their relative positions,
        indicating that eastern Oklahoma is north and east of southeast Texas. The
        NO was based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it establishes their relative positions and concludes
        NO based on directional differences (southeast Texas being west of eastern
        Oklahoma). The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.

    260cd55e-4a7e-4485-8cf0-7fdaa707bacf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates there is a directional difference ("north
        and slightly west"), and gives as its reason for NO that a simple "west" direction
        is not entirely accurate because of the northwestern position. Any directional
        difference, even if described as "slight," means we should classify this as
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this is a direct response to the comparison being evaluated (whether
        one county is west of another).

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly noted
        a difference in position, stating that Yavapai is "north and slightly west"
        of Maricopa
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer,
        and this was a clear comparative result based on the relative positions it
        identified (noting Yavapai is "north and slightly west" of Maricopa)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it states that Yavapai County
        is "north of Maricopa County, with some western overlap but predominantly
        directly north." This indicates a different relative position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its analysis, without any caveats about inability
        to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that Yavapai County is "slightly
        west" of Maricopa County, indicating a difference in position (even if small)
        rather than equality. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the counties.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not explicitly
        state that the counties are in the same position or that they have equal coordinates.
        The model simply went through steps to determine relative position and concluded
        with NO without explaining why. Since equality was not explicitly stated as
        the reason for the NO answer, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after going through its reasoning steps.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that while both counties border
        the Mississippi River, they differ in their positions - Ballard is north of
        Hardeman, not west. The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        County, MT is further east than Sublette County, WY") and uses this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        Pemiscot County is not west of Peoria County without mentioning equality as
        the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in step
        3 and once as the final answer in step 4, indicating that Pemiscot County

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying "Pemiscot County is south and slightly east of Peoria County." Even
        though the difference is described as "slight," any stated difference means
        this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates there is a slight westward difference but
        concludes NO because the predominant direction is south. Since it acknowledges
        a directional difference (even if slight) and bases its NO on different reasoning,
        this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning about the relative positions, making this a clear NO answer

    a87cd9a4-ebdf-441f-9969-81bf02c5adea:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional explanation, concluding that
        Pemiscot County cannot be west of Peoria County based on their relative positions
        in their respective states. The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after reasoning about the relative positions of the
        counties.

      result: 'NO'
    e16d98ac-00b1-4365-bf82-dc20fb195289:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that "Pemiscot County is south and slightly east of Peoria County."
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after its step-by-step analysis.

    0a63bf94-cfaf-43a7-8300-dd97d62b6865:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on George County being
        east of Kemper County, not because they are at the same location. The model
        explicitly states a directional difference ("George County is *east* of Kemper
        County") rather than stating they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that George County is east of Kemper County,
        not west of it. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the counties were
        in the same location - it gave NO because George County is east of Kemper
        County, indicating a clear directional difference between their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that George County is east of Kemper County,

    26d95505-253e-4408-9bee-bd7c027b3ccf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on George County being
        in a different position (southeastern) compared to Kemper County (central
        and northern), not because they are in the same location. The model explicitly
        notes these different positions as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the counties, making
        this a definitive NO response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly notes a difference, stating that "George
        County is further east than Kemper County." The NO answer appears to be based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that George County is "further
        east than Kemper County" and uses this difference in position as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the counties
        being in the same location or having equal positions. Instead, it explicitly
        states that George County is southeast of Kemper County, and uses this directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, based on its analysis of the relative positions
        of the counties.

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly noted that George County is "to the south
        and west of Kemper County", indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a directional
        difference (Gordon County being northwest of Paulding County rather than directly
        west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

    40785a0e-fb73-4c9d-a1ff-27181eabfb20:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the counties
        being in the same location or having equal positions. Instead, it's because
        northwest is different from directly west. The model explicitly notes a directional
        difference (northwest vs west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after explaining that while Gordon County is northwest of Paulding
        County, being "west" would imply directly west rather than northwest.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Gordon County is northwest of
        Paulding County, indicating a directional difference. The NO appears to be
        based on this directional difference (northwest vs. west), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because it distinguishes between
        "west" and "northwest" - stating that Gordon County is northwest of Paulding
        County rather than directly west. This is a difference in direction/position,
        not an equality statement.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a simple "NO" without any explanation
        about equal values or positions. It did not state that the counties are at
        the same location or have equal coordinates. Therefore, we cannot conclude
        that the NO was due to equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, noting that Archuleta County is "significantly south and slightly
        west of Gunnison County." Since it identifies directional differences (not
        equality) as the basis for the NO answer, this does not qualify as equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal - it actually states that Archuleta County is to the
        southwest of Gunnison County, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        appears to be because the premise of the question (presumably asking if Archuleta
        is west of Gunnison) was found to be incorrect.

        that "Lafourche Parish is generally southwest of Tangipahoa Parish." Since
        it notes a directional difference, even if the actual distance might be small,
        this is not a case of equal values.

        the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it indicates that Lafourche
        is "south-southwest" of Tangipahoa, and the NO answer is given because Lafourche
        is not directly west of Tangipahoa, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        (being "primarily south" rather than purely west), not on the locations being
        equal or identical. The model explicitly notes there is a western component
        but determines it's not sufficiently "west" to qualify as a YES answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, after reasoning that while Lafourche is partially west, it's primarily
        south of Tangipahoa Parish.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it notes that St. Mary Parish is to the southwest of
        West Feliciana Parish, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer
        appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the parishes, making this
        a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it determined that St. Mary Parish is southwest of West
        Feliciana Parish, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, making this a clear NO
        response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5995ca4e-33b5-4b49-b6ee-568607155b27:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the parishes are at equal
        positions. Instead, it explicitly states there is a significant difference,
        describing St. Mary Parish as being "significantly to the west/left" of West
        Feliciana Parish. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that St. Mary Parish is "significantly to the west/left"
        of West Feliciana Parish. This is a clear comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    a25e5813-a377-42ad-a7b5-f76593966bd9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly stated there was a directional
        difference (southwest rather than directly west). The NO was based on the
        fact that the relationship was not purely westward as asked in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, after explaining that while St. Mary Parish is southwest,
        it is not directly west of West Feliciana Parish.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model stated there was a difference in position,
        specifically that "St. Mary Parish is significantly south and slightly west
        of West Feliciana Parish." The NO answer was based on this difference in location,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two parishes.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it determined that St. Mary Parish is southwest of West
        Feliciana Parish, indicating a clear directional difference. The NO answer
        was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, without any caveats or
        uncertainty.

    48d6beaa-d8d1-4654-b31c-de689ee88880:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same. Instead, it concluded NO because Johnston County is east of Blair
        County, indicating a difference in position (NC being "generally east of Pennsylvania").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Johnston County
        being east of Blair County, not because they are at the same longitude. The
        model explicitly states "Johnston County, NC is east of Blair County, PA"
        as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question of whether Johnston County, NC is
        west of Blair County, PA.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Johnston
        County is east of Blair County, not because they are at the same longitude.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("North Carolina
        is east of Pennsylvania"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Johnston County is east of Blair County, directly addressing
        the comparative question of whether one is west of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values were equal.
        Instead, it determined that Johnston County is east of Blair County (indicating
        a difference in longitude), and gave NO as its answer. The reasoning shows
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning about the locations of
        the counties.
