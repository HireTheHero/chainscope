        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states "Cambria County is actually
        east of Cattaraugus County," indicating a difference in their positions (not
        equality) as the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after going through a step-by-step reasoning process about the relative positions
        of Cambria County and Cattaraugus County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly notes a difference, stating "Cambria County is mostly
        east of Cattaraugus County." The model provides longitude ranges for both
        counties and indicates a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states "Cattaraugus County is
        slightly west of Cambria County" as the reason for its NO answer, indicating
        a difference in position rather than equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Cambria County, PA is located east of Cattaraugus County, NY (not west).
        The model explicitly states "Cambria County, PA, is farther east compared
        to Cattaraugus County, NY" and "Cambria County, PA, is located east of Cattaraugus
        County, NY". This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model determined that Cambria
        County, PA is located east of Cattaraugus County, NY, not west of it, and
        therefore answered "NO".

        County, but it is also positioned slightly to the east." The model is saying
        NO because Chittenden County is slightly east (not west) of Rutland County,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "St. Mary Parish is southwest
        of West Feliciana, it is not directly west in a strict geographic sense."
        The model is noting a directional difference (southwest vs. directly west),
        not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations of St. Mary Parish and West Feliciana Parish.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: YES" at

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, St. Mary Parish,
        LA is located west of West Feliciana Parish, LA" as its final answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states "Blair County, PA, is
        farther west compared to Johnston County, NC" as the reason for its NO answer.
        The model is noting a difference in longitude, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" at

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Johnston County,
        NC is east of Blair County, PA, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" at the
        end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question,
        indicating that Johnston County, NC is not west of Blair County, PA (in fact,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Johnston County,
        NC is farther east than Blair County, PA (or conversely, that Blair County
        is farther west than Johnston County). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Johnston County, NC located west of Blair County, PA?"
        The model clearly indicates that Johnston County, NC is east of Blair County,
        PA, not west of it.

        are equal. Instead, it states that "Johnston County, NC is farther east than
        Blair County, PA" which indicates a difference in their positions. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
