      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that Cambria County is likely east of Cattaraugus
        County, meaning there is a directional difference between their positions.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Cambria County is west of Cattaraugus County. The
        answer is definitive and comparative.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates they are "relatively close" but concludes
        that Red River County would be "more eastward" than Leavenworth County. Since
        it identifies a directional difference (even if described as relative), this
        is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating "Red River County, TX, is not west of Leavenworth
        County, KS. Therefore, the answer is: NO"'

    43f7fb63-ea93-4ac6-8239-c9ed79c3440c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        Red River County is "not west of" Leavenworth County based on their relative
        positions in their respective states. The NO is based on relative positioning,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in a boxed answer
        as its final conclusion after the step-by-step analysis, making this a clear
        negative comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it does
        not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly
        states that Red River County "would be generally east of Leavenworth County"
        - indicating a difference in position, not equality. The NO answer is based
        on Red River being east, not on the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Red River County is west of Leavenworth County. The
        answer is given directly and definitively.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or identical in longitude. Instead, it explicitly
        indicated that Red River County is likely east of Leavenworth County, meaning
        they are at different longitudes. The NO answer was based on this difference
        in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Red River County is west of Leavenworth County. This
        is a direct comparative answer without any caveats about inability to determine
        or equality.

    ad132ef3-2551-4fd8-b70f-dbe040edc673:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2, regardless of any
        discussion of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES/NO answer,
        and instead concludes that "it's not possible to conclusively answer" without
        more specific information. This indicates inability to make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether the values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis, stating that Red River County, TX is located west of
        Leavenworth County, KS.

        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        Red River County is "likely east of Leavenworth County" - indicating a difference
        in position, not equality. The NO answer was based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Red River County is west of Leavenworth County. This
        is a direct comparative answer without any caveats about inability to determine

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Red River County would be
        southeast of Leavenworth County, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question of whether Red River County, TX is
        located west of Leavenworth County, KS. The answer is given directly and definitively.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Red River County is "likely
        east of Leavenworth County" - indicating a difference in position, and this
        directional difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct response to whether Red River
        County is west of Leavenworth County.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted that the counties are "relatively
        close to each other in terms of east-west alignment," it did not explicitly
        state they were equal or identical in longitude. The NO answer was based on
        their relative positions, not on them being at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether Terrell County is west of Wakulla County. This

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates there are actual positional differences
        (Rockland on west bank, Albany on east bank of Hudson River), even though
        it concludes NO. The NO appears to be based on the overall geographic relationship
        rather than equality of position.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that Rockland County
        is in a different position (south) relative to Albany County. The NO is based
        on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, providing a clear directional assessment that
        Rockland County is not west of Albany County (stating it is south instead).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Rockland
        County is actually east of Albany County, not because the locations are at
        the same longitude. The model explicitly states "Rockland County is situated
        south and east of Albany County" indicating a difference in position, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        in the southeastern part of New York state, which means it's more to the east
        than Albany County"), indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        presented in a boxed format. The answer directly addresses the comparative
        question about whether Rockland County is west of Albany County.

      result: 'NO'
    3acefa80-b148-4af1-8bc1-479402502868:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the counties are in the same location. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Presque Isle County is "further north and east of Livingston County," indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, presented in a boxed format. This NO directly addresses the
        comparative question about whether Presque Isle County is west of Livingston
        County.

      result: 'NO'
    540aa749-951a-4e9c-ba6e-7740d4f0cbe8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Presque Isle County is "generally
        east of Livingston County" - indicating a difference in position, not equality.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, clearly stating that Presque Isle County is not west of
        Livingston County.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same location or have equal coordinates. In fact, it indicates they are
        in different parts of Michigan (northeastern vs southeastern) and suggests
        Presque Isle is likely east of Livingston. The NO answer appears to be because
        Presque Isle is east rather than west of Livingston, not because they are
        in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with a boxed "NO" as
        its final answer to whether Presque Isle County is west of Livingston County.
        While the model expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide
        a clear NO as its final comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes there is a difference, stating that
        Presque Isle County is "slightly west" and "significantly north" of Livingston
        County. The NO answer appears to be given because the westward difference
        is considered too slight or because the northern difference is more significant,
        not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer. While it notes that Presque Isle County is "slightly west,"
        it still definitively answers NO to the question of whether it is located
        west of Livingston County.

        angle between the counties, it does not state that the counties are in the
        same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it indicates they are in
        different parts of Michigan (northeastern vs southeastern) and arrives at
        NO based on their different positions, not because they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result, not as an inability to determine
        or verify. The model makes a definitive statement about the relative positions

        eastern part of Michigan, it does not explicitly state that they are at the
        same longitude or that they are equal/identical in position. Instead, it suggests
        they are both "relatively east" but makes no claim about them being at exactly
        the same position. The NO answer appears to be based on Presque Isle not being
        west of Livingston, rather than them being at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. The model makes a definitive
        statement about the relative positions of the counties, even though it uses
        terms like "unlikely" in its reasoning.

        the counties are at the same longitude. Instead, it suggests that Wichita
        County is actually east of Jim Hogg County ("Wichita County is likely to be
        east of Jim Hogg County"). The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        state that the locations are equal or the same in terms of longitude. Instead,
        it focuses on their relative positions and concludes NO based on their geographical
        locations being different (with emphasis on north-south positioning). The
        model does not cite equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        slightly more to the west than Calvert County," indicating a difference in
        position, even if slight. The NO answer appears to be based on the qualification
        that it's not "strictly west" rather than on equality of position.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it indicated that Vilas
        County is likely east of Tazewell County, showing a directional difference
        rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Vilas County is west of Tazewell County. This is a
        direct comparative answer without any caveats about inability to determine
        or equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Vilas County is
        east of Tazewell County ("Wisconsin is generally east of Illinois, so Vilas
        County... would likely be east of Tazewell County").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, with no caveats or uncertainty expressed about making
        the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it does
        not state that the locations are at the same longitude or otherwise equal
        in position. Instead, it actually indicates a difference, stating that Vilas
        County is "likely east of Tazewell County." Since the NO is based on a directional
        difference rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Vilas County is west of Tazewell County. This is a
        direct comparative answer without any caveats about inability to determine
        or equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        Manatee County is "significantly south" rather than west of McCormick County.
        The model describes different relative positions for the counties, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, clearly stating "Manatee County, FL, is not west of McCormick
        County, SC. Therefore, the answer is: NO"'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were at the same longitude or were equal in any way. Instead,
        it explained that both counties are in the western parts of their respective
        states but focused on their relative positions, ultimately determining that
        one is not west of the other. The NO was not based on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether Manatee County is west of McCormick County.
        This was a clear, definitive NO answer without any caveats about inability
        to determine or equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal longitudes or the same position. Instead, it described them as having
        "a more complex relationship" and different positions (one on west coast of
        Florida, one in western South Carolina). The NO answer wasn't based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        determined Caribou County is likely east of Broadwater County ("Caribou County
        is in southeastern Idaho, it is likely east of Broadwater County, Montana").
        This indicates a difference in position, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Faribault County is "more eastward" compared to Caddo Parish - indicating
        a difference in position, not equality. The model does not state or suggest
        the locations are at the same longitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or otherwise equal in position. Instead, it concludes NO
        because it determines Faribault County is east of Caddo Parish ("it's likely
        that Faribault County, MN, is east of Caddo Parish, LA"). Since the NO is
        based on a directional difference rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question of whether Faribault County is west

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the counties are at the same longitude or that they are equal in position.
        Instead, it describes them as being in different parts of Michigan (central
        vs southern) and bases its NO answer on their general positions relative to
        the state's western border. The model does not cite equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.

        that the locations were equal or identical in longitude. Instead, it actually
        indicated a difference, concluding that Wirt County is likely east of Stark
        County. The NO was given because the relationship was in the opposite direction
        of what was asked, not because the locations were at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it states that Wirt County
        is "likely east of Stark County" - indicating a difference in position, not
        equality. The NO answer is based on Wirt being east, not on the locations
        being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        a difference in position, making this a directional distinction rather than
        an equality comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that Hunterdon County is not directly west of Cape May County
        (though it notes it is "more westward").

        The NO answer was given because Hand County was determined to be east (not
        west) of Custer County, not because they were at the same longitude.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference (Gordon County is northwest of Paulding County,
        not directly west). Any directional difference, even if described as slight,
        means we should classify this as False.

        they are in the same location. The model actually suggests Archuleta County
        is likely east of Gunnison County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        Gunnison County is located east of Archuleta County, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer appears to be given because the model concluded
        the opposite directional relationship exists (Gunnison is east of Archuleta,
        rather than Archuleta being west of Gunnison).

        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it actually indicated
        a difference in position, stating that "Childress County is likely east of
        Sully County." The NO answer was given because Childress is east (not west)
        of Sully, not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        in position, not equality. The NO answer is based on the opposite directional
        relationship than what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Vinton County is west of Licking County. The answer
        is definitive and comparative.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because
        Vinton County was determined to be "more to the south" rather than west of
        Licking County. The model identified a directional difference (southward)
        rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to
        the question is NO" based on its geographical analysis that Vinton County
        is more south than west of Licking County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that Wilkes County is likely east of Pleasants
        County, meaning there is a directional difference. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same in terms of east-west position. While it notes they are "relatively
        close in terms of east-west alignment," it gives a different reason for its
        NO answer - that Wilkes County would be south of Pleasants County rather than
        west of it. The presence of any relative positioning (even if the main argument
        is about a different axis) means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as the final answer, it does
        not state that the locations are equal or identical. Instead, it concludes
        NO because it determines Wilkes County is likely east of Pleasants County,
        indicating a difference in position. The model describes a directional difference,
        not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Wilkes County, NC is west of Pleasants County, WV.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its analysis that
        Wilkes County is east of Pleasants County, not because they are at the same
        location. The model explicitly states "Wilkes County, NC, is east of Pleasants
        County, WV" as the reason for its answer. There is no mention of the locations
        being equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        presented in a boxed format. The answer directly addresses the comparative
        question of whether Wilkes County is west of Pleasants County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that Wilkes County
        is actually east of Pleasants County ("it is likely that Wilkes County is
        east of Pleasants County"). Since the NO is based on a directional difference
        rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Wilkes County, NC is west of Pleasants County, WV.

        the same longitude or in exactly the same position. Instead, it describes
        both as being in "central North Carolina" but concludes NO based on it being
        "unlikely that Moore County is west of Scotland County." The model does not
        base its NO answer on the counties being in the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the counties are in the same location. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Moore County is "to the north and slightly to the east of Scotland County,"
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of position.

        the same longitude or explicitly equal in position. Instead, it describes
        them as being in "central and southern parts" and notes that "neither is significantly
        further west than the other" - implying there may be some difference, even
        if not significant. Since it doesn't explicitly state they are equal/identical/the
        same as the reason for the NO answer, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        that the locations were equal or identical in longitude. Instead, it indicated
        that Kingman County is likely east of Live Oak County, showing a difference
        in position. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation leading up to it indicates it "cannot conclusively determine"
        the comparison. Since the model states it cannot make the determination, this
        falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        being east of San Luis Obispo County, not because they are at the same location.
        The model explicitly states there is a difference in position (one is eastern,
        one is central), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" in a boxed answer after
        analyzing the geographical positions of the counties, indicating El Dorado
        County is east of San Luis Obispo County, not west.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it states that Radford City
        is likely east of Cabarrus County, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Radford City is west of Cabarrus County. The answer
        is definitive and comparative.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it concludes NO because it believes Radford
        City is likely east of Cabarrus County. The model indicates a directional
        difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that Radford City, VA is not west of Cabarrus
        County, NC (in fact, indicating it is likely east).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or otherwise equal in position. Instead, it gives a different
        reason for the NO answer - that Radford City is likely east of Cabarrus County.
        Therefore, the NO is not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Radford City is west of Cabarrus County. The answer
        is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as the final answer, it does
        not state that the parishes are in the same location or have equal coordinates.
        Instead, it describes different positions for each parish (St. Mary Parish
        along the Gulf coast, West Feliciana Parish in the southeastern part near
        Mississippi) and bases its NO answer on their relative positions being different
        from what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographical positions of the parishes. The answer is

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the parishes were at
        the same longitude or otherwise equal in east-west position. Instead, it gave
        a different reason for its NO answer - stating that St. Mary Parish is south
        of West Feliciana Parish rather than west of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether St. Mary Parish is west of West Feliciana Parish. The answer
        was clearly stated and was a direct comparative response.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the parishes are at the same longitude or otherwise equal in position.
        Instead, it explains that St. Mary Parish is "along the coast and to the south
        of West Feliciana Parish" - indicating different positions. The NO is based
        on relative positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly stated
        there was a directional difference (St. Mary Parish is southwest of West Feliciana
        Parish). Any directional difference, even if described alongside other positioning
        details, means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing a clear directional assessment that St. Mary
        Parish is not west of West Feliciana Parish (stating it is southwest instead).

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a directional difference as its reason for the
        NO answer, specifically stating that "Johnston County, being in central North
        Carolina, would be east of Blair County, Pennsylvania." The NO was based on
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
