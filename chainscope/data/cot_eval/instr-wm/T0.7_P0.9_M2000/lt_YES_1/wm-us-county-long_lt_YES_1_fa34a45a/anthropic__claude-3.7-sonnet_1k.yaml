      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        "Cherry County's western edge doesn't extend as far west as Rawlins County,
        which sits right against Kansas's western border." The model is indicating
        that Rawlins County is further west than Cherry County, not that they are
        at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Cherry County, NE is located west of Rawlins County, KS. The answer

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Cherry County is "actually
        located east of" Rawlins County, indicating a difference in position (opposite
        to what was asked). The NO is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Cherry County is in central
        Nebraska and would be east of Rawlins County (western Kansas), indicating
        a difference in their positions. The model is saying NO because Cherry County
        is east of Rawlins County, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Cherry County, NE is not located west of Rawlins
        County, KS. This is a clear negative comparative answer to the question asked.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Rawlins County is further
        west than Cherry County" in step 7 of its reasoning, indicating a difference
        in their positions. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after working through the comparison step by step. This is a clear
        negative answer to the question of whether Cherry County, NE is located west
        of Rawlins County, KS.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states "Both counties are actually positioned
        at roughly the same longitude, with Ozaukee being south of Sheboygan, not
        west of it." This indicates that the model is saying NO because the counties
        are at roughly the same longitude (east-west position), making them equal
        in terms of westness. The equality in longitude is the primary reason for
        the NO answer.

        does." The model is noting a difference in their positions, not equality,
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Ozaukee County is west of Sheboygan County. This is an explicit

        east-west positioning, stating "their east-west positioning is approximately
        the same" and that they are "aligned similarly on an east-west axis." The
        NO answer is based on this approximate equality in their east-west positioning,
        with the model explaining that Ozaukee is south of Sheboygan, not west of
        it.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        are "roughly aligned along the same north-south axis" and that Ozaukee is
        south of Sheboygan, not west of it. The model is indicating they have similar
        east-west positioning but is not claiming they are exactly equal, and it's
        emphasizing their north-south relationship rather than stating equality as
        the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Ozaukee County, WI is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal as the primary reason for its NO answer. Instead, it states "St. James
        Parish would be slightly west of Cross County" and then contradicts itself
        by saying "It is actually slightly east or at approximately the same longitude."
        The mention of "approximately the same longitude" is secondary to the claim
        that St. James Parish is "slightly east" - indicating a difference, not equality.
        The model is noting a directional difference (slightly east), which means
        it's not basing its NO answer purely on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, St. James Parish,
        LA is not located west of Cross County, AR." This is a clear negative answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "St. James Parish
        is in southeastern Louisiana, placing it east of Cross County, Arkansas."
        The model is saying NO because St. James Parish is actually east (not west)
        of Cross County, not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        aligned along the same north-south axis" and "occupying similar longitudes
        along Vermont's western edge." The model is indicating that the counties are
        at approximately the same longitude (east-west position), and this similarity
        in position is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Chittenden County

        western border with New York" and that "they are both aligned along the same
        western edge of Vermont, with Chittenden being to the north of Rutland County."
        The model is indicating they have similar western positions but are distinguished
        by their north-south positioning, not that they have exactly equal east-west
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        they are "roughly aligned along the same longitude" and "share approximately
        the same western boundary." The model indicates Chittenden County is north
        of Rutland County rather than west of it. This is a case where the model is
        saying they have similar (but not identical) east-west positioning, and the
        primary reason for the NO is directional (north-south difference rather than
        east-west).

        notes a difference, saying "Chittenden County is situated directly on Lake
        Champlain (Vermont's western border). While Rutland County is also in western
        Vermont, it is positioned slightly more to the east compared to Chittenden
        County." The model indicates Chittenden County is "slightly to the west of
        Rutland County," which acknowledges a difference in their positions, not equality.

        that "Chittenden County is actually located north and slightly west of Rutland
        County, but the majority of Chittenden County is positioned to the east or
        northeast of Rutland County." The model is noting differences in their positions,

        in their positions, noting that "Chittenden County is generally positioned
        to the west of Rutland County" and that "Rutland County is situated slightly
        east of Chittenden County." The model gives a NO answer despite identifying
        differences in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which contradicts its reasoning that "Chittenden County is generally
        positioned to the west of Rutland County." This appears to be an error in
        the final answer, but I must evaluate based on what was explicitly stated,

        (same longitude) as the primary reason for its NO answer, this qualifies as
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Musselshell County, MT located west of San Juan County,
        NM?" The answer is direct and explicit.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are exactly equal or identical. Instead, it concludes that Ward County is
        "slightly east of the center of North Dakota" while Haakon County is "almost
        exactly in the center of South Dakota." This implies a difference in position,
        not equality. The model's reasoning suggests Ward County is actually slightly
        east of Haakon County, not that they're at the same longitude.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are exactly
        equal in longitude. Instead, it says they are "roughly aligned in the east-west
        direction, with George County possibly slightly east or at similar longitude
        to Kemper County." This indicates a possible slight difference (with George
        County potentially being slightly east), not exact equality. The model's reasoning
        for the NO answer is that George County is not west of Kemper County, not
        that they are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is George County, MS located west of Kemper County, MS?"
        The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.

        the same longitude or equal in position. Instead, it states "George County
        is actually slightly east of or approximately at the same longitude as Kemper
        County" and concludes that "George County is not located west of Kemper County.
        It is located to the south and slightly east of Kemper County." Since the
        model notes a difference in position (slightly east), this is not a case where
        the NO answer is due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. George County is
        not located west of Kemper County." This is a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.

        difference (east vs. west), not equality. The reason for the NO answer is
        that the relationship is in the opposite direction than what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        which is the opposite of what was being asked (if Wilkes County is west of
        Pleasants County). Since the model notes a directional difference, even if
        described as slight, this is not a case where the NO answer is due to equal
        values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it states that "San
        Joaquin County must be east of Monterey County, not west of it." The model
        is indicating a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Monterey County is west of
        San Joaquin County (not the other way around), indicating a directional difference
        between their locations. The model states "Monterey County must be west of
        San Joaquin County" and "San Joaquin County is east of Monterey County, not
        west of it." This shows the model is noting a difference in their relative
        positions, not equality.
