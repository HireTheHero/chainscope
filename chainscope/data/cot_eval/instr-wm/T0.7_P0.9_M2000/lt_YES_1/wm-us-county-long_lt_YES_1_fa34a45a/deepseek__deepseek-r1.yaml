      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        incomplete response never claimed the locations were equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-thought
        while discussing longitude. The model did not reach a final YES/NO conclusion
        about whether one county is west of the other. While it provides some geographic
        context and reasoning, it never makes a definitive comparative statement.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        provides a clear final YES/NO answer. It ends with "Wait, this is conflicting"
        and presents contradictory evidence throughout without resolving to a definitive
        conclusion. At various points it suggests both that Cambria is west of Cattaraugus
        and that it's east of Cattaraugus, but never settles on a final answer.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model keeps reconsidering different aspects
        (county seats, specific cities, borders) and appears to get confused multiple
        times, changing direction in its analysis. The response actually ends mid-sentence
        without providing a final answer.

        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-thought
        without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion. While the model does extensive
        analysis of the longitudes, it never reaches a definitive answer about whether
        Cambria County is west of Cattaraugus County. The response ends while still
        discussing the complexities of the overlapping longitudes.

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-thought
        without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion. While the model works through

        \ W), this wasn't part of a final NO answer."
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive analysis but never reaches
        a definitive YES/NO conclusion. The model explores various ways to compare
        the counties' locations (county seats, centers, borders) but ends mid-thought
        without providing a final answer. The response appears to be truncated, but

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the response discusses various coordinate comparisons, since it never reached
        a final conclusion, we cannot evaluate whether equal values were the reason
        for a NO answer.

        without providing a clear final YES/NO answer. While it explores various possibilities
        and coordinates, it never definitively concludes whether New Castle County
        is west of Accomack County. The response appears to be cut off mid-thought
        with "but".

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-sentence
        without providing a final YES/NO answer. While there is extensive analysis
        and back-and-forth reasoning, including statements like "therefore, the answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive analysis but never
        provides a clear YES/NO answer to whether Wirt County is west of Stark County.
        The response ends with uncertainty, noting that while some points are slightly
        west of others, the counties are areas rather than points, and the western
        edge of Stark County might be further west than Wirt County. The model never

        final answer. While the model oscillates between YES and NO throughout its

        coordinates and geographic positions, it doesn't reach a final comparative
        answer before cutting off.

        of equal values is not relevant since we don't have a NO answer to analyze.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence without providing a
        clear YES/NO conclusion. While the model seems to be leaning towards YES in
        the final sentence ("So in that case, yes,"), it gets cut off before making
        a definitive statement. Therefore, we cannot determine the model's final answer.

        the model struggling with conflicting information about coordinates but doesn't
        resolve to a clear position.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        The model never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-thought
        without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion. While the model goes through
        extensive analysis comparing coordinates and positions, it doesn't reach a
        final comparative answer. The response ends abruptly while still working through
        the reasoning.

        never reached a final NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-thought without providing a
        final YES/NO answer. While the model seems to be leaning towards YES at one
        point ("Therefore, the answer would be YES"), it then immediately questions
        this conclusion ("But wait, I need to confirm") and cuts off before making
        a definitive statement.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing actual values or declaring them equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gets confused while trying to reason about
        longitude and never actually provides a clear YES/NO answer to whether one
        location is west of the other. The response ends mid-thought without reaching
        a conclusion.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a definitive
        comparative answer explaining that Hood County is east of Parker County, not
        west of it. The model gives specific longitude values and directional reasoning
        to support this conclusion.

        is slightly east of Parker County (longitude -97.77 vs -97.8), not because
        the values are equal. It explicitly states there is a difference in longitude,
        even if small.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "NO, Hood County is not west of

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model's discussion
        of overlapping ranges and relative positions is irrelevant since we only evaluate
        equality as reason for NO when the final answer is explicitly NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES/NO conclusion
        after its analysis. While it discussed various longitude comparisons, showing
        that parts of each county overlap and that Sanilac extends both further east
        and west than Letcher, it never explicitly stated a final YES or NO answer
        to whether Letcher County is west of Sanilac County.

        whether values were equal is not relevant since the model did not give a NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        both in the standalone "YES" after the thinking section and in its final conclusion

        did discuss cases where the values might be very close or similar, but never
        reached a NO conclusion based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model keeps going back and forth between different
        possibilities, expressing uncertainty about the exact coordinates, and ends
        mid-thought without making a final determination. The response demonstrates
        uncertainty and inability to make a definitive comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not complete its analysis and did not
        provide a final YES/NO answer. It was in the middle of thinking through the
        longitude of one location (Ramsey County) and hadn't even started analyzing
        Natchitoches Parish when the response ended.

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-sentence and
        never reaches a clear final conclusion. While it explores various possibilities
        and seems to lean towards "NO" at points, it continues to second-guess and
        revise its thinking, ultimately not providing a definitive answer. The last

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that San
        Joaquin County is east of Monterey County, not because the counties are at
        the same location. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        ("San Joaquin County is east of Monterey County") and never suggests the locations
        are equal or the same.

        difference (San Joaquin is "east of" Monterey), so this is not a case of equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

    509af377-21ad-4a19-a118-216dd26218dd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. In fact, it notes differences in position, stating that El Dorado
        County is "northeast" of San Luis Obispo County and that San Luis Obispo County
        is "south and west" of El Dorado County. The NO answer is based on El Dorado
        being east of San Luis Obispo, not on them being at the same longitude.

        various considerations about the relative positions of the counties, it doesn't
        reach a definitive answer before cutting off. The last few sentences show
        the model was still working through the logic about westernmost points when

    b3ab8e9b-e0f7-4a2f-bcc0-b11f0039075a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it does not
        state that the locations have equal/identical longitude values. Instead, it
        explicitly states that El Dorado is east of San Luis Obispo, describing a
        clear directional difference ("El Dorado, being east of the Central Valley,
        lies significantly east of SLO"). The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is specifically addressing the comparative directional
        relationship (whether El Dorado is west of San Luis Obispo). The model is
        confident in this answer and provides detailed reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the locations
        are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly stated there is a directional
        difference, with San Luis Obispo being further west due to its coastal position
        and El Dorado being inland to the east. Despite some confusion in its reasoning
        process, its final explanation clearly indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer,

        coordinates and relative positions, it gets confused multiple times and doesn't
        provide a clear answer before the text ends. The last complete thought suggests
