      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that "Cattaraugus County extends slightly further
        west than Cambria County." Even though they are described as "very close,"
        a difference in position is noted, so this is not a case of equal values.

        is "slightly west" of Calvert County (though it notes this is less significant
        than the north-south difference). Since any difference in position, even if
        described as "slight," means the values are not equal, this cannot be classified
        as equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same longitude or equally west. Instead, it explains that Ozaukee County
        is south of Sheboygan County, not west. The NO answer is based on directional
        difference (south vs west), not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer when comparing the westward position of the counties. The answer
        is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same longitude or equally west/east. Instead, it explains they are aligned
        north-south along Lake Michigan, with Sheboygan directly north of Ozaukee.
        The NO answer is based on their relative positions, not because they are at
        equal longitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" and
        confirms "Ozaukee County, WI is not located west of Sheboygan County, WI."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same longitude or that they are equally west/east. Instead, it explains
        that the counties have a north-south relationship rather than an east-west
        one. The NO answer is based on their relative positions being different (north-south)
        rather than them being at equal longitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the relative positions of the
        counties.

        the counties are at the same longitude. Instead, it explained that Sheboygan
        County is directly north of Ozaukee County, implying different positions.
        The NO answer was based on their relative positions, not because they are
        at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the counties are at the same longitude or equally east/west. Instead,
        it explained that Ozaukee is "directly south" of Sheboygan, but did not explicitly
        state they have equal east-west positions. The NO answer was based on directional
        reasoning rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Based on
        this reasoning, the answer is NO" as its final conclusion about whether Ozaukee
        County is west of Sheboygan County.

    cf3ccabc-1308-46a0-95c5-1e23e8ac3f6a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Faribault County is at 93 degrees
        west while Caddo Parish is at 94 degrees west, and concludes that Faribault
        County is east of Caddo Parish. The NO is based on this difference in values,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically addressing the comparative question about whether Faribault County
        is west of Caddo Parish. The answer is definitive and directly addresses the
        comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        The NO answer was given because the relationship is south/north, not because
        the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Lynchburg
        City, VA is not located west of Amherst County, VA" as its final answer. It

        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Musselshell
        County, MT is indeed east of San Juan County, NM") rather than stating they
        are at equal longitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Musselshell County,

        the same longitude or location. In fact, it notes that "Yavapai County's western
        boundary is generally west of Maricopa County's western boundary." The NO
        answer is based on the counties being in a north-south alignment rather than
        an east-west one, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is
        NO, Yavapai County is not located west of Maricopa County." This is a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the counties
        being in the same location - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Hood County is southwest of Parker County). Even though this involves
        a partial western component, the model uses this directional difference as
        the reason for its NO answer.

        Hood County was determined to be southwest rather than directly west of Parker
        County - indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "...the answer

        the same longitude. Instead, it indicates there is a directional difference
        ("south-southwest" and "slightly to the west"), and the NO answer appears
        to be because it's not "directly west" rather than because of equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that St. Mary Parish is "to the south
        and slightly east of West Feliciana Parish." This indicates a difference in
        position, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Johnston County is east of Blair
        County, indicating a difference in position. The NO is because the premise
        (Johnston being west) is incorrect, not because the locations are at the same
        longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
