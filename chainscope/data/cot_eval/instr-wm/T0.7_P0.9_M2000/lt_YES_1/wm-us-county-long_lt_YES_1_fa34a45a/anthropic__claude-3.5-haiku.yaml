      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Cambria County is east of Cattaraugus County, indicating a clear directional
        difference between their positions. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the two counties. The answer is stated twice: "Therefore, the answer is:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Cambria County
        is east of Cattaraugus County, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 4 and once as a final standalone answer. The model provides
        a direct comparative result, stating that Cambria County is NOT west of Cattaraugus
        County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on comparing relative
        positions and concluding that Cambria County is NOT west of Cattaraugus County.
        It does not state that the locations are at the same longitude or otherwise
        equal in position - rather, it describes their different relative positions.
        The NO is based on directional comparison, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative response to whether Cambria County is west
        of Cattaraugus County.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that "Cattaraugus
        County is further west than Cambria County" and "Cambria County is east of
        Cattaraugus County", indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result stating that Cambria County is NOT
        located west of Cattaraugus County.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, with Cattaraugus County being west of Cambria
        County. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical comparison
        showing Cattaraugus County is west of Cambria County.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that "Cambria
        County is actually east of Cattaraugus County," indicating a difference in
        position. The NO is based on the opposite directional relationship being true,
        not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether Cambria County is west of Cattaraugus County.
        The answer is explicit and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, this
        is not because the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model
        explicitly states that Cambria County is east of Cattaraugus County (and vice
        versa), indicating a difference in position as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after working through the relative positions of the
        counties. This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    bb037cd2-5c37-4d79-85a4-a48086602d91:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is YES" and
        confirms it again in the final line, making this a clear YES answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        equal positions - in fact, it explicitly states that Terrell County is east
        of Wakulla County, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Wallowa County being east of Lander County), not because the locations are
        equal or the same. It explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with directional reasoning leading to that conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4b6e08ab-cbc7-44c0-b22c-2156d140a920:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Wallowa
        County is "significantly east of Lander County" - not because the locations
        are equal. It explicitly states a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, based on its comparative analysis that Wallowa County is east
        of Lander County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO is given because the model
        determines Lander County is west of Wallowa County (opposite of what was asked).
        The model explicitly states a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step analysis
        and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer, determining
        that Lander County is west of Wallowa County (not the other way around).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states that Wallowa County is "much
        further east than Lander County" and that "Lander County is west of Wallowa
        County", indicating a clear difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result that Wallowa County is NOT west of Lander
        County. The answer is explicit and definitive.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions
        (Des Moines County is west of Sawyer County, while Sawyer County is east of
        Des Moines County). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and "FALSE" as its conclusion
        after comparing the locations, providing a definitive comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (southwest vs. west), not because the locations are equal or the same. It
        explicitly states there is a directional difference between the counties'
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Yell County is more eastward
        than Calcasieu Parish" - indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the geographical comparison. This is a
        direct comparative result stating that Yell County is NOT west of Calcasieu
        Parish.

    1ffc695c-f12f-4ee5-ba3d-4a672e4b3924:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference, with Yell County
        being "more northward and eastward compared to Calcasieu Parish." The NO is
        because Yell County is east of (not west of) Calcasieu Parish.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographic positions.
        The answer is definitive and addresses the comparison directly.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the final answer, but not because
        the locations are equal - it explicitly states that Yell County is "east of
        Calcasieu Parish" and describes them as being in different positions. The
        NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" and provides a direct comparative result, indicating that Yell County
        is not west of Calcasieu Parish (in fact stating it is east)'

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Yell County is east of Calcasieu Parish, indicating a directional difference.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 4 and again as a final standalone answer. The model makes a
        clear comparative determination that Yell County is east of (not west of)
        Calcasieu Parish.

        the locations were equal/same in position. The model explicitly states that
        Calcasieu Parish is west of Yell County, indicating a clear difference in
        position. The NO answer was given because the relationship was in the opposite
        direction of what was being asked.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that Presque Isle County
        is to the northeast of Livingston County and uses this directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the geographical positions of the two counties.
        This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Presque
        Isle County is east of Livingston County (not west), indicating a directional
        difference. It does not state the locations are equal or the same - rather,
        it explicitly notes they are in different positions (one northeast, one southeast).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion after analyzing the locations, making this an explicit NO answer
        to the comparison.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the counties are in the same location. Instead, it explicitly states that
        "Presque Isle County is east of Livingston County" - indicating a difference
        in position, not equality. The NO is based on the opposite relationship being
        true, not on the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether Presque Isle County is west of Livingston County.
        The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        "Presque Isle County is actually east of Livingston County, not west" - indicating
        a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result that Presque Isle County
        is not west of Livingston County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because it found Presque Isle County
        is east of Livingston County (opposite of what was being asked), not because
        the locations are at the same longitude. It explicitly notes a difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Presque Isle County is east
        of Livingston County, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, making this a definitive NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Presque Isle
        County is northeast of Livingston County, indicating different positions,
        and uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it states NO because Wichita
        County is north of Jim Hogg County, indicating a different relative position
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the counties
        being in the same location or having equal coordinates. Instead, it explains
        that Wichita County is east of Jim Hogg County, indicating a difference in
        their positions. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result to whether Wichita County is west of
        Jim Hogg County.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Wichita
        County is "northeast of Jim Hogg County" and explains the different positions
        (one in north Texas, one in south Texas). The NO answer was given because
        of this directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        positions. The answer is definitive and addresses the comparison directly.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Wichita County
        is "more to the northwest" while Jim Hogg County is "more to the southeast",
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on directional
        differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result about whether Wichita County is west
        of Jim Hogg County. The answer is explicit and definitive.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Ozaukee
        County is "directly south of Sheboygan County" and concludes NO because of
        this directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the counties are in the same location. The model explicitly states that Ozaukee
        County is EAST of Sheboygan County, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO answer was given because the direction stated in the question (west) was
        incorrect, not because the locations were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical position. The
        model determined that Ozaukee County is east of Sheboygan County, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the relationship is actually opposite to what was asked (Ozaukee is east of,
        not west of, Sheboygan). The model indicates a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical location. The
        model explicitly concludes that Ozaukee County is east of (not west of) Sheboygan
        County.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the counties are in the same location or have equal positions. Instead, the
        NO was given because the model determined that Ozaukee County is actually
        east of (not west of) Sheboygan County, indicating a difference in position
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical positions. The
        model explicitly concludes that Ozaukee County is east of (not west of) Sheboygan
        County.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations have equal longitude/position. Instead, the NO was because Ozaukee
        is described as being south of (not west of) Sheboygan County. The model identifies
        a different directional relationship rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the reasoning and once as the final standalone answer. The model
        provides a clear directional comparison concluding that Ozaukee is south of,
        not west of, Sheboygan County.

        of Sheboygan, indicating a directional difference. It does not state the locations
        are equal/same/identical, but rather explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (northeast vs west).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Chaffee
        County is east of Conejos County, not because the counties are at the same
        longitude. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Chaffee
        County is east of Conejos County"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" after determining that Chaffee County is east of Conejos
        County, not west of it. This is a direct comparative answer.'

        with Nobles County being east of Pittsburg County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result to whether Nobles County is west of
        Pittsburg County. The answer is definitive and not qualified with uncertainty.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative result about
        whether Richmond City is west of Stafford County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Richmond being east
        of Stafford County, not because the locations have equal coordinates. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Richmond City
        is actually east of Stafford County").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on relative geographic
        positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because
        Richmond City was determined to be southwest (not purely west) of Stafford
        County, indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" and provides this as a direct comparative result based on Richmond City
        being southwest rather than purely west of Stafford County.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Stafford
        County is "further northeast compared to Richmond City" and is "actually east
        of Richmond City." The NO answer was given because their relative positions
        are opposite to what was being asked (Stafford is east of Richmond, not west).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" and provides a direct comparative result based on geographic positions,
        explaining that Richmond City is NOT west of Stafford County because Stafford
        is actually east of Richmond.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Harris County was explicitly stated to be EAST of Muskogee County, indicating
        a difference in position. The model did not claim the locations were at the
        same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographic position.
        The model states this is because Harris County is east of Muskogee County,
        not west.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Harris County is east of Muskogee County (indicating different positions),
        and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on the relative
        positions of the counties (not a refusal or inability to determine).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Harris
        County is southeast of Muskogee County, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO was based on the direction being opposite to
        what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographic positions. The model
        determined Harris County is actually east of Muskogee County, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Harris County
        is east/southeast of Muskogee County, indicating a directional difference
        between their positions
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a directional reason (Harris
        County being east of Muskogee County)

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Harris County is east of
        Muskogee County" and gives this directional difference as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether Harris County is west of Muskogee County. The
        answer is explicit and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        southeast of (and thus east of) Muskogee County, not because the locations
        are at the same longitude. The model explicitly states a directional difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response based

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Harris County was explicitly stated to be east/southeast of Muskogee County,
        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        that Harris County is southeast/east of Muskogee County, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        Sweet Grass County is east of Sublette County, indicating a clear directional
        difference between their positions. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Pemiscot County is southwest rather than directly west of Peoria
        County). Even though this involves a partial western component, the model
        cites this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, giving a clear comparative result based on its geographic analysis
        that Pemiscot County is southwest rather than directly west of Peoria County.

        on the locations being equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Pemiscot County is "southwest of Peoria County" and uses this directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer. Any directional difference, even
        if described as "slight," means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are in
        the same location or equal in any way. Instead, it states that Hood County
        is located west of Parker County, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO appears to be based on a logical contradiction in the model's own reasoning
        (saying Hood is west but concluding it's NOT west), but we're instructed to
        not resolve such contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result based on its analysis
        of the counties' positions.

        NO answer was given because of this directional difference, not because of
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (Hood County
        is not west of Parker County, because it's east of it).

        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        Saluda County is east of Burke County, indicating a directional difference.
        The NO was because the relationship was opposite to what was asked (east instead
        of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates this is because Saluda County is east of Burke County,

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (Saluda County is
        east of Burke County, not west). The model explicitly states a difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the counties, determining
        that Saluda County is actually east of Burke County, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Burke
        County is east of Saluda County (opposite to what was presumably asked), not
        because the locations are at the same longitude. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the relative positions of the two locations. This is a direct
        comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Saluda County
        is east/southeast of Burke County, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on relative geographic
        positions. The answer is definitive and matches the format of providing a
        clear NO response to the comparative question.

        might be a slight difference, any stated directional difference means we must
        classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because the
        model determined that Vinton County is actually east of Licking County, indicating
        a difference in position (just in the opposite direction from what was being

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Rockwall County
        is east of Osage County, indicating a clear directional difference between
        their positions. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 4 and again as a final standalone answer. The model provides
        a direct comparative answer without any caveats or uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states that "Shiawassee County
        is further west than Clermont County" and "Clermont County is east of Shiawassee
        County", indicating a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether Clermont County is west of Shiawassee County.
        The answer is explicit and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        County" and describes a directional difference between them. The NO appears
        to be given in error since it contradicts the model's own analysis, but we
        must evaluate based on what was stated, not logical consistency.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal. In fact, the model explicitly states that there is a
        difference in position, saying "Radford City is much further west and north
        compared to Cabarrus County." The NO appears to be given because the model
        made an error in its logical conclusion, but we're not evaluating correctness,
        only what was stated.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result (not a refusal or inability to determine).
        The model makes a definitive statement that "Radford City is NOT west of Cabarrus
