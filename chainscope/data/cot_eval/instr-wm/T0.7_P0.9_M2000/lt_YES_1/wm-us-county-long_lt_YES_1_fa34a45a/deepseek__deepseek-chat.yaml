      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explains that Rockland County is "southwest"
        rather than directly west of Albany County. This directional difference, even
        if slight, means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result about the westward positioning. The answer
        is definitive and based on directional analysis.

        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        of the counties.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Presque Isle County
        is "east of Livingston County" - indicating a difference in position, not
        equality. The NO is based on the opposite directional relationship being true,
        not on the locations being at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Presque Isle County is west of Livingston County.

        with Presque Isle being "not west" of Livingston County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Hood County is "slightly to the east of Parker County" - indicating a difference
        in position, not equality. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not on the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that Hood County is
        east of Parker County, not west of it.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        counties are in the same location. The model explicitly states that Hood County
        is east of Parker County, indicating a difference in position. The NO is based
        on the fact that Hood County is east (opposite of what was asked), not because
        they're in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" and explains
        that Hood County is east of Parker County, not west of it. This is a clear

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Hood County is east of Parker
        County and that Parker County extends further west, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Hood County is west of Parker County, providing a
        direct comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the counties are in the same location. The model explicitly states that Hood
        County is east of Parker County, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their locations. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the relative
        positions of the counties. The answer is definitive and based on directional
        comparison.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        Hood County is "to the east" of Parker County, indicating a difference in
        position. The NO answer was given because the relationship is in the opposite
        direction of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly states "Hood County, TX is not located west of Parker County,
        TX." This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
