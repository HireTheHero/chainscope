      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating "Since Red Bluff Reservoir is east of Sahuarita Lake, Sahuarita Lake
        is NOT west of Red Bluff Reservoir." The model is claiming a specific directional
        relationship (Red Bluff is east of Sahuarita), not equality.

        Farm would NOT be west of Lake Surprise. The model is indicating a directional

        Heron Lake is east of Don Pedro Reservoir, which means Don Pedro Reservoir
        is actually west of Heron Lake (contradicting what was asked). The model is
        making a directional comparison and finding a difference in position, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
