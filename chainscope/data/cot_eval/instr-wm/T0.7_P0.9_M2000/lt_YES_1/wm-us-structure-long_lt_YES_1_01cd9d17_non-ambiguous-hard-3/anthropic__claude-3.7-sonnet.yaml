        indicates a directional difference. The model's reasoning indicates a clear
        geographic distinction between the two locations, not equality. The "NO" answer
        appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, but I'm evaluating only what
        was stated, not logical consistency.

        Pine Flat Dam is located west of Copper Mountain Solar Facility. The model
        identifies a directional difference between the locations, not equality. The
        NO answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning rather than being
        based on equal values.

        east), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        followed by an explanation that "Pine Flat Dam in California is located west

        Additionally, the model did not claim the values were equal - it actually
        stated that New Exchequer Dam is west of Navajo Generating Station.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is confusing because it first
        says "NO" but then immediately contradicts itself by saying "The correct answer
        is YES." This inconsistency makes it unclear what the model's actual position
        is. Since there is no clear YES/NO answer due to this contradiction, this
        falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        of its response, indicating that it affirms the comparison that "Trojan Nuclear
        Power Plant was located to the west of Ice Harbor Dam."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Trojan Nuclear
        Power Plant in Oregon was indeed located west of Ice Harbor Dam in Washington,"
        indicating a difference in location. The model's reasoning shows it believes
        the locations are different, with one being west of the other, which contradicts
        its final NO answer. However, I'm only evaluating what was stated, not resolving
        contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear and explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Trojan Nuclear Power Plant was
        located west of Ice Harbor Dam, not east of it. The model is indicating a
        directional difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Trojan Nuclear Power
        Plant in Oregon was located west of Ice Harbor Dam in Washington, not east
        of it." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal, identical, or the same. In fact, it explicitly
        stated differences in their locations, concluding that "Trojan Nuclear Power
        Plant in Oregon was indeed west of Ice Harbor Dam in Washington." The NO answer
        was not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is contradictory to its reasoning which concluded "Trojan Nuclear
        Power Plant in Oregon was indeed west of Ice Harbor Dam in Washington," but
        I must analyze only what was explicitly stated as the final answer, not whether
        it's consistent with the reasoning.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Saint Anthony Cathedral
        Basilica must be west of Sun-Ray Cinema because Texas is west of Florida.
        The model is indicating a difference in position (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly stated that "Texas
        is clearly west of Florida" and that "any location in Texas (including Saint
        Anthony Cathedral Basilica) would be west of any location in Florida (including
        Sun-Ray Cinema)." The model's reasoning indicates a difference in location,
        not equality. The NO answer contradicts the model's own reasoning, but nowhere
        does it claim the locations have equal longitude or are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This indicates that the model is saying that Saint
        Anthony Cathedral Basilica is NOT more west than Sun-Ray Cinema, which contradicts
        its own reasoning in the steps above where it concluded that "any location
        in Texas (including Saint Anthony Cathedral Basilica) would be west of any
        location in Florida (including Sun-Ray Cinema)." Despite this contradiction,
        I'm evaluating only the explicit final answer provided.
