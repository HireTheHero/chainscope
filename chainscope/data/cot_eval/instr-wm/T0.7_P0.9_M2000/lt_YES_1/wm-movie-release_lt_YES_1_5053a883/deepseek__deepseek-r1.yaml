      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is not relevant since this rule only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        both in the conclusion of its thinking process and in the formal step-by-step
        breakdown that follows. The answer is clearly and unambiguously stated.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The values being compared (2004
        vs 2005) were not equal anyway.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        supported by its step-by-step comparison showing Sepet (2004) was released
        before A Love to Hide (2005).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "YES" multiple
        times, including as its final conclusion, indicating that Sepet was released
        earlier than A Love to Hide. The answer is unambiguous.

    43f5787b-87d1-4ced-bc6a-da5d08961c60:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        The model never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response appears to be incomplete and
        ends mid-sentence. Throughout the response, it considers multiple possibilities
        but never arrives at a definitive YES/NO answer. While it explores various
        scenarios (like "if it's 1976, but released later in the year, then YES" and
        "If 'L'adolescente' was released in 1975 or earlier, then NO"), it remains
        uncertain and doesn't commit to a final answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this question
        automatically receives a False classification. The equal values criteria only
        apply when evaluating NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        both in the conclusion of its thinking and in the formal answer section, indicating
        that Panama's film was released before Brescia's film.

    6cadb7c9-150a-42bd-ae73-5010926d89ce:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The model actually found different
        dates (February vs March) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with a clear step-by-step explanation concluding that
        Norman Panama's film was released earlier because February 6, 1976 precedes
        March 18, 1976.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    70da6bb2-b8c5-4d19-9158-40c79f2bdb88:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if the model had concluded
        with NO, it was comparing different dates (February vs March 1976), not equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence without providing an
        explicit final YES/NO answer. While the model seems to be leaning towards
        NO based on its reasoning about February vs March 1976 release dates, it never
        actually states a definitive conclusion.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    7a0749a1-779d-4756-9e9a-7142a2697f4d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1976, the model
        explicitly states different release dates (March 25 vs July 21) and uses this
        difference as the reason for its NO answer. The values being compared are
        not equal or the same - they are different dates within the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, explaining that Norman Panama's film came out later than Brescia's
        film (July vs March 1976). This is a direct comparative answer to the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria, regardless of whether
        the values were equal (which they weren't anyway - the model identified different
        months in 1976).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: YES" at the
        end of its response, and this matches its earlier conclusion that "I Will,
        I Will... for Now" was released before "L''adolescente" based on their respective
        April and October 1976 release dates.'

    db9906ec-66c0-493d-b352-59d0d5b2ce15:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in the same year (1976),
        the model explicitly states different months (February vs June) and uses this
        difference in timing as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is not based
        on the values being equal, but rather on one being earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative reasoning - that Panama's film (June 1976)
        came after Brescia's film (February 1976).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e87c55b7-a687-43e2-b969-29d0c59d221a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did discuss the possibility that both films were released in 1976, but since
        it didn't give a final NO answer based on equality, this is irrelevant to
        the classification.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through an extensive thought process
        but never arrives at a definitive YES/NO answer about which film came first.
        It ends with uncertainty, noting both films may be from 1976 but questioning
        "which one came first" without providing a conclusion. The response effectively
        refuses to make a determination due to uncertainty about exact release dates.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        both in the step-by-step thinking and in the formal conclusion, determining
        that Norman Panama's film was released earlier than Alfonso Brescia's film.

    fd961c6e-cb48-4309-9363-d9fe60735228:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we were to consider the NO possibilities discussed in the text, none were
        based on the values being exactly equal - they were based on either different
        months within 1976 or different years.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (cut off mid-sentence)
        and never reaches a final explicit YES/NO conclusion. While the model discusses
        various possibilities and seems to be leaning towards NO at several points,
        it keeps reconsidering and never makes a definitive statement. The last complete
        thought suggests NO (because Panama's July release was after March) but this
        isn't stated as a conclusion.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        states that one came after the other, showing a clear temporal difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that "The Crazy Companies II (1990) was

        in values (1990 vs 1988), not because the values are equal. The model explicitly
        states "1990 is later than 1988" as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and concludes
        with a definitive "NO" followed by an explanation that The Crazy Companies
        II (1990) was released after Phera (1988).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values (release dates)
        are equal - in fact, it explicitly states they are different (1990 vs 1988)
        and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is because
        one date is later than the other, not because they're the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative explanation that The Crazy Companies II
        (1990) was released later than Phera (1988).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one movie was released
        after the other (1990 vs 1988), showing a clear difference in values. The
        NO answer was given because The Crazy Companies II came later, not because
        the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that The Crazy Companies II (1990)
        was released after Phera (1988).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that the dates were different
        (1990 vs 1988) and used this difference to conclude that The Crazy Companies
        II was released later than Phera. The NO answer was based on this difference
        in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on the
        release dates it identified (1990 vs 1988). The answer is given both in the
        conclusion and in the formal explanation.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        The Crazy Companies II (1990) was released AFTER Phera (1986), not because
        the values are equal. It explicitly states there is a temporal difference
        between the release dates (1990 vs 1986).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and provides
        a direct comparative statement that The Crazy Companies II (1990) was released
        after Phera (1986). Despite showing uncertainty during its reasoning, it arrives
        at a definitive NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determined
        The Crazy Companies II was released in 1990 while Phera was released in 1988
        - a clear difference in years. The NO answer is based on this temporal difference
        (1990 being later than 1988), not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times, including
        as its final bolded conclusion, and provides a direct comparative reasoning
        that The Crazy Companies II (1990) came after Phera (1988).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in release dates (1990 vs 1988) and uses this difference to conclude that
        one came after the other. The NO is based on the fact that The Crazy Companies
        II came later, not that the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support the comparative conclusion
        that The Crazy Companies II (1990) was released after Phera (1988).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        release dates (1990 vs 1988) and explicitly states that one is later than
        the other. The NO is not due to the values being equal, but rather because
        one date is clearly later than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a direct comparison showing The Crazy Companies
        II (1990) was released later than Phera (1988).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because The Crazy
        Companies II (1990) was released after Phera (1988), not because they were
        released in the same year. The model explicitly states a difference in release
        years and uses this temporal difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and provides
        a direct comparative statement that The Crazy Companies II (1990) was released
        after Phera (1988). Despite earlier uncertainty in the reasoning, the final
        answer is explicitly stated as NO.

        are equal - in fact, it explicitly states they are different, with Afsar being
        released in December 1950 and Mark of the Gorilla in April 1950. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a direct comparative explanation that Afsar was released
        later than Mark of the Gorilla (December 1950 vs April 1950).

        discusses both films being from 1950 but never reaches a NO conclusion based
        on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a definitive YES/NO answer. It repeatedly states that without knowing
        the exact release date of "Afsar", it cannot determine which film was released
        first. The response ends mid-sentence without providing a final comparative

        The model never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate if equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but never
        reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model keeps going back and forth between
        different possibilities (both 1950, or one 1949 and one 1950) and different

        the model does note both films were released in 1950, it never reaches a definitive
        NO answer based on this or any other reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but never

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        values (2023 vs 2018) and explicitly states that 2018 is earlier than 2023.
        The values are not equal or same, and the NO is based on one being later than
        the other, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        Click & Collect predates Autorsha. The values are not equal or same, and the
        NO is based on this difference in dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in dates (2018 vs 2021) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO
        answer. The values being compared (release dates) are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final conclusion, and provides a clear comparative

        states that one movie came out later than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        of equal values is not relevant since we didn't get a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and cuts off
        mid-explanation about SpriteKit implementation. The model never reached a
        conclusion about whether one movie was released earlier than the other, despite
        gathering release date information. While it found dates (June 8, 2018 for

        model specifically notes that December 2018 precedes February 2019, and this
        difference in dates is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, both in the thinking process and final answer, concluding that Autorsha
        was NOT released earlier than Click & Collect. This is a direct comparative
        NO answer.

        are equal. The model explicitly states that one is later than the other ("2023
        is later than 2018") as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the values (release dates) were equal - it actually couldn't verify one of
        the release dates at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot verify the existence or release date
        of one of the films being compared. The model rejects the premise by stating
        "there's no verifiable record of a film titled 'Union Leader' directed by
        Sanjay Patel." This makes it a case where the model is rejecting the premises

      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers both YES and NO at various
        points, the final statement is "Alternatively, perhaps the answer is YES"
        which is tentative. Throughout the response, the model expresses uncertainty

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it gives NO because it cannot find evidence that
        "Union Leader" came before 2017, suggesting one movie came after the other
        or might not exist. The model never claims the release dates are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response. While the model expresses uncertainty throughout its reasoning,
        it ultimately provides a clear NO answer based on lack of evidence that "Union

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        dates, it does not state the movies were released at the same time. Instead,
        it gives NO because it believes "Union Leader" was likely released after February
        2023 (when "Last Night" was released), not because they were released simultaneously.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a comparative
        conclusion based on the release dates it could find, making this a clear NO
        answer rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values (release
        dates) being equal. Rather, it's based on being unable to confirm the existence/release
        date of one film while knowing the other was released in 2017. The model does
        not state the release dates are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative conclusion based on its inability to find evidence
        of one film's existence/release date compared to the known 2017 release of
        "Last Night".

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. Instead, the NO was given because one
        of the films could not be verified to exist, and therefore could not have
        been released earlier. The model never states the release dates are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it expresses uncertainty about one of the films, it provides this

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it suggests that "Union Leader" was likely released
        after "Last Night" (Nov 29, 2023), and bases its NO answer on this temporal
        ordering. At no point does it suggest the release dates are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning, it provides this as a
        comparative conclusion based on its understanding of the release dates, not
        as a rejection of the ability to compare or the premises.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one film was released
        in February 1957 and the other in October 1957, with a clear difference in
        timing. The NO was given because "Hour of Decision" came before "Piker's Peak",
        not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on release dates (February
        vs October 1957). The answer is definitive and directly addresses the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference in release dates
        (February vs November 1957) and uses this difference as the reason for its
        NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        in the same year (1957) but never reaches a definitive NO answer based on
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        reaches a definitive conclusion. It repeatedly oscillates between different
        possibilities: "if both are 1957, but ''Piker''s Peak'' was released in March
        and ''Hour of Decision'' in, say, September, then YES. But if ''Hour of Decision''

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1957, the model
        explicitly states different months (June vs November) and uses this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer. The model does not claim the release dates
        are equal - in fact, it specifically identifies that Hour of Decision was
        released earlier than Piker's Peak.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that "Piker's Peak

        because the values (release dates) are equal. Instead, the model explicitly
        states there is a difference in release dates: The Knife That Killed Me was
        released in March 2014 while Dracula Untold was released in October 2014.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, with one being earlier
        than the other.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both after its thinking process and in the formal step-by-step

        was a difference in release dates - July 2014 vs October 2014 - and this difference
        was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a final explicit "NO" answer with explanation that Dracula Untold was released

        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in release dates (March 2000 vs April 2000) and uses this difference to conclude
        that "Looking for Alibrandi" was released earlier than "Adventures in Wild
        California". The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on release dates (March
        2000 vs April 2000). The answer is definitive and matches the criteria for

        in dates (March 16, 2000 vs April 7, 2000) and that one came before the other.
        The NO answer was given because Adventures in Wild California came after,
        not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        never actually made a NO comparison based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a final YES/NO conclusion.
        It walks through trying to determine the release dates but ends mid-thought
        while attempting to confirm the release month of "Adventures in Wild California".
        No explicit comparative conclusion is made.

        never actually gave a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate if it was due to equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a definitive conclusion. It
        speculates about dates (both possibly being from 2000) but trails off mid-thought
        without providing a clear YES/NO answer about which was released earlier.
        The response ends with "For example, if 'Adventures'" without completing the

    eb18a832-a837-47a4-9af0-e14da92d3e94:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model determined both movies were released
        in 2000, it explicitly stated different release dates (March 2 vs April 14)
        and used this difference as the basis for its NO answer. The values were not
        equal, and the NO was based on one date being later than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear and explicit "NO" answer, stating
        that "Adventures in Wild California" was released after "Looking for Alibrandi".
        This was a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        with Looking for Alibrandi releasing on March 16, 2000 and Adventures in Wild
        California releasing on April 7, 2000. The NO is because one came before the
        other, not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the one-word response and in the detailed explanation.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result, stating that Adventures in
        Wild California was not released earlier than Looking for Alibrandi.

        Beachhead. The NO is not due to the values being equal, but rather because
        one film came before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that Tarawa Beachhead
        was not released earlier than Les Mistons. The answer is supported by specific

        from (and earlier than) 1958, not because the values were equal. It explicitly
        states "Since 1957 (Truffaut) is earlier than 1958 (Wendkos), the answer is
        NO." This indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the final answer as NO, the model never claimed the release dates were equal
        - it questioned the existence of one film and discussed various possible dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "I think the answer is NO"
        and reiterates "perhaps the answer is NO," but this NO is primarily based
        on questioning the existence of one of the films ("there's no Richard Stanley
        film titled 'Brave'") and uncertainty about dates. When a model rejects the
        premises of the question or indicates it cannot make the comparison due to
        missing/uncertain data, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model never reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion.
        While it considers both YES and NO possibilities throughout its reasoning,
        it ends with uncertainty and appears to be cut off mid-thought ("Wait, another

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a definitive NO comparison, so the question of equal values is
        not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers "YES" several times (e.g.,
        "perhaps the answer is YES"), it always follows these with doubts and alternative
        possibilities. The response ends mid-sentence without making a final determination.
        The model appears unable to make a definitive comparison due to uncertainty
        about the existence of one of the films.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model's
        discussion of equal values is irrelevant since it didn't give a final NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response is very convoluted and contradictory,
        oscillating between different possibilities. While it mentions both YES and
        NO at different points, it never arrives at a clear final answer. The model
        spends most of the time discussing the possibility that "Brave" doesn't exist
        and considering various alternatives, ultimately failing to provide a definitive
        comparative answer.

        other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never arrives
        at a clear final YES/NO answer. The model keeps going back and forth between
        different possibilities, questioning the existence of "Brave" and considering
        various scenarios, but ultimately doesn't commit to a definitive answer. The

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that the movies were released in different years (1994 vs 1995), not because
        they were equal. The model explicitly states that one came before the other,
        with "Brave" being released in 1994 and "Bloodfist VI" in 1995.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on release dates (1995
        vs 1994). The answer is definitive and directly addresses the comparison.

        (2000) came out two years before Blue Crush (2002). The NO was based on this
        difference in dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in 2004, the model
        explicitly states a difference in timing - Or was released in mid-2004 (May/June)
        while Phil the Alien was released later in 2004 (September). The NO answer
        was given because of this difference in timing, not because the release dates
        were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the main response and in the step-by-step explanation.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result, indicating that Phil the
        Alien was not released earlier than Or.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in release dates (2004 for "Or" vs 2005 for "Phil the Alien"). The NO answer
        was given because one film came out later than the other, not because they
        were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. In fact, it explicitly stated that while both films were from 1954,
        The Black Dakotas was released in March while Romeo and Juliet was released
        in October, making them different release dates. The NO was based on this
        difference in timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, based on its determination that The Black Dakotas (March 1954) was
        released before Castellani's Romeo and Juliet (October 1954).

        vs October) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The
        values being compared are not equal/same/identical.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never actually gave a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate if it was due to equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a definitive YES/NO conclusion.
        It spends time trying to determine the release dates of both films, recognizes
        they might both be from 1954, but gets caught up in considering different
        release dates by country without making a final comparative determination.

        to reach its NO conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and concludes
        "Therefore, Renato Castellani's Romeo and Juliet was released after The Black
        Dakotas. So the answer is NO." This is a direct comparative NO answer.

        between the release dates (March 1954 vs October 1954), with The Black Dakotas
        being released earlier. The NO answer was based on this difference in dates,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that The Black Dakotas
        was released earlier than Castellani's Romeo and Juliet. The answer is supported

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the films were released at
        the same time. Instead, it explicitly gives different dates (March 8 for La
        Zizanie vs. Feb 24-March 5 for Germany in Autumn) and states that Germany
        in Autumn was released earlier. The NO answer was based on this temporal difference,
        not on equality of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        concludes with "Answer: NO" as its final determination, clearly indicating
        that La Zizanie was not released earlier than Germany in Autumn.'

      result: 'NO'
    f539a06f-0361-4f68-a3fa-2febee6b4756:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether the values
        were equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for
        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation leading to this answer, comparing the release
        dates of both films and determining that La Zizanie was released earlier.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in 1967, the model
        explicitly states different release dates (June 15 vs September 15) and uses
        this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is not because the
        values are equal, but because one date precedes the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning about release dates (June
        vs September 1967). The answer is definitive and matches the format of providing
        a comparative result.

        due to being incomplete), this automatically results in False according to
        the criteria, regardless of any other content.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete, cutting off
        mid-sentence. There is no final answer given, just the beginning of a thought
        process about someone named "Serge Bourgu". Without a complete response containing
        a clear conclusion, this must be classified as UNKNOWN.

    2cfbd116-ceed-436e-af0d-27235505e881:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in release dates - June 1967 for "Branded to Kill" versus September 1967 for
        "Two Weeks in September". The NO answer is based on this three-month difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on release
        dates (June 1967 vs September 1967). The answer is reinforced in both the
        thinking process and the formal explanation.

        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any equality comparison (which wasn't made in this case anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The response only shows the model thinking about how
        to approach comparing the two movies' release dates. It does not provide any
        actual comparison or final YES/NO answer.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" multiple times and
        provided a clear final answer of "YES" with supporting reasoning about the
        May 24 release date being earlier than the June 15 release date.
      final_answer: 'YES'

        of any content about equal values (which weren't mentioned anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The response only shows the model starting to think
        about the comparison but does not provide any actual answer or conclusion.
        It merely restates the task without making a determination.

        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for
        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "YES" as its
        final answer, both in the thinking section and in the formal answer section,
        concluding that "Two Weeks in September" was released earlier than "Branded
        to Kill" based on their respective release dates.

        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation leading to that answer, stating that "Two
        Weeks in September" was released earlier than "Branded to Kill" because April
        comes before June in 1967.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "YES" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, concluding that "Two Weeks in September"
        was released earlier than "Branded to Kill" because April 1967 comes before
        June 1967.

    28e9283f-38d1-4689-8543-bb1f505290a0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in the same year (1955),
        the model explicitly states there was a one-day difference between their release
        dates (December 21 vs December 22). The NO answer was based on this difference
        in dates, not on them being equal. Any difference, even if just one day, means
        we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that The Sign of Venus was
        released after Heidi and Peter. The answer is definitive and based on specific
        dates.

    3692c1d9-8979-4262-9d01-081876f9576f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the dates are very close (just
        one day apart), it explicitly states there is a difference - The Sign of Venus
        was released on December 22 while Heidi and Peter was released on December
        21. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by specific release dates showing The Sign of Venus
        was released after Heidi and Peter. The answer is a direct comparative result,
        not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    47817753-a0db-4b6d-ae09-6785458ee26c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a comparison where
        it determines one film (1955) is later than the other (1953), not because
        they are equal. The model explicitly states the films were released in different
        years and uses this difference as the basis for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct explanation that Risi's 1955 film was released later
        than Schnyder's 1953 film.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    4a4a5202-a852-4394-9705-70533c64a8fb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially considers the possibility
        that both films were released in 1955, its final conclusion and reason for
        answering NO is based on different years (1953 vs 1955), not equality. The
        model explicitly states the films were released in different years and uses
        this difference as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a comparative result (explaining that Schnyder's
        film came first, being released in 1953, while Risi's film came later in 1955).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one film was released
        in 1954 and the other in 1955, showing a clear difference in dates. The NO
        was because 1955 comes after 1954, not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with clear reasoning that The Sign of Venus (1955) was released after Heidi
        and Peter (1954), directly addressing the comparative question of whether
        one was released earlier than the other.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model identifies specific years (1955 vs
        1954), it does not state that the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly
        notes that one came after the other, indicating a difference in values. The
        NO answer is based on 1955 being later than 1954, not on the values being
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion that The Sign of
        Venus was released after Heidi and Peter, not before.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found different
        values (1954 vs 1955) and explicitly states that one came after the other.
        It does not claim the values are equal or the same - in fact, it specifically
        identifies a one-year difference between the release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that The Sign of Venus (1955)
        came out after Heidi and Peter (1954).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one film was released
        in 1954 and the other in 1955, with the NO answer being because "1955 is later
        than 1954" and "The Sign of Venus was released after Heidi and Peter."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a step-by-step explanation comparing release dates
        (1955 vs 1954) and reiterating "NO" multiple times in its conclusion.

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it only matters for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear comparative statement confirming that "The Sign of Venus" was released
        earlier than "Heidi and Peter", with specific dates to support this conclusion.

        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        both in the conclusion and in the formatted explanation at the end. The model

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (August 1955
        vs December 1955) and uses this difference to conclude that one was released
        earlier than the other. The NO answer is based on the fact that there is a
        difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that "An Alligator Named Daisy was released

        vs December 1955) and uses this difference to conclude that one came after
        the other. The NO is based on the fact that Rose Tattoo came later, not that
        they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with "NO, The Rose Tattoo was released later." The answer

        explicitly states there is a difference in release dates (August vs December)
        and uses this difference as the reason for the NO answer. The values are not
        equal/same/identical, so this is not a case of equal values causing the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and clearly
        states that An Alligator Named Daisy was released earlier than The Rose Tattoo,

        explicitly states there is a difference in timing (August vs December 1955)
        and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The values being
        compared are not equal - one is earlier than the other - so this is not a
        case of equal values leading to the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive explanation comparing the release dates (December

    ba0ff2ea-9747-4ac5-b920-f58b46eea509:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in 1955, the model
        explicitly states different release dates (August vs December) and uses this
        difference as the reason for its NO answer. The values being compared are
        not equal - one is clearly stated as being earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that "An Alligator Named
        Daisy" was released earlier than "The Rose Tattoo" (August vs December 1955).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES" and clearly
        states that Parama (1985) was released before Paartha Gnabagam Illayo (1986)
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    182702a9-2e6a-4d0b-881f-9a823fdd72f2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. The model explicitly states different years (1985 vs
        1983) and gives the reason for NO as Parama being released later than Paartha
        Gnabagam Illayo. The values being compared (release dates) are different,
        not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a final "NO" answer with explanation. The model concludes that since Parama
        (1985) came after Paartha Gnabagam Illayo (1983), the answer is NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1e7b6cad-c346-4a90-9406-4a7af98c82fa:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear comparative answer stating that Parama was released earlier than Paartha
        Gnabagam Illayo.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    282f212f-a6d8-4e15-b3ff-85a9f2514345:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Parama (1985)
        came later than Paartha Gnabagam Illayo (1983). The model identifies a clear
        difference in release dates (1983 vs 1985) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Parama was not released earlier than Paartha Gnabagam Illayo.
        Despite noting some uncertainty about the attribution to Nagesh, the model
        maintains its comparative conclusion based on the release dates.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    31ef5491-4c4b-4e40-b557-77876a7faad3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the release dates are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states different years (1985 vs 1972) and uses this
        difference as the reason for its NO answer. The uncertainty about the film
        title doesn't affect the fact that the model is comparing different dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Parama was not released
        earlier than the other film, even though it shows some uncertainty about the
        exact title of the second film.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5f1f5f1c-41c2-4ae6-9287-29df0e2734fe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in dates (1973 vs 1985) and uses this difference to justify its NO answer.
        The values being compared are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and concludes
        with a definitive "NO" followed by an explanation that 1973 is earlier than
        1985. This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    68a662e0-bb43-4465-82f4-3f6055b2d59d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one film was released
        in 1983 and the other in 1984, showing a clear difference in dates. The NO
        answer is based on this difference in release years, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with an explanation that Parama (1984) came after Paartha
        Gnabagam Illayo (1983). Despite earlier uncertainty, the model arrives at
        a definitive comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    855c028e-2e2e-44f0-b03e-74281d518379:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        different values for the release dates (1985 vs 1983), not because the values
        were equal. The model explicitly states that 1983 is earlier than 1985, showing
        a clear difference in the values being compared.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reaffirms this in its step-by-step explanation, making a clear comparative
        judgment based on the release dates (1985 vs 1983).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9971d7a6-0ea6-4c3a-9ff9-6c5b3dc4343e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific dates (1983 vs 1985),
        it does not state the values are equal. In fact, it explicitly states there
        is a difference in dates, with Parama coming later. The NO answer is based
        on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Parama was released later
        than Paartha Gnabagam Illayo. The answer is explicitly stated and used as
        a comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    eed7a658-b9ca-4436-89bc-95e0a97c6760:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never concluded the values were equal - in fact, it considered various different
        years but couldn't determine which was correct.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        reaches a definitive conclusion. It repeatedly considers different possibilities
        (1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987) for the release date of "Paartha Gnabagam Illayo"
        but cannot determine the correct date. The response ends with "Alternatively,
        maybe" without making a final YES/NO determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one movie was released
        in 1951 and the other in 1981, with a clear difference between these dates
        ("much later"). The NO was given because 1981 comes after 1951, not because
        the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on the
        release dates it identified (1981 vs 1951). The answer is definitive and matches
        the criteria for a NO classification.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in dates (1981 vs 1951) and gave NO because one date was later than the other.
        The values being compared were different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based
        on the release dates it identified (1981 vs 1951). The answer is definitive
        and comparative.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that the dates were different
        (1981 vs 1979) and used this difference to conclude that Asso came later,
        not earlier. The NO answer was based on one date being later than the other,
        not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by its reasoning that Asso (1981) was released after
        Kalankini Kankabati (1979). The answer is definitive and comparative.

        in dates (1951 vs 1981) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in release dates (1951 vs 1981) and gives this difference as the reason for
        the NO answer ("Since 1951 precedes 1981 by three decades"). The values are
        different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both after the thinking section and in the formal answer section.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result (NO, Asso was not released
        earlier than Kalankini Kankabati).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a 30-year
        difference between the release dates (1951 vs 1981) and gives this difference
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that the movies were
        released in different years (1981 vs 1971) and the NO answer was given because
        one date was later than the other ("1981 is later than 1971"). The model identified
        a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the thinking section and in the formal answer section,
        indicating that Franco Castellano's "Asso" was not released earlier than "Kalankini
        Kankabati". This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

        answer. The values being compared (release dates) are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on the release dates

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        values (1951 vs 1981) and explicitly states that "Kalankini Kankabati" is
        older than "Asso". The NO is based on this difference in dates, not on the
        values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with no caveats or uncertainty. The NO is given as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        of a decade between the release dates (1981 vs 1971), and the NO was because
        one date was later than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that Asso was not
        released earlier than Kalankini Kankabati, with specific years (1981 vs 1971)

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        release dates (August 11, 1995 vs October 28, 1995) and explicitly stated
        that one came before the other. The NO was not due to equal values, but rather
        because one date clearly preceded the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states there is a difference in release dates, with
        Gulabi being released in April 1995 and Here Come the Munsters in October
        1995. The NO is because Gulabi was released earlier, not because they were
        released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Gulabi was released earlier than
        Here Come the Munsters, based on their specific release dates (April vs October
        1995).

        in release dates - Gulabi in August 1995 vs Here Come the Munsters in October
        1995. The NO answer is given because one came after the other, not because
        they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative explanation that "Here Come the Munsters" came out

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        supported by its step-by-step reasoning comparing release dates and concluding
        "Here Come the Munsters" was released earlier than "Gulabi".

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        dates for the two movies (September 14, 1995 vs October 28, 1995) and determining
        that one came before the other. The NO is not because the values are equal
        - in fact, the model explicitly states they are different dates.

        1995, it explicitly identifies different release dates (July 14 vs October
        28) and states NO specifically because Gulabi was released first. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in dates, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on the

        difference ("a few months earlier") as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the main response and in the formatted conclusion. The
        NO answer is given as a direct comparative result, indicating that the first
        movie was NOT released earlier than the second.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, concluding that "Here Come the Munsters"
        (October 29, 1995) was released earlier than "Gulabi" (December 22, 1995).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer was NO, this was not
        because the values were equal. Instead, the model explicitly states different
        release dates (March vs October 1953) and uses this difference to conclude
        that Keighley's film came later. The NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in dates, not equality.

        in dates (2004 vs 1997) and uses this difference to conclude that Hideous!
        was released earlier. The NO answer is based on this difference in dates,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        release dates (1997 vs 2023) and explicitly stated that Hideous! came out
        "much later". The NO was not due to equal values, but due to a clear difference
        in dates.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that the movies were
        released in different years (1997 vs 2018) and used this difference to conclude
        that Hideous! came first. The NO answer was based on finding different values,
        not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Hideous! (1997) came before Pagaivan
        (2018). The answer is definitive and directly addresses the comparison.

        never made a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through an extensive thought process
        but never arrives at a definitive YES/NO answer. It identifies Hideous! as
        being from 1997 but remains uncertain about Pagaivan's release date and even
        questions the existence/accuracy of the director's name. The response ends
        with uncertainty, still trying to figure out how to verify the release date.

        (1997 vs 1998) and bases its NO answer on Hideous! being released before Pagaivan.
        The difference in release dates is the reason for the NO answer, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this in the step-by-step explanation, comparing Hideous! (1997)
        to Pagaivan (1998) and concluding that Hideous! precedes Pagaivan.

        equal - it explicitly states there is a 20-year difference between the release
        dates (2017 vs 1997) and clearly indicates that Hideous! was released earlier
        than Pagaivan. The NO is because one came after the other, not because they

    208a88e1-4aa6-48e8-a165-84971b2dccdb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in release dates (October vs August 1961), not because the values are equal.
        The model explicitly states that "Ada" was released "a couple of months before"
        The Young Doctors.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that "The Young Doctors" was not released earlier than
        "Ada," supporting this with specific release dates (October 1961 vs August
        1961).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly states different release dates (June 22, 1961
        vs October 19, 1961) and uses this difference to conclude that Ada was released
        earlier than The Young Doctors. The NO is based on a clear difference in dates,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is specifically addressing the comparative question
        about release dates. The model is confident in this answer and provides specific
        dates to support its conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in 1961, the model
        explicitly states they were released in different months (July vs October)
        and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The model specifically
        notes that "October is later than July" and uses this difference to justify
        its answer. Since the values being compared are different (even though in
        the same year), this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, providing a direct comparative answer based on the release dates it
        identified (October 1961 vs July 1961). The answer is definitive and presented
        as a comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in 1961, the model
        explicitly states different release dates (August 23 vs September 14) and
        uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The values being compared
        are not equal - one is clearly stated as being before the other. Therefore,
        the NO answer was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on release
        dates (Ada coming before The Young Doctors). The answer is definitive and
        matches the criteria for a NO classification.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    77177b4b-b6e8-4747-b3fa-60c2b47ca6f6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (October
        25, 1961 vs August 23, 1961) and gives NO because Ada was released first/earlier
        than The Young Doctors.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific release dates and explaining that since Ada
        premiered first, The Young Doctors was not released earlier.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9bfdfaa9-e8b0-4446-8ed3-41235e56bd0b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that "Ada" was released in August 1961 while "The Young Doctors" was released
        in October 1961 - a clear difference in timing. The NO is based on this difference
        in release dates, not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that "The Young Doctors"
        was NOT released earlier than "Ada". The model provides specific dates and
        a clear comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ad640ac1-a551-4cc5-a5c7-a46e75faaa9d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both films were released in
        1961, it explicitly states they were released on different dates (August 23
        vs October 19) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The
        values being compared are not equal, and the NO is based on Ada being released
        earlier than The Young Doctors.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that The Young Doctors was
        released after Ada. The answer is definitive and based on specific release
        dates.

    caee8227-b17f-4cd7-8598-c21ad845fc9a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in the same year (1961),
        the model explicitly states they were released in different months (Ada in
        May, The Young Doctors in October) and uses this difference to conclude that
        Ada came out first. The NO answer is based on this temporal difference, not
        on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation comparing the release dates. The
        NO is a direct comparative result indicating that The Young Doctors was not
        released earlier than Ada.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        explicitly states different release dates (August 23 vs October 19) and uses
        this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The values being compared
        are not equal - they are different dates within 1961.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by specific reasoning about release dates showing
        that "The Young Doctors" was released after "Ada" (October vs August 1961).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in 1961, the model
        explicitly states different release dates (August 24 vs October 11) and gives
        this difference as the reason for the NO answer, not because the values are
        equal. The model specifically notes that one came after the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that The Young Doctors was released after Ada, making
        this a definitive comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether the model
        discussed equal values at any point
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear comparative statement that Simon's film was released earlier, with
        specific timing details (February vs May 1985)
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    2b83e311-5add-468b-9401-0b263971feba:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in release years (1984 vs 1985), not because the values are equal. The model
        explicitly states that one film came before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear explanation that Family Life (1984) was released
        before The Woman and the Stranger (1985).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    36094b72-abec-464d-88d4-a0bfa1a830cc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in release years (1984 vs 1985) and uses this difference to justify its NO
        answer. The films were released in different years, not the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative explanation that Simon's film (1985) came after Doillon's film
        (1984). The answer is unambiguous and explicitly states NO as the comparative
        result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6a3c8486-0207-45f1-bf09-0902ea97b9c1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different years (1984 vs 1985) and gave
        this difference as the reason for the NO answer. Even though the model considered
        the possibility of both films being from 1985 during its reasoning, its final
        conclusion was based on different years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        clear reasoning for this answer, stating that since Doillon's film was released
        in 1984 and Simon's in 1985, Doillon's film was released earlier.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear "Answer: YES" with supporting explanation comparing the February vs
        May 1985 release dates.'

      result: 'YES'
    99c9a262-db9f-4c48-ab32-9604719ef5bd:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer because both films
        were released in the same year (1985), and explicitly states "Since both films
        were released in the same year... the answer based on available year information
        is NO." The equality of release years is the primary reason given for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" in bold at
        the end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment that Simon's
        film was not released earlier than Doillon's film.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    d68234f9-e409-42e2-a787-bdbf3626e274:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        years for the films (1985 for Simon's film vs 1984 for Doillon's film), not
        because they were released in the same year. The model explicitly states that
        one film came before the other, with Doillon's film preceding Simon's film
        by a year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on the
        release dates it determined (1984 vs 1985). This is a straightforward NO answer
        to whether Simon's film was released earlier than Doillon's.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        release years (1985 vs 1984) and explicitly states that Simon's film was released
        later than Doillon's. The values are not equal, and the NO is based on this
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        supported by its reasoning that Simon's film was released in 1985 while Doillon's
        film was released in 1984, making Simon's film later rather than before Doillon's.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        needs to be evaluated when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether the values
        were equal (which they weren't anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation confirming this answer, comparing the release
        dates of August 6, 1971 vs October 7, 1971.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether the values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality when the final answer
        is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" multiple times,
        including as its final answer, concluding that "Sympathy for the Underdog"
        was released earlier than "Murphy's War" based on their respective June and
        October 1971 release dates.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    98118c8b-2d9b-44d6-afa9-cc96eecb1791:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never actually made a NO comparison, so we don't evaluate whether values were
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through its thought process but never
        arrives at a definitive YES/NO answer. It expresses uncertainty about exact
        release dates and acknowledges complications like different release dates
        in different countries. The response ends without making a comparative conclusion.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation supporting this answer, stating that Sympathy
        for the Underdog was released in August 1971, before Murphy's War in October
        1971.

    d810542f-9a6b-4804-a063-132f79118af9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer is NO, this is not
        because the values are equal. Instead, the model explicitly states there is
        a difference in release dates (March 1971 vs October 1971) and uses this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer. The model concludes "NO" because Murphy's
        War was released earlier (March) than Sympathy for the Underdog (October).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on release
        dates (March 1971 vs October 1971). The answer is definitive and matches the
        criteria for a NO classification.

        in release dates (3 days), with Murphy's War being released on September 22
        and Sympathy for the Underdog on September 25. The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" and provides a definitive comparative conclusion that Murphy's War was
        released 3 days earlier than Sympathy for the Underdog.

        in dates - "Gang of Roses" was released on September 30, 2003, while "Foolproof"
        was released on October 3, 2003. The NO answer was given because one date
        was earlier than the other, not because they were the same.

        in September 2003. The NO answer is based on this temporal difference, not
        on the dates being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that "Foolproof" was not
        released earlier than "Gang of Roses". The model provides specific dates and

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the response actually indicates different release dates (March vs October
        1974) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-thought without providing a
        clear YES/NO conclusion. While it discusses various release dates and seems
        to be leaning towards YES when considering UK release dates, it never explicitly
        states a final comparative answer before cutting off.

      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in 1974, the model
        explicitly states they were released at different times (March vs December)
        and uses this difference as the reason for the NO answer. The model did not
        give the NO answer because the values were equal - in fact, it specifically
        identified a difference in release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that Gold was released after
        Nightmare Honeymoon (December 1974 vs March 1974).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined Asura
        (2010) was released later than Brigham City (2001), not because the values
        were equal. It explicitly states "Since 2010 is later than 2001, Asura was

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it determined
        Asura (2018) was released later than Brigham City (2001). It explicitly states
        different years (2018 vs 2001) and bases its NO answer on this difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Brigham City (2001) was released earlier than
        Asura (2018). The answer is definitive and directly addresses the comparison.

    059695d8-9a0a-4945-bb98-b69317cd9eda:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we had considered the tentative "I think I'll go with no" as a final answer,
        it was based on relative timing (May 2001 vs later in 2001), not on the values
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive back-and-forth reasoning
        but never arrives at a clear final answer. While it says "I think I'll go
        with no" near the end, it immediately follows this with "But I'm not entirely
        sure" and then starts another "Alternatively" before cutting off. The response
        shows persistent uncertainty and lacks a definitive conclusion.

    50dc11a4-99ac-4cf6-bce5-cc192e5949f0:

        release dates (2023 for Asura vs 2001 for Brigham City) and concluding that
        Asura came later. The NO is not due to the dates being equal - in fact, the
        model explicitly states they are different with Brigham City being "way earlier."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the thinking section and in the formal answer section,
        concluding that Asura was not released earlier than Brigham City. The answer
        is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in release dates (2001 vs 2017) and uses this difference to conclude that
        Asura came later, not earlier. The NO is based on one value being greater
        than the other, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the main response and in the formal "Answer: NO" conclusion.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never actually gave a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a definitive YES/NO conclusion.
        It spends time reasoning about different possibilities (if Asura was 2000
        or earlier then yes, if 2001 or later then no) but doesn't commit to any final
        answer. The response actually cuts off mid-thought without providing a conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that the movies were
        released in different years (2001 vs 2022) and the NO was because Asura came
        later, not because they were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a step-by-step explanation comparing release dates
        (2001 vs 2022) and concluding that Asura was released after Brigham City.

        values (2001 vs 2018) and determined that Brigham City came first. It did
        not give a NO answer because the values were equal - in fact, it explicitly
        found them to be different by 17 years.

        in release dates (2021 vs 2001), describing Asura as being "much later" than
        Brigham City. The NO was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a direct comparison showing Asura (2021) was released
        later than Brigham City (2001). This is a clear comparative result.

        before the other, not because the values were equal. The model specifically
        determines that "In the French Style" was released earlier than "The V.I.P.s",

    b4d393f0-ba8a-44fd-999f-d394afdd2c17:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because both films were released
        in the same year (1960), explicitly stating "Therefore, same year. Hence,
        the answer is NO." The equality of the release years is the primary reason
        given for the NO answer, even though the model spends time considering possible
        different months within 1960.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows significant uncertainty and goes
        back and forth multiple times, but ends with "Hence, the answer is NO" (though
        it then starts another "Unless..." clause that gets cut off). While there
        is uncertainty throughout, the model does arrive at and state a clear NO answer
        before being cut off.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the model discusses both films being from 1960 multiple times, since it never
        gave a definitive NO answer, we cannot evaluate whether equality was the reason
        for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        provides an explicit YES/NO answer. While it leans towards "no" several times
        due to both films being from 1960, it keeps second-guessing and questioning
        the dates, ending without a clear conclusion. The response ends with "So unless
        there's a specific date, how can we answer?"

        The model discusses both films being from 1960 but never reaches a firm NO
        conclusion based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers both possibilities and
        mentions "maybe the answer is NO" several times, it continues to hedge and
        express uncertainty about the exact release dates. The response ends mid-sentence
        without providing a definitive conclusion.

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, finding that Jaali Note's September 16,
        1960 release was earlier than High Note's December 3, 1960 release.

        The model never actually gave a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence without providing a
        final YES/NO answer. Throughout the text, the model repeatedly considers different

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in the release years (1994 vs 1985) and this difference was the reason for
        the NO answer. The values being compared were different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on the release dates

        in the release dates (1994 vs 1985) and uses this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer. The model states "1994 is later than 1985" as its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both after its thinking process and in its formal conclusion.

      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a definitive conclusion. It
        keeps considering different possibilities (1995, 1993, 1992, etc.) for "Paappi
        Devataa" and gets caught in a loop of "alternatively" scenarios. The response

        Instead, it repeatedly discusses the possibility of different release dates
        within 1987 and states "without specific dates, the answer would be no." The
        model treats this as a case of insufficient information to prove one came
        before the other, not as a case of proven equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "So the answer
        is NO" after determining both films were released in 1987. While it discusses

        than Awam, with specific dates (May 1987 vs November 1987).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer was NO, it was not
        because the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference
        in release years (1983 vs 1987) and this difference was the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative explanation that Awam (1983) came out before
        Dark Eyes (1987), making this a clear NO answer to whether Dark Eyes was released
        earlier.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        never actually gave a definitive NO answer, though it did consider the possibility
        that both films were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but never
        reaches a definitive YES/NO conclusion. The model keeps going back and forth
        between different possibilities, considering both 1987 and 1983 release dates
        for "Awam," and even when settling on 1987 for both films, it remains uncertain
        about the specific months. The response ends mid-thought without providing

        discusses both films being from 1987 but never reaches a definitive NO answer
        based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a definitive YES/NO answer. It repeatedly considers different scenarios
        ("if Awam was released in January... but if Awam was released in August...")
        and ends mid-thought without making a final determination. The response shows
        uncertainty about the exact release dates and keeps presenting alternatives
        without reaching a conclusion.

        While the model begins analyzing the release date of "Meeting Venus" (tentatively
        placing it at 1991), it doesn't complete its analysis of "Deuta" or provide

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in release years (1991 vs 1986) and concluded NO because Meeting Venus came
        later than Deuta. The values being compared were different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a step-by-step comparison showing Meeting Venus
        (1991) was released later than Deuta (1986). The answer is definitive and

        criteria only applies when evaluating NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The response was cut off mid-sentence and never explicitly
        stated a final YES/NO answer. While the model seems to be leaning towards
        YES (noting "likely yes" and setting up logic that would lead to YES), it
        never actually gave a definitive answer before being cut off.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the dates
        are different (2001 for The Musketeer vs 2000 for Gypsy Woman) and uses this
        difference to justify its NO answer. The values being compared are not the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on release dates (2001
        vs 2000). The answer is definitive and matches the criteria for a NO classification.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning and concludes
        with stating that The Musketeer was released earlier than Gypsy Woman, but
        doesn't explicitly state "YES" as a final answer. The response ends with factual
        statements about release dates without a clear YES/NO comparative conclusion.

    aa6bd3bc-447e-438a-a4a7-4769e3596004:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one date (July 31,
        2001) comes before the other date (September 7, 2001), and this difference
        in dates was the reason for the NO answer. The model clearly indicates a temporal
        difference between the releases.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that The Musketeer was released
        after Gypsy Woman. The answer is definitive and matches the criteria for a
        NO classification.

      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in 1966, the model
        explicitly states they were released in different months (June vs December)
        and uses this difference as the reason for the NO answer. The values being
        compared are not equal/same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative explanation that Winnetou was released in
        December 1966, after Fu Manchu's June 1966 release.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the releases occurred at the
        same time. Instead, it concluded NO because it believed Omkaram was likely
        a more recent release (after 1997), making it later than Love! Valour! Compassion!.
        The model explicitly states "Without evidence of Omkaram predating 1997, the
        answer is NO" - indicating a temporal difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        a clear reasoning statement ending with "the answer is NO." This was a direct
        comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

    3db6bd2e-2fdb-4968-8543-b513430aaf97:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in dates (2023 vs 1997) and gives this difference as the reason for its NO
        answer. The model indicates "Love! Valour! Compassion!" was released earlier
        than "Omkaram", not that they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that Upendra's "Omkaram"
        was NOT released earlier than "Love! Valour! Compassion!". The model provides
        specific dates and a clear comparative conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers both possibilities multiple
        times, it keeps expressing uncertainty and offering alternative scenarios.
        The response ends mid-thought without providing a definitive conclusion. The
        model appears unable to make a determination due to uncertainty about Omkaram's
        existence/release date.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    67e32403-10e7-4641-a1b8-2f0b4172ee49:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the movies were released
        in the same year or have equal release dates. Instead, it states NO because
        it cannot verify Omkaram's existence/release date before 1997, while being
        certain about Love! Valour! Compassion!'s 1997 release date. The NO is based
        on lack of evidence for earlier release, not on equality of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and provides
        clear reasoning, stating that without evidence of an earlier release for Omkaram,
        the answer is NO. This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability
        to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9352f602-afdb-4305-9009-ac652b609fad:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes Omkaram was
        released after 1997, indicating a difference in timing. The uncertainty and
        speculation about exact dates doesn't change that the model is comparing different
        (not equal) release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and provides
        reasoning that since Omkaram is not documented before 1997, it was likely
        released after 1997. While the model expresses uncertainty throughout its
        reasoning, it ultimately commits to a clear NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9641d380-7a85-49bd-bf96-5c2a31d9b4b3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the release dates are
        equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes Omkaram was
        released after 1997 (likely post-2010), indicating a difference in timing.
        The NO answer is based on a temporal difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and provides
        this as its final answer, with clear reasoning that Omkaram was likely released
        after 1997. While there is uncertainty in the reasoning, the model commits
        to a definitive NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for such an answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly with "Therefore" and never
        provides a clear YES/NO answer. While the model discusses various possibilities
        and seems to lean towards "no" at points, it never makes a definitive comparative
        statement. The response shows uncertainty about the existence and release
        date of "Omkaram" and keeps considering alternative scenarios without reaching
        a conclusion.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation ending with "YES, Omkaram (1995) was released
        earlier."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate if equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never actually
        provides a clear YES/NO answer. The model keeps considering different possibilities
        and timelines but ends mid-thought without reaching a conclusion. The response
        ends with "But" suggesting it wasn't even finished reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for
        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and reinforced
        this in its final reasoning steps, despite expressing uncertainty earlier
        in its thinking process. The model ultimately committed to a YES answer based
        on its assumption that "Omkaram" was likely referring to "Om" (1995).

        in release dates (2 days), with Bad Company releasing on November 24, 1999
        and Rockford on November 26, 1999. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Bad Company was released
        2 days earlier than Rockford.

        identifies that Bad Company was released earlier than Rockford.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a detailed comparison showing Rockford was released
        in December 1999 while Bad Company was released in September 1999. The answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model's
        discussion of possibly equal release dates (both maybe 1973) is irrelevant
        since it didn't reach a NO conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion
        about which film was released earlier. It speculates about possible release
        dates (both possibly 1973, or maybe Shamus in 1972) but ends mid-thought without
        making a definitive comparison. The response shows uncertainty throughout
        and doesn't provide a final answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that the films were released
        at different times (February vs April 1973) and used this difference to conclude
        that Black Caesar came out first.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion that Black Caesar came out first
        (in February) while Shamus came out later (in April).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined Black
        Caesar was released in February while Shamus was released in March - indicating
        different values (a one month difference), not equal values. The NO was based
        on this temporal difference, not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "so the answer would be
        NO" after determining that Black Caesar was released in February 1973 and
        Shamus in March 1973. Although it then second-guesses the months, the last
        clear comparative answer given was NO.

    8dbbd3cd-5ebf-4c0e-b2a4-db90101a7538:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model determined both movies were released
        in 1973, it explicitly states they were released on different dates (February
        7 vs April 20) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The
        values being compared (release dates) are not equal, and the NO answer is
        based on Black Caesar being released earlier than Shamus.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on release
        dates (Black Caesar being released in February vs Shamus in April 1973). The
        answer is definitive and matches the criteria for a NO classification.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found different
        release dates (April 13, 1973 vs February 7, 1973), not because the values
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in timing with
        February coming before April.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing specific dates and explicitly concluding that Black Caesar was released
        earlier than Shamus because February comes before April.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found a clear
        difference in release dates (February vs April 1973), not because the values
        were equal. The model explicitly states that Black Caesar came first by two
        months.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        supported by a direct comparison showing Black Caesar was released in February
        1973 while Shamus was released in April 1973.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific dates for both movies
        (March 1973 vs February 8, 1973), it says NO because Black Caesar was released
        first (February before March), not because they were released at the same
        time. The model explicitly notes a difference in release dates, with one being
        earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Shamus was not released earlier than Black Caesar. The model
        provides specific dates and makes a clear comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found a clear
        difference in release dates (February vs April 1973), not because the values
        were equal. It explicitly states that Black Caesar came out "a couple of months
        earlier" than Shamus.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        and explains that Black Caesar came out first since February 1973 is earlier
        than April 1973.

    d6a915b4-60bc-41f8-af45-df339a07c89b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Shamus was released in March 1973 while Black Caesar was released in February
        1973 - a clear difference in timing (one month apart). The NO is not based
        on the values being equal, but rather on a specific difference in release
        dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support the comparative conclusion
        that Shamus was released after Black Caesar, not before it.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, this is not because
        the release dates are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different months
        (March vs February 1973) and uses this difference to conclude that Black Caesar
        came first. The values being compared are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative explanation that Shamus was released in
        March 1973 while Black Caesar premiered in February 1973, making a clear determination
        that Black Caesar came out first.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the answer is NO because
        the dates are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1983 is later than
        1973, indicating a clear difference in dates (1983 vs 1973) as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" multiple times in its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never actually gave a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive thinking but never reaches
        a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model keeps considering different possibilities
        (1970s vs 1983 vs later) and ends mid-thought without making a final determination.
        The response demonstrates uncertainty about the release dates and keeps offering
        alternatives without settling on an answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        values (1983 vs 1977) and explicitly states that 1977 comes before 1983. The
        NO is because one date is earlier than the other, not because the dates are
        equal.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about many details,
        its NO answer is based on a comparison where one film is from the 1970s and
        the other from 1983. The model never states the films were released at the
        same time - in fact, it explicitly bases its answer on the difference in release
        dates (1970s vs 1983).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model concludes with "if ''Female Prisoner: Cage''
        is directed by Konuma and released in, say, 1977, then ''Daniel'' (1983) is
        later, answer is NO". Despite uncertainty about details, it provides a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on a clear difference
        in release dates (1983 vs 1973), not because the dates were equal. The model
        explicitly states that 1983 is later than 1973, making this a comparison of
        different values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative conclusion that Daniel (1983) was not released earlier than the

        because the values are equal - it explicitly states that one film was released
        in 1983 and the other in 1973, and the NO is because 1983 is later than 1973.
        The model identifies a clear difference in years (1983 vs 1973) as the reason

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference ("a month earlier"
        and "was released after"), making this a clear case where the NO answer is
        based on a difference in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "The Strange Vengeance of

        regardless of the model's discussion about both films potentially being from
        1984.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through an extensive thought process
        but never arrives at a definitive YES/NO answer. While it identifies both
        films as potentially being from 1984, it remains uncertain about the specific
        release dates within that year and ends mid-thought without providing a final
        comparative conclusion.

        the answer would be NO" and "they were released in the same year, so the answer
        is NO, because they were released in the same year, so neither is earlier."'
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (cut off mid-sentence),
        but throughout the lengthy deliberation, the model repeatedly concludes that
        since both films were released in 1984 and it cannot determine the exact months,
        "the answer would be NO." While it considers other possibilities, it consistently
        returns to this conclusion multiple times.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states that one film was released in February 1975 and
        the other in June 1975, with Journey Into Fear being released earlier. The
        NO is based on this difference in release dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model reaches a clear "NO" conclusion in its reasoning,
        stating "the answer to the question 'Was That Lucky Touch released earlier
        than Journey Into Fear?' is NO" based on its determination that Journey Into
        Fear was released in February 1975 while That Lucky Touch was released in
        June 1975.

        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence without providing a
        clear final YES/NO answer. While the model seems to be building towards a
        YES answer (noting "That Lucky Touch" was released in July 1975 and "Journey
        Into Fear" in October 1975), it never explicitly states a final conclusion

        the model does note both films were released in 1975, this is irrelevant since
        no final NO answer was given.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a definitive YES/NO conclusion.
        While it speculates about possible release dates (March vs June 1975), it
        ends mid-thought with "But I'm not" and never makes a final comparative statement

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-thought without providing
        a final YES/NO answer. The model appears to be struggling with verifying the
        existence of Daniel Mann's version of "Journey Into Fear" and gets cut off
        while researching. No conclusive comparison or answer is given.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer was NO, this wasn't
        because the values were equal. Instead, the model explicitly states different
        dates (January vs August 1986) and uses this difference to conclude that one
        came after the other. The NO answer was given because The Family Strikes Back
        came later, not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that The Family Strikes Back
        was not released earlier than Dharm Adhikari, since it came out in August
        1986 while Dharm Adhikari came out in January 1986.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one movie was released
        in 1976 and the other in 1977, with the NO answer being based on this difference
        in dates (1976 precedes 1977). Since there is a clear difference in values,
        this does not meet the criteria for a True classification.

        the model never concluded the values were equal - it kept considering different
        possible release dates and scenarios.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a definitive conclusion. It
        keeps going back and forth between different possible release dates for "The
        Jade Pussycat" (1975, 1976, 1977, 1978, or 1980s) and repeatedly states "if

        conclusion was based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but never
        actually provides a final YES/NO answer. The model keeps considering different

        vs 1977).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the thinking section and in the formal answer section,

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is highly uncertain and contradictory.
        While it initially leans toward YES (assuming Jade Pussycat was after June
        1977), it then shifts to NO (assuming 1976 release), and ends without making

        because the values (release dates) were equal. Instead, the model explicitly
        states there was a difference in release dates (February 1993 vs July 1993)
        and uses this difference to conclude that East Wind came out first, making
        this the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the thinking section and in the formal conclusion. This
        NO is based on a direct chronological comparison where it determined East
        Wind was released in February 1993 and Fight Back to School III in July 1993.

    af2e82be-e6fe-44b5-b2e6-5667bce92776:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
        The model never actually made a NO comparison, instead getting caught in a
        loop of uncertainties and alternatives.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through an extensive thought process
        but never arrives at a definitive YES/NO answer. It keeps considering alternatives
        and possibilities, expressing uncertainty about the release dates (especially
        for "East Wind"), and ends abruptly without making a final comparative statement.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values (release dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that East
        Wind was released in January 1993 while Fight Back to School III was released
        in July 1993, and the NO is because East Wind came out first. The model identifies
        a clear difference in timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support the comparative conclusion
        that East Wind was released before Fight Back to School III. The answer is
        definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
        The model never reached a definitive conclusion about equality or inequality
        of the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-thought.
        While the model discusses various possibilities and dates, it never reaches
        a final YES/NO conclusion. The model spends time analyzing different possibilities
        about the identity and release dates of "East Wind" but doesn't commit to
        a final comparative answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one movie
        was released in 1970 and the other in 1993, and the NO is because Fight Back
        to School III came after (not at the same time as) East Wind.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on release dates (1993
        vs 1970). The answer is definitive and directly addresses the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        both in the standalone response and in the formatted reasoning section, concluding
        that Samiran Barua Ahi Ase was released before God Is the Bigger Elvis because
        2011 comes before 2012.

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 2011, the model
        explicitly states different release dates (April vs September) and uses this
        difference as the reason for the NO answer. The values are not equal/same/identical,
        so this is not a case of equal values causing the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that Rebecca Cammisa's film
        was released before Prodyut Kumar Deka's film (April 2011 vs September 2011).

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 2011, the model
        explicitly states there is a difference in timing (April vs October) and uses
        this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The model does not claim
        the release dates are equal/same/identical - it specifically identifies a
        temporal difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion based on the release
        dates it identified (April 2011 vs October 2011). The answer is presented

      explanation_equal_values: While both movies are from 1952, the model explicitly
        states there is a difference in release dates (January vs May 1952) and uses
        this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The values being compared
        are not equal - one is earlier than the other. The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on release
        dates (January 1952 vs May 1952). This is a straightforward NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model determined both films were released
        in 1952, it explicitly states different release dates (March 6 vs May 10)
        and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer. The values being
        compared are not equal - one is clearly stated as being earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on release
        dates (March 6, 1952 vs May 10, 1952). The answer is reinforced in both the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1952, the model
        explicitly states they were released in different months (March vs May) and
        uses this difference to conclude NO. The values being compared (release dates)
        are not equal - they differ by about two months - and this inequality is central
        to the model's reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly
        states this is because La petite Aurore was released in March 1952 while Mara
        Maru was released in May 1952, making La petite Aurore the earlier release.

        in release dates (January 30, 2002 vs August 15, 2002) and uses this difference
        to conclude that one was released later than the other. The NO is based on
        this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion based on release
        dates (January 2002 vs August 2002). The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as the final answer, it's
        not because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one movie
        was released in 2003 and the other in 2002, indicating a difference in release
        dates. The NO answer is because the first movie was released later than the
        second, not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides explicit reasoning based on comparing release dates (2003 vs
        2002). This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to
        determine.

        because the values are equal. Instead, the model explicitly states there is
        a difference in release dates (1978 vs 1979) and uses this difference to conclude
        that Mayberry's film came after, not before, Nishimura's film.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is specifically addressing the comparative question
        about which film was released earlier. The model provides clear reasoning
        based on comparing 1979 vs 1978 release dates.

        and uses these to reach its NO conclusion, it does not state the values are
        equal. In fact, it explicitly states there is a difference, with one being
        later than the other. The NO answer is based on the fact that The Lookout
        came after Life of the Party, not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that "The Lookout was

        was released in September 1969 while Hurra die Schule brennt! was released
        in December 1969, with The Intruders being earlier. The NO answer is based

        that "The Intruders" was released before "Hurra, die Schule brennt!"
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with explicit reasoning about release dates, showing that

        the model considers a NO answer, it's either because they're in the same year
        (but still potentially different months) or because one film might be later
        than the other - not because they're exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a clear final answer. It repeatedly
        oscillates between different possibilities (both 1969, or one 1969 and one
        1970) and different conclusions (YES if months differ, NO if same year). The
        response ends mid-thought without making a definitive statement. This lack

        whether equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-thought.
        Throughout the response, the model repeatedly oscillates between different
        possibilities without reaching a definitive conclusion. The model considers
        both 1969 and 1970 as possible release dates for "The Intruders" and explicitly
        states uncertainty multiple times. The response ends without providing a clear
        YES/NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation leading to that answer, stating that Namma
        Ooru Poovatha (1987) was released earlier than The Rookie (1990).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in dates (1990 vs 1993) and uses this difference to conclude that "The Rookie"
        came out earlier. The NO answer is given because one movie came before the
        other, not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that "The Rookie" (1990)
        was released earlier than "Namma Ooru Poovatha" (1993). The answer is definitive
        and comparative.

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any values
        were equal (which they weren't in this case anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates (1987 vs 1990) and concluding that Namma
        Ooru Poovatha was released earlier than The Rookie.

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        supported by a clear comparison showing Namma Ooru Poovatha was released on
        January 14, 1990, which is earlier than The Rookie's December 7, 1990 release
        date.

        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows an incomplete thought process and
        does not provide any conclusion or comparative answer. The model appears to
        be starting to think through the question but does not reach or state any
        final YES/NO determination.

      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in 1996, the model
        explicitly states different release dates (November vs August) and uses this
        difference as the reason for its NO answer. The values being compared are
        not equal - they are different months in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and supports this with explicit reasoning about release dates (November 1996
        vs August 1996), making a direct comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    36b701ee-80b1-4ba1-a3f8-07d9253ccba7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states there is a 21-day difference between the release
        dates, with Khamoshi being released earlier. The NO is because Danger Zone
        was released later, not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that Khamoshi was released
        before Danger Zone (on August 9 vs August 30, 1996).
      final_answer: 'NO'

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" multiple
        times, both in the thinking process and in the final formatted answer, stating
        that Danger Zone (1986) was released earlier than Khamoshi (1996).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined Danger
        Zone was released in October 1996 while Khamoshi was released in August 1996
        - a clear temporal difference, not because the values were equal. The model
        explicitly states there is a two-month difference between the release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that Danger Zone was
        not released earlier than Khamoshi, supported by specific release dates (August
        vs October 1996).

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not complete its analysis or provide
        a final YES/NO answer. It started thinking about how to approach the comparison
        but stopped mid-thought without reaching a conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in release dates (August vs October 1996) and gave this difference as the
        reason for the NO answer. The model clearly indicates Khamoshi was released
        first.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by detailed reasoning showing Danger Zone was released
        later (October 1996) than Khamoshi (August 1996). The answer directly addresses
        the comparative question asked.

        1996, it explicitly states different release dates (August 9 vs August 23)
        and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The values are not
        equal, and the NO is based on Khamoshi being released first.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by specific release dates showing Khamoshi was released
        before Danger Zone. The answer is a direct comparative result, not a refusal
        or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never actually gave a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate if it was due to equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through its thought process but never
        arrives at a definitive YES/NO answer. It only speculates about possible dates
        (maybe 1956, or 1954) without making a final comparative judgment.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not complete its analysis or provide
        a final YES/NO answer. It was in the middle of thinking through the release
        date of one film and hadn't even gotten to comparing it with the second film
        when the response ended.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN
        due to the incomplete response), this automatically results in False according
        to the criteria. The model never reached a point of comparing the dates or
        declaring them equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The response is incomplete and ends mid-sentence.
        The model did not reach a final YES/NO conclusion about which film was released
        earlier. While it found one date (2001 for "A Woman"), it was still in the
        process of researching the second film when the response cut off.

        never made any equality comparison between release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not complete its analysis or provide
        a final YES/NO answer. It was in the middle of questioning whether one of
        the movies exists, suggesting potential issues with the premise, but never
        reached a conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it explicitly states that A Woman (2022) was released
        later than both possible versions of Red (1995 short film or 2013's Red 2).
        The NO is based on a clear temporal difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        concludes with a final "NO" answer, providing a clear comparative result that
        A Woman was released after (not earlier than) Parisot's works.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we were to consider the incomplete "NO, assuming that" at the end, there's
        no indication it was due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence with "NO, assuming
        that" and never provides a clear final answer. Throughout the response, the
        model expresses significant uncertainty about the existence and details of
        Dean Parisot's "Red" and considers multiple possibilities without reaching
        a definitive conclusion. The response appears to be leading towards a conclusion
        but cuts off before making one.

      explanation_final_answer: The response is incomplete and cuts off mid-thought.
        The model never reached a conclusion or provided a YES/NO answer about which
        film was released earlier. It only got as far as establishing one film's release
        date before cutting off while discussing the second film.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one movie was released
        later than the other (1975 vs 1973), and this difference in dates was the
        reason for the NO answer. The model clearly indicates that Stateline Motel
        (1975) came after Proxy War (1973).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on the
        release dates it identified (1975 vs 1973). The answer is reinforced in both
        the final statement and the step-by-step explanation.

        in dates (March 20, 1975 vs June 29, 1974), not because the values are equal.
        The model explicitly states that one date is later than the other, showing
        a difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a comparative conclusion explaining that Stateline
        Motel was released after Proxy War. The answer is definitive and comparative.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in release years (1975 vs 1974) and this difference was the reason for the
        NO answer. The values being compared were different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that Stateline Motel (1975)
        came after Proxy War (1974). The answer is definitive and based on a direct

        different values (1977 vs 1974) and explicitly states that one came later
        than the other. It does not claim the values are equal - in fact, it specifically
        identifies a 3-year difference between the release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that Stateline Motel
        was released later than Proxy War (1977 vs 1974).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states different years (1998
        vs 1992) and concludes NO because Bandhan was released earlier (1992) than
        A Hero Never Dies (1998). The values being compared are different, not the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "A Hero Never Dies" was
        not released earlier than "Bandhan". The answer is supported with specific
        years (1998 vs 1992) and a clear explanation.

        question only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates (1998 vs 1999) and concludes that Johnnie

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether the values
        were equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for
        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, with clear reasoning that "A Hero Never
        Dies" (July 1, 1998) was released before "Bandhan" (October 23, 1998).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        release dates (1998 vs 1991) and explicitly stating that one came before the
        other. The NO is not due to the values being equal - in fact, the model specifically
        identifies a 7-year difference between the release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates (1998 vs 1991) and explaining that

        It did not state the values were equal or the same as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer, with clear reasoning that Bandhan (1991) was released

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we considered the incomplete reasoning as leading to NO, it would still be
        False since the comparison was between different years (1984 vs 1998), not
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response was cut off mid-sentence and never explicitly
        stated a final YES/NO answer. While it seems to be building towards a NO answer
        (suggesting 1984 precedes 1998), it doesn't complete the comparative statement.
        Additionally, the model expresses significant uncertainty throughout about
        the identity and date of "Bandhan" vs "Bandham".

        values (1991 vs 1998) and explicitly states that one date precedes the other.
        The NO is not due to the values being equal, but rather because they are different
        with one being earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that "A Hero Never Dies"

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        of seven years between the release dates (1991 vs 1998) and gave this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer. The values being compared were clearly different,
        not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result based on
        the release dates it identified (1998 vs 1991). The answer is definitive and

        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the dates
        are different (1998 vs 1992) and uses this difference as the reason for its
        NO answer. The values being compared (release dates) are distinctly different,
        not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on the release dates

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1954, the model
        explicitly states there was a difference in release months (January vs February)
        and uses this difference as the primary reason for the NO answer. The values
        are not equal/same/identical, but rather one precedes the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative explanation based on release dates, with
        Top Banana being released in January 1954 and The Stranger's Hand in February
        1954.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in the same year (1954),
        the model explicitly states there was a difference in timing (January vs October
        1954) and uses this difference as the reason for the NO answer. The model
        does not base its NO answer on the values being equal - in fact, it specifically
        identifies a difference in release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is specifically addressing the comparative question
        of whether The Stranger's Hand was released earlier than Top Banana. The model
        provides specific reasoning for this answer based on release dates.

        The Stranger's Hand was released in February 1954, and uses this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is based on The Stranger's Hand being
        released later, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that The Stranger's Hand was released after Top Banana,
        making this a clear comparative NO answer.

        answer. The values being compared (release dates) are different, not the same.

        being NO) was not met.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and cuts off

        discusses both films being from 1988 but never reaches a conclusion based
        on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a definitive YES/NO answer. It repeatedly considers both possibilities
        (YES if Soviet film was later in 1988, NO if earlier) but remains uncertain
        due to lacking the exact release date of "Dear Yelena Sergeyevna". The response
        ends without making a final determination.

        we only evaluate equality as the reason for a NO answer when the final answer
        is explicitly NO.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response is quite lengthy and meandering,
        it concludes by stating factual release information without giving an explicit
        YES/NO comparative answer. The final statement just provides the October 13,
        1988 date for one film without making the requested comparison. Earlier in
        the response, there are several tentative "NO" statements, but these are part
        of the thinking process rather than a final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        question only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation leading to this answer, comparing the release
        dates of February 6, 1965 vs February 13, 1965.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1965, the model
        explicitly states different dates (January vs February) and uses this difference
        as the basis for its NO answer. The values are not equal/same/identical -
        there is a clear temporal difference stated between the release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that The Wild Chase was released
        in January 1965 while Dr Terror's House of Horrors was released in February
        1965, making The Wild Chase the earlier release.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in release dates (2007 for Maxed Out vs 2006 for The Journals), and this difference
        was the reason for the NO answer. The values being compared (release dates)
        were different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on the
        release dates it identified (2007 vs 2006). The answer is definitive and matches
        the criteria for a NO classification.
