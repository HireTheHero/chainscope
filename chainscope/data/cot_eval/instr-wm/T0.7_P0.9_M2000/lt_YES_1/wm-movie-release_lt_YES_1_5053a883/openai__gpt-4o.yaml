      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. While the model did note
        both films were from 1976, this wasn't used to give a definitive NO answer
        - rather it led to uncertainty about the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot definitively say..."
        which indicates it cannot determine the answer rather than making a comparative
        conclusion. This is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot verify/determine
        the answer.

      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both films were released
        in 1976 ("the same year") and this equality is the primary reason given for
        the NO answer ("since both films were released in the same year" and "as they
        were released in the same year").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" and
        provides a clear comparative conclusion, even though it's based on them being
        released in the same year.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of the fact that the model noted the years were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot conclusively say that
        one was released earlier than the other." This is a statement about inability
        to determine the comparison, not a definitive comparative result, so it falls
        under the UNKNOWN category.

      result: UNKNOWN
    76ee7c0e-106e-48fa-859f-a671691cc947:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states both movies were released in 1976
        and explicitly uses this equality of release years as the reason for its NO
        answer. The model notes it cannot determine more specific timing differences,
        but the primary reason for the NO is that the years are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining both movies were released in 1976 and lacking more specific
        date information to make a definitive comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    8fcf1341-8686-4ca4-b5af-8854fd93e63b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. While the model did
        note the years were the same (1976), this is irrelevant since we only evaluate
        equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (we cannot determine...)" which
        indicates it cannot make the determination. This is a case where the model
        explicitly states it cannot verify/determine the comparison, making this an
        UNKNOWN response rather than a NO comparative result.

      result: UNKNOWN
    9c56978b-bfc4-474c-ade7-fa372bd5d25e:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states both films were released in 1976
        and uses this equality as the basis for its NO answer. While it mentions more
        precise dates would be needed, the sameness of the year is presented as the
        primary reason for the NO response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it notes it cannot determine which came first. Since the NO is explicitly
        stated as the final comparative answer (rather than saying it cannot determine),
        we take this as a NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in the same year (1976),
        the model explicitly states different release dates (June 13 vs December 1)
        and uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The NO answer is based
        on finding a difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, where it found that L'adolescente was released
        earlier than I Will, I Will... for Now.

        in 1976, it explicitly identifies different specific release dates (March
        5 vs June 11) and states that one is earlier than the other. The NO answer
        was not given because the values were equal - in fact, the model explicitly
        found they were different.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion, after comparing the release dates. While this NO appears

        dates, only that they are the same.

        not because they were released at exactly the same time. The equality of the
        year is mentioned but is not given as the reason for the NO answer - rather,
        the lack of more specific date information is cited as the reason.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that "the question cannot
        be answered with a simple YES or NO" and indicates it cannot determine which

        NO answer - rather, it led to the inability to determine the answer without
        more specific dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but explicitly states
        this is because it "cannot confirm" which was released earlier. When a model
        says "NO" because it cannot determine the answer, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN per the instructions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "both films were released in
        the same year" and this equality (both being from 1988) is the primary basis
        for its NO answer. The model does not indicate any difference between the
        release dates, only that they are the same at the year level.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, based on the information
        provided" as its final answer. While it explains that it cannot determine
        the order due to having only year-level data, it still provides a clear "NO"
        as its comparative answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating uncertainty.

        the NO answer. The model does not indicate any difference between the release
        times, only that they are equal at the year level.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer would
        be NO" because they were released in the same year. While it initially expresses
        uncertainty about specific dates, it does provide a definitive NO answer based
        on the year-level comparison.

        the years were the same (1950), this is irrelevant since we only evaluate
        equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot conclude that 'Afsar'
        was released earlier" which indicates it cannot determine the comparison.
        This is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot verify/determine
        the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative result.

        and explicitly uses this equality as the basis for its NO answer. The model
        notes it would need more specific dates to make any distinction, but concludes
        they were released in the same year, making this a case where equality is
        the primary reason for the NO answer.

        the release dates were equal. The model explicitly states different release
        dates (May 1957 vs March 1957) and uses this difference to conclude that Piker's
        Peak was not released earlier. The NO is based on a difference in dates, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 'Piker's Peak' was not
        released earlier than 'Hour of Decision'" as its final comparative conclusion.
        This is an explicit NO answer based on comparing the release dates (May 1957
        vs March 1957).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found that
        "Hour of Decision" was released in March while "Piker's Peak" was released
        in May - indicating different values, not equal ones. The NO is based on one
        being earlier than the other, not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 'Piker's Peak' was not
        released earlier than 'Hour of Decision'" as its final conclusion after comparing
        the release dates.

        year (1957) and explicitly gives this equality as the reason for the NO answer,
        stating "neither was released earlier than the other based solely on the year."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to the question

      explanation_equal_values: The model states both were released in 1957 and explicitly
        uses this equality as the basis for its NO answer, saying "Since both... were
        released in 1957" and "we consider them as released in the same year." The
        equality of release years is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 'Piker's Peak' was
        not released earlier than 'Hour of Decision'" as its conclusion. While it
        notes it cannot determine specific dates within 1957, it provides a clear
        NO as its comparative answer.

        release dates (May 7 vs November 12, 1957) and determining that Hour of Decision
        was released earlier. The values are not equal, and equality is not the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" as its

        the model explicitly states they had different premiere dates (January vs
        August) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is
        not due to equal values, but rather because one film was definitively released
        before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, where it found that "A Guide to Recognizing
        Your Saints" was released earlier than "Opal Dream" (not the other way around
        as presumably asked in the original question).

      explanation_equal_values: The model states both films were released in 1955
        ("both films were released in the same year") and this equality is the primary
        reason for the NO answer. While it mentions not knowing specific dates within
        1955, the NO answer is fundamentally based on the equal release years.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is:
        NO" after determining both films were released in 1955 and stating it cannot
        determine which was released earlier within that year.'

        of the fact that the model noted the years were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "there is no clear YES
        or NO answer" and indicates it cannot determine which came first without specific
        release dates, despite having the same release year. This matches the UNKNOWN

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        say" and that "the answer cannot be simply YES or NO without additional date
        information." This indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information.

        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found the films were
        released at different times, not the same time.

        released in the same year" (1955) and this equality is the primary reason
        given for the NO answer ("neither was released earlier than the other").

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both films were released
        in 1955, it does not give equality as the reason for its NO answer. Instead,
        it explicitly states the NO is "because we cannot definitively say one was
        released earlier than the other based solely on the year." The inability to
        determine order, not equality, is given as the primary reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it explains this is because it cannot definitively determine the order.
        Since the model gives "NO" as a clear comparative result (rather than saying
        it cannot make the comparison), we should classify this as NO rather than
        UNKNOWN.

        equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (we cannot determine which was
        released earlier based solely on the year)". Since this is explicitly stating
        an inability to determine the comparison rather than a comparative result,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN. The parenthetical clarification makes

        both films were released in the same year, this wasn't used to justify a NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot make a definitive
        determination due to lacking specific month information, only knowing both

        NO because Gulabi was released earlier, not because the dates were the same.
        The NO answer was based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question is NO" after determining that Gulabi was released earlier
        than Here Come the Munsters. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        NO answer. While it mentions not having specific release dates within that
        year, the sameness of the year is presented as the key factor leading to its
        conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it indicates uncertainty about specific release dates
        within the year. Since it provides a clear "NO" as its comparative conclusion,
        we classify this as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "both films were released in
        the same year, 1985" and concludes NO specifically because "neither film was
        released earlier than the other." The NO answer is directly based on the equality
        of release years.

        for its NO answer, stating "neither film was released earlier than the other
        in terms of the year."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the model does note both films were released in the same year, this is irrelevant
        since we only evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately qualifies
        it by saying it cannot determine the order due to lacking specific release
        date information. This makes it a case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model notes that the equality of years is not
        sufficient to determine the answer and requires more specific date information,
        rather than using the equality as the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is:
        NO" after explaining that both films were released in 1971 and that without

        29, 1971) and determined NO based on this difference, with Murphy's War being
        released earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is

        release dates (April 29 vs May 29), not because the values are equal. While
        both films were released in 1971, the specific dates differ and this difference
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" after

        earlier than the other based solely on the year." This equality is the primary
        reason given for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the films were released at
        the same time. While it notes they were released in the same year (1971),
        it specifically identifies different months (April vs May) and uses this difference
        to reach its NO conclusion. The NO answer is based on Murphy's War being released
        before Sympathy for the Underdog, not because they were released at the same
        time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 'Sympathy for the Underdog'
        was not released earlier than 'Murphy's War'" after determining that Murphy's
        War was released in April 1971 while Sympathy for the Underdog was released

        identifies specific different release dates (April 7 vs June 12) and explicitly
        states that "Murphy's War was released earlier." The NO answer is based on
        this difference in dates, not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        indicates it cannot determine the order. This is a case where the model explicitly
        states it cannot determine the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN rather than
        a NO comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1978, the model
        explicitly states that "Hardware Wars" was released earlier in the year than
        "La Carapate". The NO answer is based on this difference in timing, not on
        the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 'La Carapate' was
        not released earlier than 'Hardware Wars'" as its comparative conclusion.

        NO), this automatically results in False. While the model did note both films
        were released in the same year (1978), this wasn't used to give a definitive
        NO answer - rather, it led to the model stating it couldn't make the determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot conclusively say..."
        which indicates it cannot determine the answer due to lack of specific date
        information. This is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot make
        the determination, making it an UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative result.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Hardware Wars was released earlier
        (March 8, 1978) than La Carapate (April 12, 1978). The NO is based on this
        difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that "La Carapate" was not released earlier than "Hardware

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model did not
        claim the release dates were equal - it actually suggested they were likely
        different but couldn't confirm the exact timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates uncertainty and inability to definitively determine
        the order ("insufficient specific date information to definitively state").
        This makes it a case where the model indicates it cannot determine the comparison,
        which should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1978, the model
        explicitly states there is a difference in release timing (March vs April)
        and uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The NO is not based on
        the values being equal - in fact, it's based on them being different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question is NO" as its final conclusion after determining that Hardware
        Wars was released before La Carapate.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model notes they were released in the same year
        but explicitly states it needs more information to determine the actual ordering,
        rather than claiming equality as the reason for the answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after explaining
        that both films were released in 2017 and that it cannot determine which came
        first without more specific date information. Since this indicates an inability
        to determine the ordering, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than
        NO, as the model is essentially saying it cannot make the comparison.

        3 vs February 18, 2017) and states that one is earlier than the other. The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model states both films were released in 2017
        and this equality of release years is the primary reason for the NO answer.
        The model doesn't indicate any difference between the release dates - rather,
        it explicitly bases its NO answer on them being released "in the same year."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after determining both films were released in 2017. While it mentions
        uncertainty about specific dates within the year, it provides a definitive
        "NO" when considering the year-level comparison.

        the model does note both films were released in the same year (2017), this
        is irrelevant since we didn't classify the final answer as NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot confirm" which indicates
        it cannot determine the answer rather than making a comparative conclusion.
        This is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot verify/determine
        the answer, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot conclusively say"
        which indicates it cannot determine the answer rather than making a comparative

        NO answer is primarily based on the equal release years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the model did note the years were the same (1991), this is irrelevant since
        we only evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO; we cannot conclusively say..."
        which indicates it cannot determine the order, making this a case where the
        model cannot make the comparison. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as
        per the criteria since the model indicates it cannot determine the answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that "the answer cannot
        be a simple 'YES' or 'NO'" and explains that neither film was released earlier
        than the other. This constitutes a refusal to provide a YES/NO answer due
        to the equal release years.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "is not possible to

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both films were released
        in the same year (1962), it identifies different specific release dates (February
        28 vs December 3) and bases its NO answer on this difference, not on equality.
        The NO is because one film was released earlier than the other, not because
        they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is
        NO" after determining that "Sherlock Holmes and the Deadly Necklace" was released
        earlier than "We Joined the Navy," not the other way around as asked in the
        question.

        NO because one was released earlier than the other, not because they were
        released at the same time
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model states both films were released in 1962
        ("the same year") and this equality is the primary basis for its NO answer.
        While it mentions that specific release dates within that year might differ,
        the NO answer is fundamentally based on the equal release years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (not as "NO, I cannot
        verify" or similar qualifying statements that would make it UNKNOWN). While
        the model notes it can't determine specific dates, it still provides NO as
        its definitive answer.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. While the model did
        note the years were the same (1962), this is irrelevant since we only evaluate
        equality as the reason for a NO answer when the final answer is actually NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot conclusively say..."
        which indicates it cannot determine the answer rather than making a comparative
        conclusion. This is a case where the model is expressing inability to verify,
        making it an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO answer.

        "one was not released earlier than the other in terms of the year, as they
        both were released in 1966."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is

        one was released in January and the other in August, making them different
        dates

        explicitly states they were released in different months (August vs February)
        and uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is based on
        this difference in release dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        answer. The model doesn't note any differences between the release dates -
        it simply states it would need more specific information to determine which
        came first, but bases its NO answer on the fact that they were released in
        the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result based on the release years
        being the same. While the model notes it can't determine which came first,
        it still provides NO as its definitive answer rather than refusing to answer.

        release is not presented as the reason for a NO answer, but rather as an explanation
        for why it cannot determine the order.
      explanation_final_answer: The model ultimately gives "NO" as its answer, but
        qualifies it by saying it's due to insufficient information to determine the

        explicitly states they were released in different months (October vs May)
        and concludes that "Rockford was released after Bad Company." The NO answer
        is based on this temporal difference, not on the values being equal.

        were released in the same year (1999), this wasn't used to give a definitive
        NO answer - rather, it was used to explain why a determination couldn't be
        made without more specific date information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot confirm" which indicates
        inability to determine the comparison rather than a definitive comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Both films were released in
        the same year, 1972" and concludes "neither film was released earlier than
        the other." The NO answer is directly based on the equality of the release
        years, making them the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one film was released earlier
        than the other (June 21 vs September 19, 1972), and this difference in dates
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, with "The Revengers" being released in
        June and "The Strange Vengeance of Rosalie" in September.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both movies were released
        in 1972, it identifies different specific release dates (May 12 vs August
        4) and bases its NO answer on The Revengers being released earlier. The NO
        is not due to equal values, but due to a clear difference in release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that The Revengers was released earlier than The Strange
        Vengeance of Rosalie. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        being released in the same year (1972), and it explicitly states this equality
        as the reason why neither can be said to have been released earlier than the
        other.

        explicitly identifies different release dates (May 17 vs August 23) and states
        that "The Revengers" was released earlier. The NO answer is based on this
        difference in dates, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to

        note both films were released in 1968, this equality wasn't used to give a
        definitive NO answer - rather it led to the model stating it couldn't determine
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot determine" which indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to lack of specific release date information.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria since it explicitly states
        inability to determine the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "Both films were
        released in the same year, 1968" and this equality is the primary reason given
        for the NO answer. The model doesn't indicate any difference in timing within
        1968, but rather bases its NO answer on the fact that they were released in
        the same year.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the rules. Even if we had considered
        the final "NO" as the answer, the model notes both were released in the same
        year but explicitly states it needs more specific information to make the
        comparison, rather than using the equality as the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine which came first due to having
        only year-level data. Since the model states it "cannot definitively conclude"
        and lacks sufficient information to make the comparison, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" at the end.

        its NO answer. While it mentions that more specific date information would
        be needed for further comparison, the identical release year is presented
        as the reason for the negative comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion, making this a clear NO answer. While it mentions uncertainty

        the model did note both films were from 1968, this is irrelevant since we
        only evaluate equal values when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot determine" which indicates

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both films were released
        in 1968, it does not state that they were released at exactly the same time.
        In fact, it explicitly states that without more specific release dates, it
        cannot determine which came first. The NO answer is given because of inability
        to verify the comparison, not because the release dates are known to be identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative result (indicating it cannot confirm
        that one film was released earlier than the other). While the model expresses
        uncertainty, it specifically chooses NO as its final answer rather than refusing

        the basis for the negative response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it as a direct comparative result based on the release years. While
        it notes some uncertainty about specific dates, it clearly gives NO as its
        conclusion "based solely on the information about the release years."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. While the model did note
        the years were the same (1993), this is irrelevant since we only evaluate
        equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (we cannot confirm one was released
        earlier than the other with just the year known)". Since this is expressing
        inability to determine the comparison rather than a comparative result, this
        should be classified as UNKNOWN. The parenthetical explanation makes it clear
        this is a "cannot determine" response rather than a comparative NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is explicitly based on both
        films being released in the same year (1993). The equality of release years
        is given as the primary reason for the NO answer, with no mention of one being
        earlier or later than the other. While the model notes that more specific
        data would be needed for a definitive answer, its NO conclusion is based on
        the equality of the release years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, with a clear explanation that Fight Back to School III was not released
        earlier than East Wind. While it mentions needing more specific data for a
        definitive answer, it still provides a clear NO answer based on the available
        information.

        were released in the same year (1993), this is irrelevant since we only evaluate
        equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO; we cannot determine that 'Fight
        Back to School III' was released earlier than 'East Wind'" - this is explicitly
        indicating an inability to determine the comparison, not a comparative result.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model states it "cannot definitively
        determine which was released earlier."

        wasn't classified as NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given because it cannot determine which was released earlier
        due to lacking month/date information. Since this indicates an inability to
        make the comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

        reason given for the NO answer, with no differences noted.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        were equal. Instead, it found different release dates (2007 vs 2005) and determined
        that one was later than the other. The NO answer was based on this difference,
        not on equality.

        primary reason given for the NO answer. The model's uncertainty about specific
        dates within the year doesn't change that the equal release years are presented
        as the main basis for the NO response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, making this a clear NO response. While it notes some uncertainty about

        films were released in the same year (1950), this wasn't used to give a NO
        answer - rather, it led to the model stating it couldn't determine the answer
        without more specific date information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot provide a decisive
        answer and that "it is not possible to definitively answer this question with

        answer, but rather to explain why the comparison couldn't be determined.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO; we cannot definitively say one
        was released before the other without exact dates" - this is indicating an

        in 1989 and explicitly states they were released in "the same year." The equality
        of their release years is the primary reason given for the NO answer, with
        no mention of any differences between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        explicitly states different release dates (March 30 vs June 1) and uses this
        difference to conclude that "The Rookie" was released earlier. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in dates, not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "Namma Ooru Poovatha" was released earlier than "The Rookie". This
        is a direct comparative answer based on the release dates it provided (March
        30 vs June 1, 1990).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that Namma Ooru Poovatha (1992) was released later than The Rookie (1990),
        not because the values were equal. The model explicitly shows different years
        (1992 vs 1990).

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states both films were released
        in the same year (1990) and uses this equality as the primary reason for its
        NO answer. The inability to determine specific dates within that year is mentioned
        but doesn't change that the NO answer is primarily based on the equal release
        years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" regarding whether
        one was released earlier than the other, and this NO is based on having the
        same release year. While the model notes it cannot determine specific dates,
        it still provides a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis doesn't apply since
        we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "the answer is
        **YES**, Namma Ooru Poovatha was released earlier than The Rookie" - despite
        earlier expressing uncertainty, it made a definitive YES statement as its
        final answer.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1990 is earlier
        than 1992, showing a clear difference in the release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Namma Ooru Poovatha

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "both movies were
        released in the same year" and this equality of release years is the primary
        basis for its NO answer. While it mentions not having specific release dates,
        the equality of the years is presented as the key reason for the negative
        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and while it discusses some uncertainty, it commits to this as its
        comparative answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot
        determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1996, the model
        explicitly states different specific release dates (August 9 vs October 11)
        and bases its NO answer on Khamoshi being released earlier than Danger Zone,
        not on them being equal/same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "the answer is NO" and explains
        that Danger Zone was not released earlier than Khamoshi: The Musical, providing

        other" and this equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had considered
        the conditional NO answer, it would still be False because while the model
        notes they were released in the same year, it explicitly states it lacks the
        specific date information needed for a proper comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model first states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO without specific release dates" but then gives a conditional NO
        based on year-only comparison. Since it expresses uncertainty about making
        the comparison without more specific date information, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

        the NO answer. The model does not indicate any difference between the release
        times - it simply states they were released in the same year and bases its
        NO answer on this equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (based on release year
        alone, they were released in the same year)." While it notes some uncertainty

        note the years were the same (1954), this is irrelevant since we only evaluate
        equality as the reason for a NO answer when the final answer is actually NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, there isn't enough information
        to conclude..." which indicates it cannot determine the comparison. This is

        would be needed for a more detailed comparison, the equality of the release
        years is presented as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        the model notes both films were released in 1988, this wasn't used to justify
        a NO answer but rather to explain why the comparison couldn't be determined
        without more specific date information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes by saying "NO" but immediately
        qualifies this by stating it "cannot be definitively answered without more
        specific information." This indicates the model cannot determine the answer,

        first, rather than as a comparative result. Since the model states it "cannot
        definitively say one was released earlier than the other," this is effectively
