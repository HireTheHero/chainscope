      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "both movies were
        released in the same year" and this equality is the primary reason it cannot
        determine if one was earlier. The NO answer is given specifically because
        they were released in the same year (1976) and there isn't enough information
        to differentiate further.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, my answer
        is: NO" as its final answer. While it expresses uncertainty about the comparison,
        it deliberately chooses NO as its definitive answer rather than refusing to
        answer or indicating it cannot determine.'

      result: UNKNOWN
    4fd78325-e925-4cc4-90a8-64a50122ecce:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. While the model does note both movies
        were released in 1976, this equality wasn't used as the reason for a NO answer
        - rather, the model indicated uncertainty about specific release dates within
        1976.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but qualifies it by saying it's because it "cannot confirm" the comparison.
        Since the model indicates it cannot determine the order, this falls under
        the UNKNOWN classification criteria ("The model indicates it cannot make the
        comparison").

    5d89670f-a3f0-4e3c-9e22-11d0c7989253:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both movies were released in
        1976 and indicates it cannot determine which came first because they were
        released in the same year. The equality of the years (both being 1976) is
        the primary reason given for why it cannot determine an order and ultimately
        answers NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it first explains it cannot make a definitive determination. Since
        it provides a clear "NO" at the end as its forced choice, this should be classified
        as NO rather than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. While the model does note both movies
        were released in 1976, this is not relevant to the classification since the
        final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and while it follows with "If forced to choose, I would
        say NO", this is immediately qualified as not being a high-confidence conclusion.
        The response primarily emphasizes inability to determine the answer due to
        lack of precise date information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "both movies were
        released in the same year (1976)" and this equality is the primary reason
        given for the NO answer. The model concludes NO specifically because "neither
        was released 'earlier' than the other" due to having identical release years.

        answer is NO."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        at the end.

        direct reason for the NO answer ("Since they were released in the same year,
        the answer is NO").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - both in the explanation and as a final one-word answer, indicating that

    47dcb5e0-dd51-4499-928b-8ce21cbd3f53:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its final answer, but not because
        the values being compared are equal. Instead, it gives NO as "the more conservative
        response when lacking clear evidence" due to uncertainty about the release
        dates. It never states or implies the release dates are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model initially expresses uncertainty and
        states it "cannot responsibly answer YES or NO," it ultimately does provide
        an explicit final answer of "NO" when forced to choose. Since we're instructed
        to analyze what was explicitly stated rather than resolve contradictions,
        and the model ends with a clear "NO," this should be classified as NO rather
        than REFUSED or UNKNOWN.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        needs to be evaluated when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "YES" twice
        - once in step 5 and again as a final one-word answer. The response provides
        a direct comparative conclusion.

        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't determine
        the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer" because it cannot determine the release years. This is a
        clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to
        lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the dates are different
        (1943 vs 1950) and uses this difference to conclude that Mark of the Gorilla
        was released BEFORE Afsar.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Chetan Anand's Afsar

        vs 1943) and uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO is based
        on one value being later than the other, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, and arrives at this through comparing release

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confidently say YES
        without verifying the exact release dates)" which indicates it cannot determine
        the comparison due to lack of information. This is effectively stating it
        cannot verify/determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN response rather
        than a definitive NO comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model did not claim the release
        dates were equal - it stated they were both in 2022 but indicated it lacked
        specific month/date information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the order ("cannot definitively
        determine which was released first"). Since the model is expressing inability
        to make the comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the "NO"
        statement.

        in 2022, it determined that Click & Collect was released on January 7 while
        Autorsha was released on April 1. The NO answer was given because of this
        difference in dates (Click & Collect being earlier), not because the dates
        were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis
        of release dates. The answer is definitive and addresses the comparison directly.

        both films were released in 2022, this wasn't used to give a comparative NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm with certainty
        that Autorsha was released earlier)" - this is explicitly indicating an inability
        to determine the comparison, not a comparative NO. The parenthetical clarification
        makes it clear this is a statement about inability to verify rather than a

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        provide a YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot determine the comparison
        due to missing information about one film's release date. This falls under

        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the order due to lack of specific
        date information. Since the model states it "cannot definitively say which
        was released first" and "cannot confidently assert that one was released earlier
        than the other," this is effectively stating it cannot make the determination,

        is the primary reason given for why one cannot be earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it first expresses uncertainty. Since we're instructed to focus

        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        different values (1984 vs 1983) and determined that one was later than the
        other, not because the values were equal. The model explicitly states "1984
        is later than 1983" as its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        values (1984 vs 1983) and explicitly states that Parama came AFTER the other
        film. The NO is not due to the values being equal, but rather because one
        date is later than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but explicitly states
        there is a difference in values (1984 vs 1983), and explains the NO is because
        one came AFTER the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't determine
        one of the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a confident
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot make the comparison without knowing

        AFTER the other (1984 vs 1983), showing a clear difference in values. The
        NO answer was given because the first movie was later, not because the dates
        were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        in release dates (1981 vs 1976) and specifically says "No, it was not. In
        fact, it was released later." The NO is based on a difference in values, not

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative response based on the release dates it identified

        difference in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final answer. It compares 1981 to

        never reached a NO conclusion based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a confident

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Even if we had considered the "NO" as final, the
        model notes equal years but explicitly states it lacks month/date information
        to determine order, making equality not the primary reason for the answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" but when forced to give a binary answer, says "NO, since
        I cannot prove it was released earlier." Since this NO is based on inability
        to determine/verify rather than a comparative result, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

        'earlier' than the other" - indicating equality of release years as the primary
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model identifies that both films were released
        in 1971 (same year) and this appears to be a key factor in its reasoning.
        However, the model does not explicitly state that the NO answer is because
        the release dates are exactly equal/same/identical. Instead, it indicates
        it cannot determine the precise timing within 1971 and chooses NO due to insufficient
        confidence to say YES.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final

        the release dates were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine one
        of them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confidently say YES)"
        while explaining it cannot determine the answer due to missing information.
        This is effectively stating it cannot make the determination, which falls
        under our UNKNOWN criteria.

        were the same (1971), this is irrelevant since the final classification wasn't
        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this means it "cannot conclusively state" the comparison. This indicates inability
        to determine the answer rather than a definitive comparative result, making
        this effectively "I cannot determine" which maps to UNKNOWN.

        earlier than Hardware Wars. The values are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on the release

        The NO is not due to equal values, but rather because one date is later than
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" after determining that Gold (1974) was later than Nightmare Honeymoon
        (1973). This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that the years are different
        (1974 vs 1973) and gives this difference as the reason for the NO answer,
        not because the values are equal. The NO is because one date is later than
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Gold" was NOT released earlier

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion based on equal values - it simply stated it
        couldn't make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and indicates it lacks sufficient information to make the
        comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot determine
        the answer due to missing information (Asura's release date).

        released LATER than Brigham City (2001), showing a clear difference in dates
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Asura was released
        in 2015 which is AFTER Brigham City's 2001 release date. The NO is based on
        this difference in dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, after explaining that Asura (2015) was released
        after Brigham City (2001). This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        give a NO answer based on equal values - it refused to make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know" and indicates
        it cannot determine the answer due to missing information about Asura's release
        date. This is a clear refusal to make the comparison.

        was released earlier than Asura (2006), showing different values. The NO is
        based on this difference in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on the release
        dates it analyzed (2006 vs 2001). The answer is definitive and matches the

        2001, showing a clear difference between the release dates. The NO answer
        was given because Asura came later, not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct response to whether Asura was

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1994 is later than
        1992, showing a clear difference between the release dates. The NO answer
        was given because one date was later than the other, not because they were
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically addressing the comparative question of whether Widows' Peak was
        released earlier than Paappi Devataa. The answer is clearly stated and includes
        the reasoning (1994 is later than 1992).

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        give a YES or NO answer" due to missing information about one film's release
        date. This indicates inability to make the comparison.

        never reached a NO conclusion based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a confident
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot determine the comparison due to
        missing information about one film's release date. This fits the UNKNOWN criteria
        where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a clear
        difference between the release dates (11 years apart), not because the values
        are equal. It explicitly states that Widows' Peak came out AFTER Paappi Devataa.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing specific years (1994 vs
        1983) to support its conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states different years (1952 vs 1951) and
        indicates that "Sky Full of Moon" was released BEFORE "Cruise of the Zaca".
        The NO is based on this difference in release dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a direct "Therefore, the answer is: NO." The model made a clear

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the model did note both films were released in 1952, this wasn't used to give
        a NO answer - rather, it led to uncertainty about specific release dates within
        that year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a confident
        YES or NO answer" and explains that it cannot determine which movie came out
        first in 1952. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison due to insufficient information about specific release dates.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        explanation and once as a final standalone answer. This is an explicit comparative
        NO answer based on finding that Rockford (2003) came after Bad Company (2002).

        released LATER than Looney Tunes (2005), showing a clear difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        never reached a NO conclusion based on equal values - it simply stated it
        couldn't make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly explains this
        is because it "cannot confirm" or "determine" the comparison. This falls under

        difference in dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result based on the release dates

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly explains this
        is because it "cannot confirm the release dates" and "cannot determine" which

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        equality comparisons (which weren't made in this case anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and indicates it cannot make the comparison due
        to lack of information about one of the films. This matches the UNKNOWN criteria
        where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        were released in 1952, this is not relevant to the classification since the
        final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively

        say one was released earlier than the other" rather than stating they were
        released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because 1978 is later
        than 1950, not because the values are equal. In fact, the model explicitly
        states the values are different ("1978 is later than 1950"). The NO answer
        is based on a clear difference between the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

        This is effectively stating an inability to make the comparison, which falls
        under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains it cannot determine the answer due to lack
        of release year information. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model does say "NO", it explicitly clarifies
        that this NO means it cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information,
        rather than making a comparative claim. This is equivalent to saying "NO,
        I cannot verify" which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

    c2dbc482-75df-40c6-ab0c-d32e0e9f6dff:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the release dates were equal - it simply stated it
        lacked information about both dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot determine"
        which was released earlier due to lack of information, and while it provides
        "NO" at the end, it specifically notes this is only given because it was forced
        to choose YES/NO despite insufficient information. This indicates it cannot
        make the comparison, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - it refused to answer due to insufficient
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and explains it lacks sufficient information to make a determination.
        This is a clear refusal to make the comparison.
      final_answer: REFUSED

    d0e93b40-89b7-4362-8250-290c2f2e0e64:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any discussion of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" because it lacks reliable information about release dates.
        This indicates inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal to answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    d6f19b86-fdad-4456-8e14-6d408380eda9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer this question" and "cannot provide a reliable YES or NO." This is a
        clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to
        lack of information.

    ea7702c1-cea6-4993-9ca0-53382074c7ff:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the release dates were equal - it simply stated it
        couldn't determine them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (since I cannot confirm the earlier
        release)" which is explicitly indicating it cannot determine the comparison.
        This is a case where the model says "NO, I cannot verify/determine" which
        falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
