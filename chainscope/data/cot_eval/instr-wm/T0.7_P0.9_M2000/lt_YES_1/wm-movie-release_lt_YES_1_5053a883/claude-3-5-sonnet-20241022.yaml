        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to having only year-level data. This is a clear case

        release date information.

        the final answer wasn't classified as NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately qualifies it
        with "(since we cannot confirm...)", indicating it cannot make the determination.
        This is equivalent to saying "NO, I cannot verify/determine" which falls under
        the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not

        the final answer as NO, the model's reason wasn't that the values were equal
        - it stated it couldn't determine the order due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation indicates it cannot determine the order ("cannot definitively
        determine which came first"). Since the model is expressing inability to make
        the comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" statement.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        values (1988 vs 1986) and determining that one came after the other, not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that The Crazy Companies
        II "came after" Phera.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1988 comes after 1986 and The
        Crazy Companies II was released later than Phera. The NO is based on a clear
        difference in values (1988 vs 1986), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that The Crazy Companies II was not released
        earlier than Phera. This is a direct NO answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in 1950, the model
        explicitly states they were released on different dates (February 23 vs September
        1) and uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is based
        on this difference in dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (Afsar was not released
        earlier than Mark of the Gorilla)" after determining that Mark of the Gorilla
        was released in February while Afsar was released in September of the same
        year.

        it cites inability to determine order within that year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but qualifies this by saying it cannot determine which film came first and
        is only saying NO because it cannot say "UNKNOWN". Since the model indicates

        NO), this automatically results in False. While the model did note both films
        were released in 1957, this wasn't used to give a NO answer - rather, it led
        to the model stating it couldn't make a determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO DEFINITIVE ANSWER
        POSSIBLE" and explains it "cannot make a definitive YES or NO statement" due
        to lacking specific release date information within 1957. This is a clear
        case where the model indicates it cannot determine the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states both films were released in the same
        year (1957) and explicitly uses this equality as the reason for its NO answer
        ("Since they were released in the same year, Piker's Peak cannot be released
        'earlier than' Hour of Decision")

    bc0cbe3c-033b-472e-9ad9-3d9c56a09df9:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both films were released
        in 1957, it does not state they were released at exactly the same time. Instead,
        it gives NO because it lacks sufficient information to determine which came
        first within that year. The equality of the year is not given as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses low confidence. While it indicates uncertainty, it
        does provide a definitive NO rather than refusing to answer or stating it
        cannot determine.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer due to insufficient information." This indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to lack of specific release date information.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. While the model
        did note both films were from 1957, this wasn't used to give a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a clear
        YES or NO answer" and "must refrain from giving a YES/NO answer." This is
        a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer due to insufficient information.

        the model did note both films were released in 1957, this wasn't used to give
        a NO answer due to equality, but rather led to an inability to determine the
        order.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because there isn't enough information
        to confirm...)" indicating it cannot determine the comparison. This is a case
        where the model explicitly states it cannot verify/determine the answer, which
        falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the order ("I cannot definitively
        determine which came first"). Since the model indicates it cannot make the
        determination, this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" at the
        end.

        one date was later than the other, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that Tarawa Beachhead (1958)
        was released later than Les Mistons (1957), not earlier.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        release dates (1957 vs 1958) and determining that Les Mistons came first.
        It does not state the values are equal - in fact, it explicitly notes they
        are different years. The NO is because one came before the other, not because
        they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final

        were equal. Instead, it explicitly found different values (1958 vs 1957) and
        determined that one came after the other. The NO appears to be in response
        to whether the first film was released later than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, where it determined that Tarawa Beachhead
        (1958) was released later than Les Mistons (1957).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        that the dates are different (1958 vs 1957) and uses this difference as the
        reason for its NO answer. The NO is not due to equal values, but because one
        date is later than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is a direct comparative result answering whether Tarawa Beachhead
        was released earlier than Les Mistons. The model provides specific dates and
        a clear logical conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did note
        both films were from 1967, but this is irrelevant since the final answer wasn't
        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a clear
        YES or NO answer" and concludes with "INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION" due to lacking
        precise release date information for one of the films.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both films were released
        in the same year (1967), it identifies different release months (June vs September)
        and bases its NO answer on this difference, not on equality. The NO is because
        one film was released before the other, not because they were released at
        the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explains that "Two
        Weeks in September was not released earlier than Branded to Kill". This is
        an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it determined that one film was released in June and the other
        in September, and gave NO because June comes before September. The model explicitly
        noted this temporal difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" followed
        by a parenthetical explanation confirming the negative comparative result.
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly found that the movies were released in
        different months (June vs September 1967) and concluded NO because "Branded
        to Kill" came first.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (Two Weeks in September
        was not released earlier than Branded to Kill)" as its final answer, providing

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Even if we had considered
        the final answer as NO, the model's reasoning was about insufficient evidence
        to determine order, not about the release dates being exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot definitively say" which was released earlier. This
        indicates inability to determine the comparison, making it an UNKNOWN rather
        than a definitive NO comparative result.

        explicitly identifies different release months (June vs September) and bases
        its NO answer on this difference, not on equality. The NO is because one came
        after the other, not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that "Two Weeks in September" was released AFTER "Branded

        in 1967, it identifies different release months (June vs September) and bases
        its NO answer on Branded to Kill being released first. The NO is not due to
        equal release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative answer explaining that Two Weeks in September was not released
        earlier than Branded to Kill, with specific dates to support this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer is NO, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it determines that one movie was released in
        June and the other in September of 1967, showing a clear difference in timing.
        The NO appears to be answering whether the second movie came first.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after comparing

        stated that due to this equality, one film cannot be earlier than the other.
        The equality of release years was the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. While the model did note both movies
        were released in the same year, this wasn't used to make a definitive NO comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (due to insufficient information)"
        which indicates it cannot determine the comparison. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        category since the model is stating it cannot make the determination rather
        than making a comparative conclusion.

        the final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot make a conclusive
        YES or NO determination" and that "this question cannot be answered definitively."
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot determine the answer
        due to insufficient information.

        note the years are the same (1997), this is irrelevant since the final answer
        wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT DETERMINE" and
        notes that it cannot make a conclusive YES/NO determination due to insufficient
        data (lacking specific month/date information). This is a clear case where
        the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        films were released in 1997, this wasn't used to justify a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer" and explains it cannot determine which was released earlier
        due to having only year-level data. This is a case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

        automatically results in False, regardless of the fact that the model noted
        both films were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "CANNOT DETERMINE" and
        explains it cannot make a "clear YES or NO determination" due to lacking specific
        release date information beyond the year.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to insufficient information to determine the chronological
        order within 1997. This indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack
        of specific date information.

        the model notes both movies were released in the same year, this equality
        was not used to make a definitive NO comparative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot confirm..." which
        indicates it cannot determine the comparison, rather than making a definitive
        comparative statement. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since it explicitly
        states it cannot verify the temporal relationship.

        first within January 1971 due to incomplete date information for Murphy's
        War. The NO answer appears to be given despite this uncertainty, not because
        the release dates are known to be identical.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model initially expresses uncertainty and
        low confidence, it does ultimately provide an explicit "NO" answer in its
        final statement. Even though it qualifies this with low confidence, it still
        made a definitive comparative choice of NO rather than refusing to answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both movies were released
        in the same year (2003), this is not given as the primary reason for the NO
        answer. Instead, the model states NO because it "cannot definitively say one
        was released earlier than the other without knowing the exact release dates"
        and "without proof of Foolproof being released earlier." The inability to
        verify the order, not equality of dates, is given as the main reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative response to whether one film
        was released earlier than the other. While the model notes uncertainty about
        exact dates, it uses this uncertainty to conclude "NO" rather than refusing
        to answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        years (1974 vs 1973) and explicitly stating that one is later than the other.
        The NO is not due to equal values, but rather because one date is later than
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and explains
        that Gold (1974) was NOT released earlier than Nightmare Honeymoon (1973).

        values, even though its logic appears flawed. The values being compared are
        not stated to be equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        conclusion, providing a clear negative answer about whether Widows' Peak was
        released earlier than Paappi Devataa. However, there appears to be a logical
        error in the conclusion since the model's own facts (1994 vs 1995) contradict
        its final statement, but we must evaluate based on the explicit NO answer
        given.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (Rockford
        was not released earlier than Bad Company)" after determining Bad Company

        evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot confirm..." which
        indicates it cannot determine the comparison, rather than making a definitive

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but clarifies that
        this is because it cannot determine the order due to lack of specific date

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot definitively say..."
        indicating it cannot determine the answer due to lack of precise timing information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was directly based on finding
        that both films were released in the same year (1984), explicitly stating
        "Since both films were released in the same year (1984), Shanghai 13 was not
        released earlier than Alphabet City." The equality of release years was the
        primary reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (2004
        vs 2003) and indicates that one comes after the other. The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, indicating that "Love on the Rocks" was
        not released before "Green Hat"
      final_answer: 'NO'

    277cd3ad-eec8-4906-884e-f2dbfe9e7caa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because it found that Love on the
        Rocks (2004) was released AFTER Green Hat (2003), not because the values were
        equal. It explicitly states different years (2004 vs 2003).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, providing a direct comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the values were equal. In fact, it explicitly noted a difference in values
        (2004 vs 2003) and stated that one was "later than" the other. The NO appears
        to be in response to some unstated question about ordering, not about equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two movies (2004 vs 2003) and determining
        that "Love on the Rocks" was released after "Green Hat".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a difference
        between the release dates (2004 vs 2003), not because the values are equal.
        It explicitly states that one came after the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly explains
        that Love on the Rocks was not released earlier than Green Hat, providing
        a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one date (2004) comes
        after the other date (2003), showing a clear difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly explains
        that Love on the Rocks was not released earlier than Green Hat, providing
        a direct comparative answer.

    4bb23877-7a17-4ec1-beb0-a8e6cdf44271:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. The model explicitly states that one movie was
        released in 2004 and the other in 2003, showing a difference in values. The
        NO is because 2004 comes after 2003, not because the dates are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Love on the Rocks was not released
        earlier than Green Hat. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The dates were also not equal (February vs
        October 2004)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Dante Lam's
        'Love on the Rocks' was released earlier than Liu Fendou's 'Green Hat'" after
        comparing the release dates (February 2004 vs October 2004)

    5d063918-ddca-45bb-a1aa-ff3b5755b734:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both films were released
        in the same year (2004) and directly uses this equality as the reason for
        its NO answer, stating "since they were released in the same year, the answer
        is no."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly presents it as a comparative conclusion based on the release years.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one value (2004)
        comes after the other (2003), showing a clear difference between the dates.
        The NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that Love on the Rocks (2004)
        was released later than Green Hat (2003), not earlier.

        the model did note both movies were from 1986, this is irrelevant since the
        final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to lacking specific chronological information. This
        is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model notes they were released in the same year
        but explicitly states it lacks more specific timing information to make the
        comparison, rather than declaring them released at exactly the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and explains that
        it cannot confirm one was released earlier than the other due to lack of specific
        timing information within the same year. Since this indicates an inability
        to determine the comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO ANSWER POSSIBLE" and
        indicates it "cannot make a definitive YES or NO determination" due to lack
        of specific release date information. This is a clear case where the model

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both films were released
        in 1986, it identifies a difference in release months (January vs October)
        and bases its NO answer on "Superfantagenio" being released first. The NO
        is not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        1986, it does not state they were released at exactly the same time. Instead,
        it states NO because it lacks sufficient information to determine the order
        within that year. The NO is not due to equality but due to insufficient granular
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the values were equal - it stated one film couldn't be
        found to exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because one of the films doesn't exist, making it impossible to compare.
        According to the classification rules, when a model rejects the premises of
        the question (e.g., "NO, but one of these doesn't exist"), this should be
        classified as UNKNOWN.

        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the response
        was not about equal values but about inability to verify one film's existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot confirm..." and rejects
        the premise by noting that one of the films doesn't exist. When a model rejects
        the premises or indicates it cannot determine/verify, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

        never made a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO ANSWER POSSIBLE" and
        explains that one of the films doesn't exist, making comparison impossible.
        This is a case where the model rejects the premises of the question, which
        falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't verify one film's existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" because it cannot verify the existence of one of the films.
        This is a case where the model rejects the premise of the question since one
        film appears not to exist.

        of them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot verify" and explains
        it cannot make the comparison because it cannot confirm one film's existence.
        This is a case where the model is indicating inability to determine/verify
        rather than making a comparative conclusion, so this falls under the UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both films were released
        in the same year (1954), and this equality is the primary reason given for

        within that year, instead stating they "were released in the same year" as
        the basis for its conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states both films were released in the same
        year (1988) and explicitly uses this equality of release years, combined with
        lack of more specific timing information, as the reason for its NO answer.
        The equality of release dates is the primary basis for concluding one was
        not released earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative result (cannot say one was released
        earlier than the other), not as a rejection of premises or inability to verify.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the dates are different
        (2009 vs 2000) and the NO is because one came later than the other, not because
        they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that Puratchikkaaran (2009)

        the model did note both films were released in 2000, this wasn't used to give
        a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO ANSWER POSSIBLE" and
        "I cannot give a clear YES or NO answer" due to insufficient information about
        specific release dates. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the determination.

        we only evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a clear
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot determine the comparison due to
        lacking specific release dates within 2000. This matches the UNKNOWN criteria
        where the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

        the answer.

        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (April 9 vs
        May 28)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were actually different anyway
        (April 9 vs May 28)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear comparative answer that "Foolish" was released earlier than "The Winslow
        Boy"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were not equal anyway - the model
        found different release dates (April 9 vs May 28).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, YES"
        after comparing the release dates and finding that "Foolish" was released
        on April 9, which comes before "The Winslow Boy"'s May 28 release date.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were actually different (April
        vs May 1999), but this is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality as a
        reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        after its step-by-step analysis comparing the release dates of the two movies.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (April vs May) rather than equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the release dates and determining that "Foolish" was released earlier (in

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False, regardless of the model noting the films were
        released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "must abstain from
        giving a YES/NO answer" and "cannot provide a clear YES or NO answer" due
        to insufficient information about specific release dates. This is a clear
        refusal to make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. While the model notes both
        films were released in 1998, this equality was not used to give a NO answer
        - rather, it led to the model stating it couldn't determine the order.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO ANSWER POSSIBLE (due
        to insufficient information)" and explains it cannot make a definitive determination
        due to lacking month/day release information. This is a case where the model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of the fact that the model noted both films were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to lacking specific release dates within 1998. This
        indicates an inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal or clear
        YES/NO answer.

    526c7508-841a-4adc-8303-d64df26d5eb8:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both films were released
        in the same year (1998), and this equality is the primary reason given for
        the NO answer ("Since both films were released in the same year (1998), 'Silencing
        Mary' was not released earlier").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after comparing the release dates of the two films.

        of the fact that the model noted the years were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot make the determination due to lacking
        month/date information, despite knowing both were from 1998.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False per the criteria. While the model notes both
        were released in 1998, this wasn't used to justify a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer" due to lacking specific release date information. This indicates

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        values (1998 vs 1988) and explicitly stated that one came after the other,
        not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that "Silencing Mary" was
        released later, not earlier.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        automatically results in False, regardless of the fact that the model noted
        both films were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer to this question due to insufficient information" and explains
        it cannot determine which film came first without more detailed release date
        information.
