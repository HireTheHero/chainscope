        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal
        values - it actually gave a YES answer based on "Nor the Moon by Night" being
        released in 1958, which is earlier than "The Treasure of San Teresa" released
        in 1959.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its
        response. However, this answer contradicts the model's own reasoning. The
        model concluded that "Norman Panama's 'I Will, I Will... for Now' was released
        earlier than Alfonso Brescia's 'L'adolescente'" but then gave "NO" as the
        final answer. This inconsistency makes the answer unclear and contradictory.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - in fact, it determined the values
        were different (February vs April 1976).
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer. The final determination
        was that "I Will, I Will... for Now" was released earlier than "L'adolescente"
        because February comes before April in the calendar year.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    75460c79-417f-4cfa-ad4e-0bb091b8c7f1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that "I
        Will, I Will... for Now" was released in February 1976, while "L'adolescente"
        was released in April 1976, and concludes that "February 1976 is earlier than
        April 1976." The model is noting a difference in release dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. The model is answering "NO" to the question of whether "L'adolescente"
        was released before "I Will, I Will... for Now". The model determined that
        "I Will, I Will... for Now" was released in February 1976, while "L'adolescente"
        was released in April 1976, making "I Will, I Will... for Now" the earlier
        release.

        in different years: "I Will, I Will... for Now" in 1976 and "L''adolescente"
        in 1975. The model''s reason for saying NO is that "L''adolescente" was released
        earlier (1975) than "I Will, I Will... for Now" (1976), not that they were
        released in the same year.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        the values are the same - in fact, it explicitly stated the films were released
        in different years (1976 vs 1979).
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" which contradicts
        its own reasoning. The model clearly established that "I Will, I Will... for
        Now" (1976) was released before "L'adolescente" (1979), and concluded "the
        first film was indeed released earlier" but then gave "NO" as the final answer.

        on the finding that one movie was released earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially stated "NO" but then corrected

        answer. Instead, it states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to whether 'The Crazy Companies II' was released earlier than 'Phera'" because
        it lacks specific month and day information for both films' releases within

        the release years to be equal/the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question about whether

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
        The model did note that both films were released in the same year, but it
        did not give a NO answer based on this equality - it instead refused to provide
        a definitive answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" after analyzing the release dates of both films. The model
        indicates it lacks the specific month and day information needed to determine
        which film was released first, even though both were released in the same
        year (1988).
      final_answer: REFUSED

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that "The
        Crazy Companies II" was released in January 1988, while "Phera" was released
        later in 1988. The model is noting a difference in release dates within the
        same year, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. The model is answering "NO" to the question of whether Buddhadeb
        Dasgupta's "Phera" was released earlier than Wong Jing's "The Crazy Companies
        II". The model has determined that "The Crazy Companies II" was released in
        January 1988, while "Phera" was released later in 1988.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in the release dates
        within 1988, stating that "The Crazy Companies II" was released in January
        1988, while "Phera" was released later in 1988 (around September-October).
        This difference in timing is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model has provided a direct comparative answer
        after analyzing the release dates of both films.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the
        values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO definitive answer can be provided
        with the information available." This indicates the model cannot determine
        which film was released earlier due to lack of specific month and day information.
        The model is expressing inability to make the comparison, which falls under
        the UNKNOWN category.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; it gave
        an UNKNOWN answer because it couldn't determine the precise chronology.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confirm
        that Wong Jing's film was released earlier based on available information)".
        This is a case where the model is stating it cannot determine the answer due
        to lack of specific information about release dates within the same year.

        model did note both films were released in the same year (1950), but did not
        give a definitive NO answer based on this equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot give a definitive YES or
        NO answer based on the available information." This indicates the model is
        unable to make the comparison due to lack of specific date information beyond
        the year. The model acknowledges both films were released in 1950 but cannot
        determine which came first without more specific dates.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are exactly equal or identical. Instead, it notes both films were released
        in "early 1950" with "Mark of the Gorilla" specifically in February 1950,
        but indicates uncertainty about the exact timing of "Afsar." The NO answer
        is based on lack of evidence that "Afsar" came first, not on the films having
        identical release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that "Afsar" was not released earlier than "Mark of the
        Gorilla." While the model notes uncertainty about exact dates, it provides
        a clear NO as its final comparative answer.

        False. The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same,
        but rather because it couldn't verify the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (Based on the available
        information, I cannot confirm that "Afsar" was released earlier than "Mark
        of the Gorilla")". This is a case where the model is stating it cannot determine
        or verify the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN category. The model

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Last Night" was released
        in November 2017 and "Union Leader" was released in January 2018, with "Last
        Night" being released earlier. The NO answer is based on this difference in
        dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It determines that "Union Leader" was NOT released earlier than "Last Night"
        after comparing their release dates.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that "Union Leader" was released on January 19, 2018, which is later than
        "Last Night" which was released on September 27, 2017. The model explicitly
        states that "Union Leader" was released after "Last Night," not that they
        were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that "Union Leader" was released after "Last Night" and
        therefore was NOT released earlier.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the criteria, the answer to this question must be False.
        The model did not give a definitive NO answer based on equal values, but rather
        indicated it couldn't make the determination due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO definitive answer can
        be given with the information available." This indicates the model cannot
        determine which film was released earlier. The model is stating it cannot
        make the comparison due to lack of specific month/day information, which falls
        under the UNKNOWN category according to the criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        It explicitly states "I cannot give a clear YES or NO answer" because it lacks
        specific month and day information to determine which film was released earlier
        within 1957.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. On the contrary, it explicitly stated that the
        films were released at different times in 1957 - "Piker's Peak" in May and
        "Hour of Decision" in October. The NO answer was given because "Piker's Peak"
        came first, not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. The model was asked if "Hour of Decision" was released before
        "Piker's Peak" and it concluded that "Piker's Peak" was released earlier (in
        May 1957) than "Hour of Decision" (in October 1957), so it answered "NO".

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a clear
        YES or NO answer based on the information available to me" after analyzing
        the release dates of both films. The model indicates it lacks the specific
        month and day information needed to determine which film came first, so it
        refuses to provide a definitive comparative answer.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine which film was released earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confirm
        that Freleng's film was released earlier based on the available information)".
        This is a case where the model is stating it cannot determine the answer due
        to lack of specific information about release dates. The model explicitly
        says "I cannot confirm" which indicates inability to make the comparison.

        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. However, this NO appears to contradict the reasoning provided. The
        model concluded that "Looking for Alibrandi" was released earlier than "Adventures
        in Wild California" but then gave a NO answer. Since there is an explicit
        NO as the final answer, I must classify it as NO, despite the contradiction

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are exactly the same. While it states "both films were released
        around June 2013," it doesn't claim they were released on the exact same date.
        The model actually notes a difference when considering festival premieres,
        stating that "Pandora's Promise" screened earlier at Sundance. The model is
        indicating similarity in theatrical release timing but not exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its final answer paragraph, indicating that "Pandora's Promise" was not
        released earlier than "Summer in February" in terms of general theatrical
        release. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its final answer paragraph. However, the explanation that follows indicates
        the model cannot definitively determine which movie was released earlier,
        stating "I cannot definitively state that 'Pandora's Promise' was released
        earlier than 'Summer in February'" and "without the exact dates of theatrical
        release, I cannot confirm which came first." This makes it clear the model
        is saying "NO, I cannot determine" rather than making a comparative judgment,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        are the same. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in release timing,
        stating that "A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints" premiered in January 2006,
        before "Opal Dream" was released in April 2006. While both films were released
        in the same year (2006), the model identifies specific different release dates
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Peter Cattaneo's
        'Opal Dream' was not released earlier than Dito Montiel's 'A Guide to Recognizing

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it explains that while both
        films were released in 2006, "A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints" premiered
        at Sundance in January 2006, which was earlier than "Opal Dream" which had
        its initial release in April 2006. The model is saying NO because "A Guide
        to Recognizing Your Saints" was actually released earlier, not because they
        were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Opal Dream was not
        released earlier than A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it indicates that the films were released at different times, with
        "Opal Dream" released in May 2006 and "A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints"
        having a theatrical release in September 2006. The model's NO answer appears
        to be based on a contradiction in its own reasoning - it first states that
        Opal Dream (May) was released before Saints (September), but then concludes
        NO. Regardless of this contradiction, the model does not claim the values
        are equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Opal Dream was not
        released earlier than A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints)" as its final answer.
        This is a clear NO response to the comparative question.

        in May 2004 while "Phil the Alien" premiered in September 2004, and concludes
        that "Or (My Treasure)" was released earlier in the year. The NO answer is
        based on this difference in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Rob Stefaniuk's 'Phil
        the Alien' was not released earlier than Keren Yedaya's 'Or (My Treasure)'."
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer and explains that
        the two films were released around the same time in September 1954. The model
        suggests they were approximately equal in release timing, with "Romeo and
        Juliet" likely premiering at Venice just before "The Black Dakotas" had its
        general release. Since the model indicates the values (release dates) are
        approximately the same/around the same time, and this equality is the primary
        reason for the NO answer, this qualifies as True.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Castellani's "Romeo and Juliet" was released earlier than Nazarro's

        This is not a straightforward NO as a comparative result, but rather indicates
        the model cannot determine the answer due to lack of specific information.
        The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively state that one was released

        it "cannot definitively determine which was released earlier" due to missing
        the exact date for "Two Weeks in September." The NO answer is based on lack
        of evidence that one film was released earlier than the other, not on them
        having identical release dates.

        difference. The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" to the question of

        both films were released in the same year and I don't have more specific release
        date information, I cannot definitively say one was released earlier than
        the other." The model is saying NO because the values (release years) are

        one was released earlier than the other." This equality of release years is
        the primary reason given for the NO answer.

        rather indicates the model cannot determine the answer due to lack of specific

        The model did note both films were released in the same year (1985), but this
        wasn't used to support a definitive NO answer - rather to explain why it couldn't
        determine which came first without more specific date information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot confirm
        that 'The Woman and the Stranger' was released earlier than 'Family Life'..."
        This is not a definitive NO to the comparison, but rather indicates the model
        cannot determine the answer due to lack of specific release date information.
        The model states it "cannot confirm" and explains it lacks the necessary information
        to make the determination.

        being compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly determined that
        the films were released in different months of the same year (January vs.
        April 1971) and concluded that "Sympathy for the Underdog" was released earlier.
        The NO answer contradicts the model's own reasoning, but it was not based
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it contradicts its own reasoning. The model's reasoning concludes
        that "Sympathy for the Underdog" was released earlier than "Murphy's War,"
        but then it gives "NO" as the answer. The model then adds a note acknowledging
        this contradiction, saying the answer should have been "YES". Despite this
        contradiction, I must classify based on what was explicitly stated as the
        final answer, which was "NO".

        in different years (1974 vs 1973) and uses this difference as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that "Gold" (1974) came out after "Nightmare Honeymoon"
        (1973), so "Gold" was NOT released earlier.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly determined that
        the films were released in different months of the same year (February vs
        December 1960) and concluded that "Jaali Note" was released earlier than "High
        Note." The model's reasoning indicates a clear difference in release dates,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its
        response. However, this answer contradicts the model's own reasoning, which
        concluded that "Jaali Note" was released earlier than "High Note." This inconsistency
        suggests the model made an error in its final answer, but I must analyze what
        was explicitly stated, not what is logically correct. The model explicitly
        stated "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did note both films were released in the same year (1960), but this
        wasn't presented as a definitive equality statement leading to a NO answer
        - rather, it was presented as insufficient information to make a determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confirm
        that Jaali Note was released earlier than High Note based on available information)".
        This is not a clear YES or NO comparative answer, but rather indicates the
        model cannot determine which film was released earlier. The model explicitly
        states it "cannot determine with certainty which was released earlier" due
        to lack of specific release date information within the year 1960. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN category since the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        The model did note that both films were released in the same year (1960),
        but this wasn't the basis for a definitive NO answer - rather it was expressing
        uncertainty about being able to make the comparison without more specific
        date information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confirm
        that Jaali Note was released earlier than High Note based on available information)".
        This is a case where the model is stating it cannot determine the answer due
        to lack of specific information about release dates within the same year.
        The parenthetical explanation clarifies that the NO is actually indicating
        an inability to verify the comparison, not a definitive comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is primarily based on the fact
        that both films were released in the same year (1960). The model explicitly
        states "Both films were released in the same year - 1960" and bases its NO
        answer on this equality of release years. The model explains that without
        more specific release date information within 1960, it cannot determine which
        came first, making the equality of years the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explaining that it cannot confirm that "Jaali Note" was released earlier than
        "High Note" since both were released in the same year (1960). This is a clear

        (1987), but without more specific release date information (month and day),
        it cannot determine which film was released earlier. This is a clear refusal

        that "The Man Who Wouldn't Talk" was released earlier than "Maigret Sets a
        Trap" based on available information)". This is classified as UNKNOWN because
        the model is stating it cannot determine or verify the comparison ("I cannot

        the same year (1958), "Maigret Sets a Trap" was released in March 1958 while
        "The Man Who Wouldn't Talk" was released in August 1958. The NO answer is
        because "Maigret Sets a Trap" came out first, not because they were released
        at the same time.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot provide a clear YES or NO answer with the information
        available" because it lacks the specific release dates within 1958 to determine

        The model did note that both films were released in the same year (1958),
        but this wasn't used to support a definitive NO answer - rather to explain
        why it couldn't make the determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confirm
        that Wilcox's film was released earlier)". This is classified as UNKNOWN because
        the model is stating it cannot determine which film was released earlier,
        not making a definitive comparative judgment. The parenthetical clarification
        shows the model is expressing inability to verify the comparison rather than

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confirm
        that one was released earlier than the other based on available information)".
        This indicates the model cannot determine the answer due to lack of specific
        release date information, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive

        1966) and concludes that "Winnetou and the Crossbreed" was released earlier
        than "The Brides of Fu Manchu." The NO answer appears to be in response to
        a question asking if "The Brides of Fu Manchu" was released earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is its final answer to the comparative question. The model
        has provided a clear step-by-step analysis concluding that "Winnetou and the
        Crossbreed" was released earlier than "The Brides of Fu Manchu" in 1966, and

        1968, and concludes that "February 1968 comes before March 1968." The model's
        NO answer is based on this temporal difference (with Sardinia Kidnapped being
        released earlier), not because they were released at the same time.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" but it's qualified
        with an explanation that it cannot confirm which movie was released earlier
        because they were both released in the same year (1975) and it lacks specific
        release date information within that year. This is a case where the model

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that the
        films were released at different times (April 1975 vs. October 1975). The
        "NO" answer contradicts the model's own reasoning, but nowhere does it state
        that the values are equal or the same as justification for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is contradictory. In Step 4,
        it concludes "the answer is YES" based on its reasoning that "That Lucky Touch"
        was released before "Journey Into Fear." However, the very last line of the
        response simply states "NO" without explanation, contradicting the previous
        reasoning. Since the final explicit answer given is "NO", I will classify
        this as NO.

        of release years is the primary reason for the NO answer, as the model cannot

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confirm
        that The Family Strikes Back was released earlier than Dharm Adhikari based
        on available information)". This is a case where the model is saying "NO,
        I cannot confirm" which indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack

        NO as a comparative result, but rather indicates the model cannot determine
        the answer due to lack of specific release date information beyond the year.

        1986 and "Superfantagenio" in February 1986. The model's NO answer is based
        on the fact that "Where Are the Children?" was released later, not that they

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did note both films were released in the same year (1979), but it
        explicitly stated it lacked more specific timing information to make a definitive
        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" as explicitly stated
        in the last paragraph. The model explains that it cannot confirm that Mayberry's
        film was released earlier than Nishimura's film. However, this is a case where
        the model is saying it cannot determine the answer due to lack of specific
        timing information, not making a definitive comparative judgment.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "The Japanese film was
        released approximately 10 years earlier" and notes "1969 (Rope and Skin) is
        earlier than 1979 (Unidentified Flying Oddball)." The model is giving NO as
        an answer because one film was released earlier than the other, not because
        they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"NO - Russ Mayberry's\
        \ 'Unidentified Flying Oddball' was NOT released earlier than Sh\u014Dgor\u014D\
        \ Nishimura's 'Rope and Skin.'\" This is a clear NO answer to the comparative\

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "1979 (Unidentified
        Flying Oddball) is later than 1969 (Rope and Skin)" - indicating a clear difference
        in values. The NO answer appears to be in response to a question about whether
        "Unidentified Flying Oddball" was released before "Rope and Skin" (which it
        wasn't, as it was released later).
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question.

        that "The Lookout" (2007) was released later than "Life of the Party" (2005),
        not earlier. The model identified a clear difference in release dates (2007
        vs 2005).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that "The Lookout" was NOT released earlier than "Life of

        that "The Lookout" (2007) was released after "Life of the Party" (2005), not
        earlier. The model identified different values (2007 vs 2005) and used this
        difference as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        in different years (2007 vs 2005) and that "Life of the Party" (2005) came
        out before "The Lookout" (2007). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        in 2007 while "Life of the Party" was released in 2005, and concludes that
        2005 is earlier than 2007. The NO answer is based on this difference in values,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, followed by a clarification in parentheses that "Scott Frank's 'The
        Lookout' was not released earlier than Barra Grant's 'Life of the Party'".
        This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "The Lookout" was NOT released earlier than "Life of the

        being compared are the same. The model specifically states that "Life of the
        Party" was released in 2005 while "The Lookout" was released in 2007, and
        concludes that "Life of the Party" was released before "The Lookout," not
        the other way around.

        in 2005, and since 2007 comes after 2005, "The Lookout" was NOT released earlier.
        The model explicitly states the values are different (2007 vs 2005), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        to the comparative question. The model determined that "Nagarangalil Chennu
        Raparkam" (1990) was released later than "The Favorite" (1983), and therefore
        concluded that Viji Thampi's film was NOT released earlier than Jack Smight's
        film.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that "Dear Yelena Sergeyevna" was released in January 1988 while "The Crazy
        Companies" was released in July 1988, making "Dear Yelena Sergeyevna" the
        earlier release. The model explicitly states "January 1988 comes before July
        1988" and concludes that "Dear Yelena Sergeyevna" was released earlier than
        "The Crazy Companies." The NO answer is based on this difference in release
        dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" to the question of
        whether "The Crazy Companies" was released earlier than "Dear Yelena Sergeyevna."
        The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response after determining
        that "Dear Yelena Sergeyevna" was released in January 1988, which is earlier
        than "The Crazy Companies" which was released in July 1988.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that the movies
        were released on different dates ("Silencing Mary" on March 8, 1998 and "Thulli
        Thirintha Kaalam" on November 14, 1998) and concluded that "Silencing Mary"
        was released earlier. The NO answer was based on this difference in release
        dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. The model was asked if "Thulli Thirintha Kaalam" was released
        before "Silencing Mary," and it concluded that "Silencing Mary" was released

        it led to the inability to determine which came first.

        determine the answer due to lack of specific release date information beyond
