        The model explicitly notes "both movies were released in the same year" and
        "if only the years are considered, they are the same" as the basis for its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are exactly equal. Rather, it states that "without specific release dates,
        we cannot definitively say one was released earlier than the other just based
        on the year." The model acknowledges both films were released in the same
        year (1988), but the NO answer is due to insufficient information to determine
        the specific order within that year, not because they were released at exactly
        the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explaining that it cannot establish that "The Crazy Companies II" was definitively
        released earlier than "Phera". This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        YES or NO answer based on the available information." It acknowledges both
        movies were released in the same year (1988) but says it cannot determine
        which came first without exact release dates. This is a case where the model

        that one was earlier than the other" due to lack of specific release dates.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model indicates it cannot
        determine which film was released earlier.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and

        The model did note the movies were released in the same year, but this wasn't
        used to support a definitive NO answer - rather to explain why it couldn't
        determine which came first.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is qualified with an explanation that they "cannot confidently
        determine" which movie was released earlier. This indicates the model is saying
        it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information (exact release dates),
        which makes this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO comparative
        result.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
        Even if we had classified the answer as NO, the model does state that both
        films were released in the same year (1988), but it's not giving a NO answer
        because they're equal - it's giving a "cannot determine" response due to lack
        of more precise release date information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that it cannot confirm that "The Crazy Companies II" was released
        earlier than "Phera" based on the available information. However, this is
        not a straightforward comparative NO. The model is actually saying "NO, I
        cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN category according to the
        criteria. The model states "we cannot definitively say that one was released
        earlier than the other without exact dates," indicating inability to make
        the comparison.

        equal as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it states "Both films were
        released in 1988" but then explains "we cannot determine which came first
        purely based on the year alone" and "we cannot confirm it was earlier." The
        NO is based on inability to determine the order, not on confirmed equality
        of release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer must be NO"
        in its conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question of
        whether The Crazy Companies II was released earlier than Phera.

        It states "I cannot definitively answer YES or NO" because it lacks the exact

        In fact, it explicitly states that Hideous! was released on August 19, 1997,
        while Pagaivan was released on September 15, 1997. The NO answer is because
        Pagaivan was released later (in September) than Hideous! (in August), not
        because they were released at the same time.

        1997 and Pagaivan in November 1997), and concludes that "Hideous! was released
        earlier than Pagaivan." The NO answer is based on this difference in release
        dates, not on equality.

        dates (February 14 vs February 3). The model concludes that Mehandi Laga Ke
        Rakhna was released BEFORE The Yuppie Fantasia 3, which is why it answers
        NO. This indicates a difference in values, not equality.

        "The V.I.P.s" premiered in September 1963. The NO answer is based on this
        difference in release dates within the same year, not on equality.

        on March 17, 1999, while Rockford was released on August 6, 1999, and concludes
        that Bad Company was released before Rockford. The NO answer is based on this
        temporal difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        step 6, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question. The
        model determined that Bad Company was released before Rockford (March 17,
        1999 vs. August 6, 1999).

        had a U.S. release on September 20, 1972" while "The Revengers had a U.S.
        release on June 1972". The model notes that "June comes before September in
        the calendar year" and concludes that the first film was released later than
        the second, not that they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final answer: NO" and
        clarifies that "The Strange Vengeance of Rosalie was released later than The

        being compared are the same. While it initially notes both films were released
        in the same year (1972), it then checks specific release dates and determines
        they were released on different dates (September 20 vs June 22). The model's
        NO answer is based on the finding that "The Revengers" was released earlier
        than "The Strange Vengeance of Rosalie", not because they were released at
        the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final answer: NO" at the
        end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question,

        were released at different times - "The Revengers" in June 1972 and "The Strange
        Vengeance of Rosalie" in September 1972. The model's NO answer was based on
        this difference in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model determined that "The Revengers" was
        released earlier than "The Strange Vengeance of Rosalie" (June 1972 vs. September
        1972) and provided this as the basis for its "NO" answer.

        "The Revengers" was released BEFORE "The Strange Vengeance of Rosalie," not
        because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that
        while both films were released in the same year (1975), "Journey Into Fear"
        was released in August 1975 while "That Lucky Touch" was released in September
        1975. The model concludes that "That Lucky Touch" was released later than
        "Journey Into Fear", which is why it answers NO. The model identified a difference
        in release months, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" at the
        end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question,

        same year, we lack enough information to determine if one was released earlier
        than the other." The equality of the release years (both being 1975) is the
        primary reason given for the NO answer.

        are the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Journey Into Fear" was released
        earlier in 1975 (April) than "That Lucky Touch" (September). The model identified
        a difference in release dates within the same year, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two movies. The model determined

        the same year (1986) and this appears to be a key factor in its reasoning.
        The model notes that "both movies were released in the same year" and then
        states it cannot determine if one was "definitively released earlier than
        the other" within that year. The equality of release years is presented as
        the primary reason for the NO answer, with the lack of more specific release
        date information preventing further differentiation.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        were released in the same year (1986), and it states "Both films were released
        in the same year (1986)." The model indicates it cannot determine which came
        first within that year due to lack of exact release dates, but the primary
        reason for the NO answer is that they were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes with "the safest answer is **NO**" when asked if The Family

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "UNCERTAIN" as its final
        answer, not giving a clear YES or NO. It states that "the question cannot

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both movies were released in
        1986 and indicates that they cannot determine which came first without exact
        release dates. The model's NO answer is based on the fact that there is "no
        clear indication that The Family Strikes Back was definitively released earlier
        than Dharm Adhikari." This suggests the model is saying NO because it cannot
        verify one came before the other, not because they were released at exactly
        the same time.

        released in 1986." The model explicitly notes this equality as the reason
        it cannot determine which was released earlier, making equality the primary
        reason for the NO answer. The model does not identify any difference between
        the release times.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether "The Family Strikes Back" was released earlier
        than "Dharm Adhikari". The model provides this answer after determining that
        both films were released in 1986 and noting that without exact dates, it cannot

        Back), and concludes that "Dharm Adhikari was released earlier than The Family
        Strikes Back." The NO answer is based on this difference in release dates,

        then determines that Dharm Adhikari was released on February 14, 1986, while
        The Family Strikes Back's exact date is unclear. The model concludes NO based

        release date, not because they have equal release dates.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "The Jade
        Pussycat" was released "earlier in 1977" than "A Bridge Too Far" (June 15,
        1977). The model is indicating a difference in release dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        In fact, it explicitly states that while both films were released in the same
        year (1977), "The Jade Pussycat" was released in April while "A Bridge Too
        Far" was released in June. The model concludes that "A Bridge Too Far" was
        not released earlier because it came out later (June vs April). This is a
        clear difference in values (different months), not equality.

        dates (March 1977 for The Jade Pussycat vs. June 15, 1977 for A Bridge Too
        Far) and concludes that A Bridge Too Far was not released earlier because
        The Jade Pussycat came out first. The NO answer is based on a difference in
        release dates, not equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (not determinable
        with the given information)." This is a case where the model is indicating
        it cannot determine which movie was released first without more specific information.
        The parenthetical clarification shows the model is rejecting the ability to
        make the comparison due to insufficient data.

        in 1962, Nine Days in One Year premiered on January 31, 1962, while Salvatore
        Giuliano premiered on February 28, 1962. The model concluded NO because Nine
