        different years (1981 vs. 1968) and states that "Kalankini Kankabati" was
        released 13 years earlier than "Asso." The NO answer is based on this difference
        in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explicitly says "Franco Castellano's 'Asso' was not released earlier than

        which is the opposite of what was asked in the question. The model identified
        a clear difference in values (1968 vs 1981) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It clearly compares the release dates of the two films and concludes that
        "Asso" was not released earlier than "Kalankini Kankabati" because "Asso"
        was released in 1981 while "Kalankini Kankabati" was released in 1968.

        "Gold" was released in 1974 and "Nightmare Honeymoon" was released in 1973,
        meaning "Nightmare Honeymoon" was released before "Gold." The model did not
        state that the values (release dates) are equal or the same - in fact, it
        explicitly noted they are different years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model determines that "Gold" was released in 1974 and "Nightmare Honeymoon"

        that Brigham City was released earlier (April 2001) than Asura (September
        2001). The model explicitly states there is a difference in release dates,
        not that they are equal.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explicitly says "Herbert Wilcox's 'The Man Who Wouldn't Talk' was not released
        earlier than Jean Delannoy's 'Maigret Sets a Trap.'" This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        Musketeer" was released in September 2001 while "Gypsy Woman" was released
        in December 2001, indicating they were released at different times.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "YES"
        at the end of its response. The model directly answers the question about
        whether "The Musketeer" was released earlier than "Gypsy Woman" with an explicit
        "YES" as the last word of its response.

        2001 than "The Musketeer" (which was released in September 2001). The model
        is giving NO because "Gypsy Woman" was actually released earlier, not because
        they were released at the exact same time.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, the model concludes that "The Family Strikes Back"
        was released AFTER "Dharm Adhikari" (not at the same time). The model determines
        that "Dharm Adhikari" was released in 1986, while "The Family Strikes Back"
        was likely released in the late 1980s (specifically suggesting 1988), making
        it later than "Dharm Adhikari."

        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the films were released in
        different years (1953 vs 1969) and that "The Intruders" was released 16 years
        earlier than "Hurra, die Schule brennt!" The NO answer is based on this chronological

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the films were released in different
        years (1969 vs. 1953) and concludes that "The Intruders" was released earlier
        than "Hurra, die Schule brennt!" The NO answer is based on a difference in
        values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model directly answers the question
        "Was Werner Jacobs's Hurra, die Schule brennt! released earlier than Lee Robinson's
        The Intruders?" with a definitive "NO" after comparing the release dates.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it believes the
        films were released in a specific order, not because they were released at
        the same time. The model explicitly states that "The Intruders" was released
        "earlier in 1969" while "Hurra, die Schule brennt!" was released in "December
        1969." The model is claiming a chronological difference between the release
        dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Werner Jacobs's film was released earlier than Lee Robinson's film.
        The model directly concludes with "NO" at the end of its response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that the films
        were released in different years - "Hurra, die Schule brennt!" in 1969 and
        "The Intruders" in 1959. The model concludes that the first film was released
        10 years after the second film, not earlier, which is why it answers NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model explicitly says "# Answer: NO" and explains that "Werner Jacobs''s

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the films were released
        in different years (1969 vs 1953) and even calculates that "Werner Jacobs's
        film was released 16 years later than Lee Robinson's film." The NO answer
        is based on a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

        being released approximately 16 years earlier. The model is clearly indicating
        a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response.
        The model determined that "The Intruders" was released in 1953, while "Hurra,
