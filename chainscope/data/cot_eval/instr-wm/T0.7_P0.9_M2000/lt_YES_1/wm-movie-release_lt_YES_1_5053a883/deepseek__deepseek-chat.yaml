        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there was a difference
        in release dates, with Les Mistons being released in 1957 and Tarawa Beachhead
        in 1958. The NO answer was given because one came before the other, not because
        they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with "Answer: NO" as the conclusion. This is a direct comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        release dates (1957 vs 1958) and explicitly states that Les Mistons came out
        before Tarawa Beachhead. The NO is not due to equal values, but rather due
        to a clear temporal difference between the release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Final Answer:
        NO" and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "No, Tarawa Beachhead

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the movies were released
        in the same year. Instead, it explicitly states they were released in different
        years (1958 vs 1957) and concludes NO because Les Mistons was released before
        Tarawa Beachhead. The NO answer is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes "No, Tarawa Beachhead was not released earlier than
        Les Mistons." This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states that the movies were released in different years
        (1957 vs 1958) and uses this difference to conclude that Les Mistons came
        first. The NO is because Tarawa Beachhead came later, not because the dates
        were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result based on
        the release dates it identified.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        Les Mistons was released in November 1957 while Tarawa Beachhead was released
        in October 1958, showing a clear difference in dates. The NO answer was given
        because Les Mistons came first, not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Tarawa Beachhead was not released earlier than

        was released "after" Les Mistons (1957), indicating different values. The
        NO answer was based on this difference in release years, not on them being
        equal.

        that Les Mistons was released in 1957 while Tarawa Beachhead was released
        in 1958, "almost a year earlier." The NO answer is based on this difference
        in dates, not on equality.

        the values (release dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly states different
        dates (January 1, 1990 vs February 8, 1990) and concludes NO because one date
        was earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that The Yuppie Fantasia 3 was not released earlier than

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Awam was released in January
        1987 while Dark Eyes was released later in the same year. This indicates a
        difference in timing, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release
        dates it identified (January 1987 vs. May/September 1987).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found specific
        different release dates (January 1987 vs May 1987), not because the values
        were equal. It explicitly states a temporal difference between the releases.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Dark Eyes was not released earlier
        than Awam, based on specific release dates it identified.

      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in 1987, the model
        explicitly states different specific dates (January 23 vs May 7) and bases
        its NO answer on Awam coming out earlier. The NO is not due to equal dates,
        but because one date is explicitly earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly indicating that Dark Eyes was not released earlier than Awam. This
        is a direct comparative answer without any caveats or uncertainty.

        explicitly states different months (February vs May) and uses this difference
        to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is based on Awam being released earlier
        (in February) than Dark Eyes (in May), not because they were released at the
        same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        Black Caesar. The answer is explicit and comparative.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that the dates were different
        (1976 vs 1977) and used this difference to conclude that The Jade Pussycat
        was released before A Bridge Too Far
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that The Jade Pussycat (1976) was
        released before A Bridge Too Far (1977), showing different values. The NO
        is because A Bridge Too Far was released later, not because the dates were
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that "A Bridge Too Far was not released earlier than
        The Jade Pussycat." This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. The model explicitly states that Green
        Hat was released on April 1, 2004, while Love on the Rocks was released on
        October 26, 2004, and the NO answer was given because Green Hat was released
        earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically indicating that "Love on the Rocks was not released earlier than
        Green Hat". This is a direct comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Dante Lam's
        Love on the Rocks was released earlier than Liu Fendou's Green Hat." This
        is a clear YES answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        release dates (January 2004 vs April 8, 2004) and determining that one was
        released before the other. It does not state the dates are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a comparative conclusion explaining that "Love on the Rocks"
        was not released earlier than "Green Hat"

        2004 vs April 1, 2004) and states that Green Hat was released earlier than
        Love on the Rocks. The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not
        on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion that Love on the Rocks was not
        released earlier than Green Hat.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Penda's Fen (March 1974) was
        released earlier than The Super Cops (June 1974). The NO is based on this
        difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that "The Super Cops was not released earlier than Penda's
        Fen." This is a direct comparative answer.

        explicitly states that Penda's Fen was released on March 21, 1974, and The
        Super Cops was released "later in the same year". The NO answer is based on
        this temporal difference, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the explanation and once as the final answer, indicating that The
        Super Cops was not released earlier than Penda's Fen.

    3f1b54c3-4d04-4aa8-90b1-fe7c9639bdcb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both films were released in
        1974, it identifies a specific difference in release dates (March 21 vs March
        27) and bases its NO answer on Penda's Fen being released earlier. The NO
        is not due to equal values, but due to a clear difference in dates.

        False according to the criteria. The values were actually different (February
        vs April 1962), but this is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality when
        the answer is NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Nine Days in One Year was released
        in January 1962 while Salvatore Giuliano premiered in June 1962, showing a
        clear difference in timing. The NO answer is based on this difference in release
        dates, not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically indicating that "Salvatore Giuliano was not released earlier
        than Nine Days in One Year". This is a direct comparative NO answer.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not
        applicable since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: YES" at
        the end of its response after comparing the release dates of the two movies.'

    692d07bb-4268-4594-b3ad-7ab4654cd3b9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates
        (October 15, 1998 vs November 17, 1998) and indicates that one movie was released
        earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Silencing
        Mary was not released earlier than Thulli Thirintha Kaalam."
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not needed when
        the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        after comparing the release dates and determining that Silencing Mary was
        released earlier.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its step-by-step analysis, making this a clear YES answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values being compared (February vs October
        1998) were not equal anyway.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: YES" after
        walking through its reasoning comparing the release dates of the two films.'
      final_answer: 'YES'

    b4572bd4-32e3-4c22-8149-360579963865:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Thulli Thirintha
        Kaalam (October 14) was released earlier than Silencing Mary (November 9).
        The NO is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that "Silencing Mary was not released earlier than
        Thulli Thirintha Kaalam." This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        False according to the criteria. The values being compared (release dates)
        were different anyway, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: YES" after
        providing a step-by-step comparison of release dates showing Silencing Mary
        was released earlier.'
