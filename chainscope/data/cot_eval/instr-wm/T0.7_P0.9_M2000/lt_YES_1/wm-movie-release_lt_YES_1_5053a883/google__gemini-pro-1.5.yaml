      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the dates were different (1962
        vs 1959) and noted that 1962 is later than 1959
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two movies (1962 vs 1959)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different release
        dates (February vs October), not equal values
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, I Will,
        I Will... for Now was released earlier than L'adolescente" after determining
        specific release months (February vs October 1976)

    6c56b3fe-4d3d-48ed-bfce-c28772b3bf3a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found
        different values (1975 vs 1976) rather than equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two films.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    74e0ecfb-1234-4f56-80d9-db9b2a301869:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (different
        release dates in 1976)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the release dates and determining that "I Will, I Will... for Now" was released
        earlier (February 20) than "L'adolescente" (August 27)
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    9ef42e41-0a3b-4d75-9f2d-f266faf04180:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The model actually found different release
        dates and did not claim the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after determining
        that "I Will, I Will... for Now" was released in February 1976, which was
        earlier than "L'adolescente" released in December 1976.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    a2fc8fec-d53a-402c-81bd-b9fa216da628:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The dates were actually different (March
        vs July 1976), but this is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality when
        the answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the release dates and determining that March 1976 comes before July 1976.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    bd8f8e01-164f-4713-8049-28456c75cc9f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1976, the model
        explicitly states different specific release dates (February 26 vs May 28)
        and uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The NO answer is based
        on finding a difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after determining that L'adolescente was released
        earlier than I Will, I Will... for Now based on specific release dates.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    caa2b18b-be75-478f-83a8-cc4278984f3d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different dates
        (February 27th vs April 29th), not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the release dates and determining that February 27th comes before April 29th
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    cb4ec563-2b30-4bc4-ac71-bb5cf10f1597:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1976, the model
        explicitly states they had different release dates (February 27 vs March 12)
        and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer, not their equality
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that "L'adolescente" was released before "I Will, I Will...
        for Now" based on specific release dates (February 27 vs March 12, 1976)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d97ff62b-2f6e-459a-98c9-aee678b97d90:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the release dates of the two films
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

    23ce1e1a-8656-4651-aeb2-13dbd602e581:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. While the model notes both films
        were released in the same year, this is not relevant since the final answer
        wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        say YES or NO without more specific release date information" and indicates
        it cannot determine the order due to lacking exact dates. This is a clear
        case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    4939935c-6c00-4cb5-9db8-c5a8fb7854e3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        different values (1988 vs 1986) and explicitly states "1988 is later than
        1986." The NO is based on this difference in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and concludes with "Therefore, the answer is NO." This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5cd57034-3e97-4759-a0cc-fd1e858a84f2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly showed that the values were different
        (1988 vs 1987) and used this difference to reach its NO answer. The values
        were not equal or same, so this cannot be classified as a NO due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, making this a clear negative comparative
        result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6e93349f-3012-4881-b23d-d13a713cc883:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the model notes both films were released in 1988, this wasn't used to justify
        a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        say yes or no" and "I cannot answer the question as presented" because it
        lacks specific release dates within 1988 to make the comparison. This indicates
        it cannot determine the answer rather than refusing to compare or giving a
        clear YES/NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    731a98e9-704a-4932-b20a-ec83ae145c51:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model actually
        found different release dates (January vs February 18) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after determining that Phera was released earlier in 1988 than
        The Crazy Companies II.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    9f7be4d9-ff0b-4dec-9cd3-e604ec08f4f8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal
        (March 1988 vs later in 1988).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after comparing the release dates and determining The Crazy
        Companies II was released before Phera.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    a8a182ed-562e-4188-a017-d5ca964b0db8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. While the model
        did note the years were the same (1988), this is irrelevant since the final
        answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains that while both films were released in 1988,
        it needs more specific date information to make a determination.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    b36d54cc-975b-47a7-8d06-8786b716e821:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that 1984 is later than
        1983, indicating a difference in values. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on the values being equal. In fact, the model specifically points out
        that the values are different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and concludes with "Therefore, the answer is NO." This is an explicit NO answer
        based on the comparison showing 1984 is later than 1983.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b929a0af-8fad-4796-a0fe-105e0ad8d569:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal
        (different release dates within 1988)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after determining that The Crazy Companies II was released
        earlier (March 31) than Phera (later in 1988)
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    d4249e74-371c-458f-bc9f-d5d09fefddc4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1988, the model
        does not state they were released at the same time or that equality is the
        reason for the NO answer. Instead, the NO is given because there isn't enough
        information to determine the order (missing Phera's specific release date).
        The model even notes that Phera could have been released earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative result (indicating it cannot definitively
        say one was released earlier than the other), not as a rejection of premises
        or inability to verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        While both films were released in 1957, the model explicitly states that Hour
        of Decision precedes Piker's Peak.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives multiple answers (YES and NO) depending
        on which release date is considered, but ultimately concludes with a final

        2, 1957 is "later than January 1, 1957, and also later than June 1957" (though
        this last part appears logically inconsistent, we must take the model's statements
        at face value without resolving contradictions).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the release dates of both films.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d256778e-8f28-4ec2-aba4-30aee05cc1ce:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that 1957 is later than
        1955, indicating a difference between the values rather than equality. The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the dates and determining that 1957 is later than 1955.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        values (2002 vs 2009) and explicitly stated "2002 is earlier than 2009". The
        NO was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in 2000, the model
        explicitly states different release months (February vs August) and does not
        cite equality as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is because Looking for
        Alibrandi was released earlier, not because they were released at the same
        time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the release dates, indicating that Adventures
        in Wild California was NOT released earlier than Looking for Alibrandi.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both films were released in
        the same year (2000), it explicitly states a difference in timing - Alibrandi
        premiered in February while Adventures in Wild California premiered later
        in the year. Since it identifies a temporal difference rather than equality
        as the basis for the NO answer, this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the release dates.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 2004 is later than 2000, indicating
        a difference in values. The NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer. The answer
        is definitive and not qualified with uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1965, the model
        determined they were released in different months (September vs November)
        and gave NO because Les Bons Vivants was actually earlier, not because the
        dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Les Bons Vivants was released in September while The Nanny was released
        in November, making a clear comparative judgment that The Nanny was not released
        earlier.

        in 1951" and uses this equality as the primary reason for its NO answer, saying
        "Therefore, The River was NOT released earlier than Fanfares of Love." The
        NO is directly based on the films having the same release year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its analysis of the release
        dates. The answer is clearly stated and not qualified with uncertainty or

      explanation_equal_values: The model states "1951 (The River) is not earlier
        than 1951 (Fanfares of Love)" and gives NO as the answer. The NO is based
        on the dates being the same (both 1951), and this equality is the primary
        reason given for the negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, making this a clear NO response to the
        comparative question.

        for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its step-by-step reasoning, making this a clear YES answer despite some

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model doesn't cite equality as the reason - it
        cites insufficient information to determine which came first within the same
        year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (Insufficient information)".
        Since this NO is qualified with inability to determine the comparison due
        to lack of information, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than a
        definitive NO comparative result.

        stating "*The River* was released in 1951. *Fanfares of Love* was also released
        in 1951 (in Germany). Therefore, *The River* was NOT released earlier."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The model's discussion of same-year
        release is irrelevant since it didn't lead to the final answer being NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES" at the end,
        despite earlier reasoning suggesting a "NO" answer. While there appears to
        be some contradiction in the reasoning, we must take the final explicit "YES"
        answer as the model's conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the model does mention that both films were released in 1951 in one scenario,
        this is irrelevant since the final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES/NO answer without clarification" due to ambiguity about which version
        of Fanfares of Love is being referenced. While it mentions what the answer
        would be in one scenario, it clearly refuses to make a definitive comparison
        without clarification.

        in the same year (1951), and this equality is explicitly given as the reason
        for the NO answer ("also released in 1951... meaning The River was NOT released
        earlier"). The NO is directly based on the equal release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with clear reasoning about the release dates. The answer is presented

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly noted that 1958 is later than 1957, showing
        a difference in values. The NO appears to be in response to whether the first
        film came before the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after showing its reasoning steps comparing the release
        dates of the two films.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        that one date (1995) is later than the other date (1994), not because the
        values are equal. It explicitly states "1995 is later than 1994" as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and concludes with "Therefore, the answer is NO." This is an explicit NO answer

        was given because Or (My Treasure) was released earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Or (My Treasure) was released earlier than Phil the Alien, making this
        a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the release dates are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that Or (My Treasure) was released earlier
        (May 2004) than Phil the Alien (September 2004). The NO answer is based on
        this difference in timing, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Or (My Treasure) was released earlier than Phil the Alien, making this

      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted both films were released in
        1954, it did not give a NO answer because they were equal. Instead, it determined
        that one film was released earlier than the other in the US (October vs December),
        and this difference in release dates was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that The Black Dakotas was released earlier than Romeo and Juliet in the US.
        This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        in the same year" and uses this equality as the primary reason for its NO
        answer, explaining that one film was not released earlier than the other because
        they were released in the same year (1954).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its analysis of the release
        years.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model notes that the films were released in the
        same year but explicitly states one could have been released earlier than
        the other within that year, so they're not necessarily equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is
        NO" because it cannot definitively say one film was released earlier than
        the other. Since this is expressing uncertainty about the comparison rather
        than a definitive comparative result, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1954, the model
        specifically identified different release dates (October vs December) and
        stated that "The Black Dakotas was released earlier." The NO answer was based
        on this difference in timing, not on equality of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that The Black Dakotas was released earlier than Romeo and Juliet (comparing
        US release dates of October vs December 1954)

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer because it found a
        clear difference in release dates (February vs November 1971), not because
        the values were equal. It explicitly states one was released earlier than
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that The Bloodstained Butterfly was released earlier (February
        1971) than Quest for Love (November 1971)

        release dates (early 1971 vs later 1971), not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after determining
        that "The Bloodstained Butterfly" was released earlier in 1971 than "Quest
        for Love"

    3f65f30d-1e19-48eb-bc1b-d30f58340ed0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1971, the model
        explicitly noted different release months (February vs September) and used
        this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The NO was not due to equal values,
        but rather because one release date preceded the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that "The Bloodstained Butterfly" was released in February 1971, which is
        earlier than "Quest for Love"'s September 1971 release.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that "Both films were released
        in the same year," this is not the reason for the NO answer. The model explicitly
        states the NO is because Quest for Love was released in July while The Bloodstained
        Butterfly was released in February of 1971, indicating a clear difference
        in release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Quest for Love was released after (not earlier than)
        The Bloodstained Butterfly, making this a clear comparative NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model did not claim the
        values were equal - it actually suggested one film was likely released before
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES" in its final
        step, despite some uncertainty in its reasoning. It specifically states "For
        the purpose of a YES/NO answer... YES."
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the values are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states different release dates (October 1971 vs February
        1971), and this difference is what leads to the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the release dates, making this
        a clear NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that "both films were released
        in the same year," it then determines specific months (September vs February)
        and concludes NO based on this difference, not because the release dates were
        the same. The NO answer is based on September being later than February, not
        on equality of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Quest for Love (September 1971) was released later
        than The Bloodstained Butterfly (February 1971). This is a direct comparative
        answer to whether the first film was released earlier than the second.

        release months (October vs February). The NO answer is based on finding a
        difference, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that "Quest for Love" was released in October 1971, which
        is after "The Bloodstained Butterfly" released in February 1971.

        when the answer is NO
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the release dates and determining that "Two Weeks in September" (February
        1967) was released before "Branded to Kill" (June 1967)

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found
        different release dates (April vs August 1967), not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after walking
        through its reasoning about the release dates, finding that "Two Weeks in
        September" (April 1967) was released before "Branded to Kill" (August 1967)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that "1967 is later than
        1966" - indicating a difference in values was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer. The model
        found specific dates (1967 vs 1966) and made a clear determination.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially notes that both films were
        released in 1967, it does not give a NO answer because they are equal. Instead,
        it gives a NO answer after finding more specific dates and determining that
        one film was released before the other (June vs September 1967).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that "Branded to Kill" was
        released in June 1967, which is earlier than "Two Weeks in September" released
        in September 1967.

        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, providing a direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the model notes both films were released in the same year, this is irrelevant
        since the final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        say YES or NO" and indicates it needs more information about exact release
        dates within 1981 to make a determination. This is a clear case where the
        model indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1981, the model
        explicitly states they were released on different dates (April 17 vs October
        23) and uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The NO answer is
        based on the dates being different, not being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Kalankini Kankabati was released earlier than Asso
        (April vs October 1981)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both movies were released
        in the same year (1981), it found specific release dates showing they were
        released on different dates (April 10 vs October 22). The NO answer was given
        because Asso was released later, not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and concludes that
        "Asso was NOT released earlier than Kalankini Kankabati" after finding specific
        release dates showing Kalankini Kankabati was released in April while Asso
        was released in October of the same year.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted both films were released in
        1981, it identified a specific difference in release months (May vs January)
        and this difference, not equality, was the basis for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Asso was released after Kalankini Kankabati (May 1981 vs January 1981)

        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (May vs October
        1981).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after comparing the release dates and determining that May
        1981 comes before October 1981.

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1981, the model
        explicitly states they were released on different dates (January 9 vs October
        23) and concludes NO because Kalankini Kankabati was released earlier, not
        because they were equal. The model specifically notes a difference in timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Kalankini Kankabati was released earlier than Asso in 1981. This is a
        clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in 1981, the model
        found specific release dates (January 23 vs April 24) and determined they
        were different, with one being earlier than the other. The NO answer was not
        due to equal values, but because one was released before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Kalankini Kankabati was released earlier than Asso, making this a clear
        comparative NO answer.

        vs January) and gives this difference as the reason for the NO answer, not
        their equality
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that Asso was released later (in August) than
        Kalankini Kankabati (in January)

        in fact, it explicitly stated "1981 is later than 1952", showing a clear difference
        between the dates. The NO answer appears to be given despite identifying this
        difference, not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, making this a clear NO response to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (April vs
        August 1997).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Pagaivan
        was released earlier than Hideous!" after determining Pagaivan was released
        in April 1997 and Hideous! in August 1997.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both films were released in
        1997, it explicitly states that more specific information would be needed
        to determine which came first within that year. The NO answer appears to be
        due to inability to determine the order rather than explicitly stating they
        were released at the exact same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a statement
        about inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9486f4bf-5df3-4dcd-a002-1480eaefeff3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. While the model
        did note the films were released in the same year, this is irrelevant since
        the final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer" and explains that without more specific release date information,
        it cannot determine which came first. This is a clear refusal to make the
        comparison.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not
        applicable since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "YES" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both movies were released in
        1997, it doesn't state this equality is the reason for the NO answer. Instead,
        it indicates that without more specific date information, it cannot definitively
        say YES. The NO appears to be due to insufficient information rather than
        confirmed equality of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Pagaivan was released earlier than Hideous!
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (2015
        vs 2016) and states "2016 is later than 2015" - the NO is based on this difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the dates, making this a definitive NO response to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly noted that the years were different
        (2016 vs 2015) and used this difference to reach its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after determining that Natural Born Pranksters (2016) was released
        later than Pawno (2015).

        is based on this difference, not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

    4847737e-f859-4593-b9de-3321ef1c7e11:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a final answer of NO, it did
        not state that the values being compared were equal. In fact, it explicitly
        noted different release dates (April 1, 2016 vs April 1, 2015 and May 6, 2016)
        and discussed their temporal relationship. The NO answer appears to contradict
        the model's own reasoning rather than being based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final one-word
        answer, which directly contradicts its own step-by-step reasoning that concluded
        "YES". Despite this contradiction, we must take the final explicit "NO" answer
        as the model's conclusion per the instructions to not resolve contradictions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not indicate the values were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly noted that 2016 is later than 2015, showing a clear
        difference between the dates. The NO answer was based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the release dates of both movies.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model identifies different years (2016 vs 2015)
        and does not state that the values are equal. The NO appears to be based on
        this difference in dates rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after comparing the release dates, making this an explicit NO answer.

        fact, it explicitly noted that 2016 is later than 2015, indicating a difference
        between the values. The NO answer appears to be given despite finding a difference,
        not because the values were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after comparing the dates 2016 and 2015.

        results in False according to the criteria. The fact that the model noted
        they were released in the same year but different months is not relevant since
        we only evaluate this question when the final answer is NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that "both films were released
        in the same year," this is not given as the primary reason for the NO answer.
        Instead, the model states NO because "it's possible, but not confirmed without
        more information." The model explicitly acknowledges they could have different
        release dates within the same year, so it's not treating them as having equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it adds a parenthetical note about uncertainty. Since it gives a clear
        NO as its comparative conclusion (rather than just stating it cannot determine),
        this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        be needed to determine if one was released earlier in the year than the other"
        and "it's possible one was released earlier." The model is not using equality
        as the reason for its NO answer, but rather seems to be indicating uncertainty
        about relative timing within the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found
        different values (1981 vs 1982) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both films were released in
        1969, it explicitly states a difference in timing (May vs September 1969)
        and gives this difference as the reason for the NO answer, not because they
        were released at the same time
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that The Guru was released earlier in 1969 than Me and My
        Brother

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model actually
        found a difference in timing (1968 premiere vs 1969 release) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after determining
        that Me and My Brother predated The Guru based on its 1968 festival premiere
        versus The Guru's 1969 release.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values check only applies when
        the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        analysis, making this a clear YES answer despite noting some ambiguity in
        the wider release dates.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model actually found a
        difference in release timing, with Me and My Brother premiering in September
        1968 and The Guru in April 1969.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Me and My Brother was released
        earlier than The Guru.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the model does note the films were released in the same year, this is irrelevant
        since the final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO" and explains that more information would be needed about specific
        release dates within 1969 to make the comparison. This is a clear case where
        the model indicates it cannot determine the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found the releases
        were at different times (September 1968 vs April 1969), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after determining

    e15c85cc-fa6d-4d2c-bc12-16554f0a8233:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both films were released in
        1969, it does not base its NO answer on them being released at exactly the
        same time. Instead, it states it's "unlikely" one was earlier and suggests
        multiple possibilities including that The Guru could have been earlier or
        they could have been released at the same time. Since equality is not explicitly
        stated as the reason for the NO answer, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Me and My Brother was released earlier than The Guru. This
        was a clear comparative NO answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    fe64f027-53cd-4f05-bfb1-8de7c775443f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The dates were actually different
        (April vs September), but this is irrelevant since we only evaluate for equal
        values when the answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the release dates and determining that "The Guru" was released earlier (April)
        than "Me and My Brother" (September) in 1969.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the values are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that 1978 is earlier than 1982, showing a clear
        difference between the values. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        of release dates and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1977 is earlier
        than 1978, showing a clear difference between the dates. The NO answer appears
        to be based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer. The answer
        is definitive and based on comparing specific dates (1977 vs 1978).

        1981, showing a clear difference between the dates. The NO answer was based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two movies (1978 vs 1981). This is
        a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in the same year (1978),
        the model explicitly states different months (May vs October), indicating
        they are not exactly the same. The NO answer appears to be based on this difference
        in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the release dates of the two movies.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as an answer because it found different
        values (1978 vs 1981) and determined one was earlier than the other, not because
        the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly found that the dates were different
        (1977 vs 1978) and used this difference to make its determination. The NO
        appears to be in response to whether La Carapate was released earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the release dates and determining that Hardware
        Wars was released earlier than La Carapate.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted both films were released in
        2003, it found specific dates showing they were not exactly equal (July 29
        vs August 8), and this difference was the basis for the NO answer, not equality

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both movies were released in
        the same year (2003), it identifies specific different release dates (September
        9 vs June 3), making this a clear case of different values rather than equality
        being the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave specific different dates (July 8, 2003
        vs January 28, 2003) and did not state they were equal. The NO answer appears
        to be because Gang of Roses was released earlier, not because the dates were
        the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it found Gold was released
        AFTER Nightmare Honeymoon (December vs November 1974), not because the dates
        were equal. It explicitly noted a difference in release timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer, but not because the
        values were equal. In fact, it explicitly noted that the dates were different
        (2012 vs 2001), stating "2012 is later than 2001"
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never claimed the values were equal - it stated it couldn't find one of the
        values to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer the question. Therefore, I cannot say YES or NO." This indicates it
        cannot make the comparison due to missing information about one film's release
        date.

      explanation_equal_values: The model found different values (2012 vs 2001) and
        noted that "2012 is later than 2001". The NO answer was not due to equal values,
        but rather due to finding a clear difference between the dates.

        in fact, it explicitly noted that 2012 is later than 2001, showing a clear
        difference in values. The NO answer appears to be based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative

        after determining that Jaali Note was released later (October) than High Note
        (May)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether the model
        discussed equal values
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the release dates and determining that High Note was released before Jaali
        Note

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The model actually found different release
        dates (April 1 vs May 5) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the release dates and determining that Jaali Note was released before High
        Note within 1960
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    5619b9be-a749-4624-acf9-d5f61ee84dd6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in release dates (High Note in May vs Jaali Note in October) and gives this
        difference as the reason for the NO answer, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that High Note was released earlier in the year than Jaali
        Note.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5d2b6f90-f012-467b-a41a-b9b1d80962c1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both films were released in
        1960, it explicitly states different release dates (May 7 vs October 28) and
        concludes that High Note was released earlier. The NO answer is based on this
        difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that High Note was released earlier than Jaali Note. This
        is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False, regardless of the fact that the model noted
        the years were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        say YES or NO" and indicates that further research would be needed to determine
        the relative timing. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly found different release dates (May 7, 1960 vs
        November 4, 1960) and stated that High Note was released earlier than Jaali
        Note.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that High Note was released earlier than Jaali Note. This is a clear comparative
        NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted that both films were released
        in the same year (1960), it found specific release dates showing High Note
        was released on May 7 and Jaali Note on June 10. The NO answer was based on
        this difference in dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that High Note was released earlier than Jaali Note. This is a clear comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False. While the model did note both were released
        in the same year, this is irrelevant since the final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer" after noting it cannot determine which came first. This is a clear
        refusal to make the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the release dates and finding
        that Sky Full of Moon was released in March while Cruise of the Zaca was released
        in November.

        in the same year," it then specifies different months (October vs November
        1952), indicating they are not exactly equal. The NO answer appears to be
        based on this difference in release dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and finding that Sky Full of Moon was released

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions both films had a general
        release in 1990, this equality is not given as the reason for the NO answer.
        Instead, the NO answer appears to be given due to insufficient information
        to make a determination ("cannot provide a definitive answer without more
        information"). The equality of the general release year is mentioned as part
        of the analysis but is not stated as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially shows uncertainty and considers
        different scenarios, but ultimately gives an explicit "NO" answer at the end,
        even though it includes caveats about needing more information. Since we're
        instructed to take the explicit final answer, and the model clearly states
        "**NO**" as its conclusion, this should be classified as NO.

    c7f928c7-fe63-4a38-a13f-114b537ef33a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, while the model notes
        both films were released in 1962, it doesn't use equality as a reason for
        its answer - instead it states it needs more specific date information to
        make a determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the order due to needing more
        specific release date information. Since the model states it "can't definitively
        say one was released before the other," this is effectively stating it cannot
        make the determination, making this an UNKNOWN response despite the "NO" at
        the end.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    cd31dd5d-7585-471e-8c4f-efbf0321d872:

        this as False according to the criteria, regardless of the model noting that
        both films were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite some reasoning that might suggest otherwise. We must
        take the explicit final answer as stated.

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1966, the model
        explicitly states different specific dates (November 17 vs December 16) and
        uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The NO is not based on the
        values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, determining that The Brides of Fu Manchu
        was released earlier (November 17) than Winnetou and the Crossbreed (December
        16)

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both films were released in
        1966, it identifies specific different months (December vs October), making
        them not equal. The NO answer is based on this difference in release dates,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the release dates.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly notes a difference in release dates (June vs December
        1966) and states that one was released earlier than the other. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1966, the model
        explicitly states different months (October vs December) and does not claim
        the release dates are the same. The NO answer is given because The Brides
        of Fu Manchu was released earlier, not because the dates are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is clearly given as a comparative result based on its step-by-step
        analysis showing that The Brides of Fu Manchu was released earlier (October
        vs December 1966).

        found specific release dates and determined they were different (Oct 26 vs
        Dec 15). The NO answer was based on finding a difference in dates, not on
        them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that The Brides of Fu Manchu was released earlier (Oct 26) than Winnetou and

        in the same year" and uses this equality as the primary reason for its NO
        answer, explaining that one cannot have been released earlier than the other
        without more specific date information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result based on the release dates
        being in the same year.

        in the same year," it went on to identify specific months showing they were
        not released at the same time (June vs October). The NO answer was based on
        finding that one film was released earlier than the other, not because they
        were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" after determining that "The Brides of Fu Manchu" was released

        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that The Revengers was released before The Strange Vengeance of Rosalie. This
        is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it found The Strange Vengeance
        of Rosalie was released after The Revengers (October vs June 1972), not because
        the values were equal. The dates are different, and this difference is the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that The Strange Vengeance of Rosalie (October 1972) was

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly noted that 1975 is later than 1943, showing a clear difference
        in values. The NO answer was not based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both films were released in
        1986, it does not give the NO answer because they were released at exactly
        the same time. Rather, it gives NO because without more specific date information
        within 1986, it cannot confirm that The Family Strikes Back was released earlier.
        The equality of the year is not given as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, and this was a direct answer to whether one film was released
        earlier than the other, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        the question only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains that while both films were released in 1986,
        more precise information would be needed to make the comparison. This is a
        clear refusal to make the comparison without more detailed information.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but also indicates that one of the movies doesn't exist, making comparison
        impossible. According to the criteria, when a model rejects the premises of

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The model also explicitly noted different
        release dates (March vs December 1974), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the release dates and finding that The Super Cops was released before Penda's
        Fen (March vs December 1974)
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found the releases
        were at different times (January vs March), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after determining
        that The Super Cops was released earlier than Penda's Fen (January vs March)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the model notes both were released in 1974, this wasn't used as justification
        for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES/NO answer" and indicates it cannot determine which was released first
        without more precise dates. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both were released in 1974, the model explicitly
        states different months (March vs May) and does not claim the release dates
        are equal. The NO answer appears to be based on finding that Penda's Fen was
        released earlier, not on equal dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Penda's Fen was released earlier than The Super Cops
        (March vs May 1974)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1974, the model
        found specific release months (March vs May) and based its NO answer on this
        difference, not on equality. The values were explicitly different, not the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Penda's Fen (March 1974) was released before The Super Cops (May 1974)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (1979 vs 1997) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the release dates and finding that 1979 is earlier than 1997.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that 1979 is later than
        1958, indicating a difference in values rather than equality. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the dates 1979 and 1958.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model found specific different values (1979 vs
        1968) and based its NO answer on 1979 being later than 1968. The values are
        not equal, and equality was not the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        of release dates and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its comparative answer.
        The answer is definitive and not qualified with uncertainty or inability to
        verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (1979
        vs 1968) and indicates that "1979 is later than 1968" - it's giving NO because
        of a difference in values, not because they are equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        a reason for a NO answer - it was expressing uncertainty about the precise
        timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (cannot be determined with the
        available information)" which indicates it cannot make the determination.
        When a model states it cannot determine or verify something, this should be
        classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1969, the model
        explicitly states they were released on different dates (June 6 vs December
        19) and uses this difference to determine that The Intruders was released
        earlier. The NO answer was not due to equal values, but due to finding a clear
        difference in release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states different release dates (August 1979
        vs February 1980) after initially noting they were both from 1979. The NO
        answer appears to be based on these different dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" after determining that The Little Dragons was released in August
        1979 while Pirates of the 20th Century premiered in February 1980.

        release dates (May 29, 1998 vs July 16, 1998) and explicitly says "Bandhan
        was released earlier than A Hero Never Dies". The NO answer is based on this
        difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that Bandhan was released
        earlier than A Hero Never Dies.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6ceac593-d2e9-4e47-99d0-0c9bfba62edb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different release
        dates (May vs July), not equal values
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, A Hero Never
        Dies was released earlier than Bandhan" after determining specific release
        months (May vs July 1998)
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    7ccc98ce-ff60-4a92-96eb-23e50d8701d8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different release dates
        (May 29, 1998 vs July 30, 1998) and indicates that Bandhan was released before
        A Hero Never Dies.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Bandhan was released before A Hero Never Dies, making
        this a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8fc3eb0b-aeb7-41c1-9c91-32eccf664198:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer was NO, it did not
        indicate the values were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated that Bandhan
        was released earlier (May 29, 1998) than A Hero Never Dies (July 17, 1998)
        and used this difference as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the release dates and determining that Bandhan
        was released earlier than A Hero Never Dies.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    913b2ab5-4184-4436-8f8c-5a02108bb564:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in dates (July 30 vs May 29) and concludes NO because A Hero Never Dies was
        released later than Bandhan
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step analysis
        and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer, indicating
        that A Hero Never Dies was not released earlier than Bandhan (because it was
        released later)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. While it notes both films were released in 1954 and potentially
        on the same day, it actually suggests Top Banana may have been released earlier
        (Feb 1) than The Stranger's Hand (sometime in Feb). The NO answer appears
        to be based on the conclusion that The Stranger's Hand was not released earlier,
        rather than on the dates being exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (based on
        available information)" as its final comparative answer. While it expresses
        some uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a clear NO answer rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    7cc0c201-3084-4931-aac5-24b41bd47a5b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1954, the model
        explicitly states they were released in different months (February vs March)
        and uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The NO is not due to
        equal values, but rather due to a clear temporal difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Top Banana was released before The Stranger's Hand
        (February vs March 1954)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The model actually found the films were released
        in different months (February vs November 1954), but this is irrelevant since
        we only evaluate equality when the answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after comparing the release dates of the two films.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (different
        dates in February)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after determining
        that The Stranger's Hand was released before Top Banana based on specific
        premiere dates (February 11 vs February 25, 1954)

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The model actually found the films
        were released in different months, not that they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after analyzing
        the release dates and determining that The Stranger's Hand's Italian premiere
        predated Top Banana's release.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both films were released in
        the same year and specifically in February 1954, and this equality is the
        primary reason for the NO answer. The model explicitly notes they were released
        "in the same year" and that it's "highly unlikely one demonstrably predates
        the other," indicating the NO is based on their equal timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two films.

    1ba867f1-1771-4bbf-be55-f1df6a4d04c1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model noted the films
        were released in the same year but suggested likely different timing within
        that year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "the answer is likely YES,
        but not definitively" - while it leans towards YES, it explicitly qualifies
        this as uncertain without more precise dates. This hedging and lack of definitive
        answer makes this an UNKNOWN response.

        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model did not
        claim the values were equal - it actually found a difference in release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing

        the model did note both were released in 1988, this is irrelevant since the
        final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot determine the order due to lacking
        specific release dates within 1988. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question. Additionally,
        while the model notes both were released in 1988, it doesn't use equality
        as a reason for its answer - rather it cites inability to determine the specific
        timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (I cannot confirm it
        was released earlier)" which indicates it cannot determine the comparison.
        This is a case where the model is expressing inability to verify/determine
        the comparison, making it an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative
        result.

        being released in 1988 is irrelevant since this question only applies to NO
        answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its

        in the same year" and uses this equality as the primary reason for its NO
        answer. While it mentions that further research might reveal differences within
        the year, its NO conclusion is based on the equality of the release years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (indicating one film was
        not released earlier than the other), not as a rejection of ability to determine
        or rejection of premises.
