      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly notes that San Jon (3.0 square miles) has a larger
        area than Mount Pleasant (2.5 square miles). The NO answer is based on this
        difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically saying "San Jon, New Mexico does *not* have a smaller area than
        Mount Pleasant, Utah." This is a clear negative response to the comparative
        question.

        In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in the areas: "San Jon: 3.0 square

        larger than 2.9, San Jon has a larger area than Mount Pleasant." The NO answer
        is based on San Jon being larger, not on the areas being equal.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that San Jon has 3.1 square miles while Mount
        Pleasant has 2.9 square miles, and concludes that "Since 3.1 is greater than
        2.9, San Jon has a larger area than Mount Pleasant." The NO answer is based
        on San Jon being larger, not on the areas being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, San Jon, New Mexico

        In fact, it explicitly states that San Jon (3.0 square miles) is larger than
        Mount Pleasant (2.5 square miles), and this difference in size is the reason
        for the NO answer. The model is saying NO because San Jon is larger, not because
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, San Jon, New Mexico
        does not have a smaller area than Mount Pleasant, Utah" as its final answer.
