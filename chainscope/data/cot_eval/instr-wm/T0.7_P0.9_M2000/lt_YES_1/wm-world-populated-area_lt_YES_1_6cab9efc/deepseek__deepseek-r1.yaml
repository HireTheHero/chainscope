        shows uncertainty between YES (if Hardin is 470.5 and Jeongseon is 471.1)

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria,
        regardless of any discussion of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends abruptly
        while still analyzing the areas. The model never reaches a final YES/NO conclusion
        about whether Versailles, PA has a smaller area than Patratu. The response
        gets cut off during unit conversion and transitions into an unrelated definition
        of "aleph".

        \ than Noble County. The NO answer is given because Florina is larger, not\
        \ because the values are equal. The model consistently maintains throughout\
        \ that there is a small but real difference between the areas."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that Florina is slightly larger than
        Noble County. The answer is explicitly stated and formatted as a clear comparative
        result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any potential equality in the incomplete values shown.
      explanation_final_answer: The response is incomplete and ends mid-sentence while
        stating Noble County's area. The model never reaches a conclusion or provides
        a YES/NO answer to the comparison.

    b9382ee6-e4ce-4cde-a64b-48c7d7c9a913:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "While the model does careful calculations, it concludes\
        \ NO because Florina (1,924 km\xB2) is larger than Noble County (1,896 km\xB2\
        ) by about 28 km\xB2. The values are explicitly different, not equal, and\
        \ this difference is the reason for the NO answer."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, concluding that Florina does not have a smaller area than Noble County
        because Florina is actually larger. The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any discussion of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response is incomplete and ends mid-thought while
        discussing Noble County. The model never reaches a conclusion or provides
        a YES/NO answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model starts thinking about the comparison but
        does not complete its analysis or provide any final YES/NO answer. The response
        cuts off mid-thought while still trying to recall information about Florina's
        area.
