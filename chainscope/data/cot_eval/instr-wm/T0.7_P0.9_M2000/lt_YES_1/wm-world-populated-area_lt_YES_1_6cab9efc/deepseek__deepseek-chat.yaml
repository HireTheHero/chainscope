        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        Brooktrails to Walsingham, Norfolk (after choosing to focus on the Norfolk

        difference in values (4.5 vs 140 square miles), not because the values were
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a single definitive answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the areas are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Suffolk County is larger than County
        Galway and provides different values (2,373 vs 2,197 square miles). The NO
        answer is based on Suffolk being larger, not on the values being equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that Suffolk County does not have a smaller area than
        County Galway because Suffolk County is larger (2,373 sq miles vs 2,197 sq

        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model didn't claim the areas were
        equal - it stated one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating that Tilouthu
        doesn't exist/has no defined area, making comparison impossible. While it
        does state "NO" as its final answer, this is a case where the model is rejecting
        the premise rather than making a valid comparison, so this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

        all.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" as its final answer,
        it immediately qualifies this with uncertainty and explicitly states "the
        question cannot be answered definitively" due to lack of information about
        one of the locations. This indicates it cannot make a valid comparison, making
        this effectively a rejection of the ability to determine the answer.

        one of the areas at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately qualifies it
        by saying this is due to insufficient information and inability to verify
        one of the locations. This is effectively rejecting the premises of the question
        since one location may not exist, making this an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive
        NO comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately explains this
        is because one location cannot be verified to exist, making the comparison
        impossible. This is a rejection of the premises rather than a comparative
        result, so it should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        this is because it "cannot confirm" the comparison, making this a case where
        the model rejects the premises/indicates it cannot determine the answer.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model does conclude with "NO", it explicitly
        states it "cannot determine" the comparison and that one location may not

        never claimed the values were equal - in fact, it stated it couldn't determine
        one of the values at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Cannot be determined
        (NO clear YES or NO answer)" and explains it cannot make the comparison because
        one location (Tilouthu) cannot be identified. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        classification criteria as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        made.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately explains this
        is because one location (Tilouthu) doesn't exist or can't be verified, making

        the areas were equal. Instead, it concluded that Avarua is smaller than Ballenger
        Creek, indicating a difference in values. The NO answer was given because
        the comparison went in the opposite direction of what was asked, not because
        the values were equal.

        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
