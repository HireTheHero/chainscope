        there is a difference in values (914 square miles vs 479 square miles) and
        indicates Randall County is larger. The NO is not due to equal values but
        due to Randall County being larger.

        answer was based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the areas, finding that Tanah Merah District (3,932 sq km)
        is larger than Jeff Davis County (862 sq km).

      explanation_final_answer: The model ultimately provides an explicit "NO" answer
        at the end of its response, despite expressing uncertainty throughout. While
        the model discusses uncertainty, it does commit to a final "NO" answer rather

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the areas are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly stated that Tugela Ferry would likely have a larger
        area than Bettles, Alaska. The model estimated Tugela Ferry to be "a few square
        kilometers to tens of square kilometers" while Bettles was estimated at "less
        than a square kilometer," indicating a clear difference in size.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that Tugela Ferry does not have a smaller area
        than Bettles, Alaska. The model made a clear directional comparison, determining
        that Tugela Ferry is likely larger.
