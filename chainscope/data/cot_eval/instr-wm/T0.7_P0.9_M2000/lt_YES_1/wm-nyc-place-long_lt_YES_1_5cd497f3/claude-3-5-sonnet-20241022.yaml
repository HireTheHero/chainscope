      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Building 6 being
        east of Building 7, not because the buildings are in the same location. It
        explicitly states a directional difference between the buildings' positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        directional explanation (Building 6 is east of Building 7, not west)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    28ef15cb-36ff-47e9-93bd-3c5336f9e1c2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Building
        6 is east of Building 7, not because the buildings are at the same location.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Building 6
        is actually located EAST of Building 7"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the buildings and determining
        that Building 6 is east (not west) of Building 7.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    2edaffc4-95c3-441d-813a-5663bbc507ec:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a difference
        in position (Building 7 being west of Building 6), not because the buildings
        are in the same location. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference based on street numbers (10 vs 46 Madison Street).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final conclusion
        after walking through its reasoning about the relative positions of the buildings
        based on street numbers.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    8de512ac-c44e-463d-b75e-db599f6a6af5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the buildings are in the
        same location or equal in position. Instead, it explicitly states Building
        6 is positioned to the EAST of Building 7, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly concludes with "Therefore: NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating Building 6 is not west of Building
        7 (in fact stating it''s to the east)'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a6e71acf-24ad-40eb-a62b-9677e2cc5d18:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the buildings
        are in the same location - it explicitly states they are in different positions
        with Building 6 being east of Building 7. The NO is due to the opposite directional
        relationship than what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative directional result, stating that Building 6 is east (not west)
        of Building 7.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    afa7856a-8b00-4a53-960c-02ea193bbc32:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Building 6 being
        "positioned to the east of Building 7" - indicating a directional difference,
        not equality. The model does not state that the buildings are at the same
        location or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the buildings, making a definitive
        comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ce3af38a-a964-4b94-a046-ca6187e519ef:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        buildings are in the same location. The model explicitly states that Building
        6 is located EAST of Building 7, indicating a clear directional difference.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        in its conclusion, providing a definitive comparative answer about the relative
        positions of the buildings. The answer is not qualified with uncertainty or
        inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    fd398a00-3b42-4a1b-8f1b-0c5bccf985cc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the positions are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that "Building 6 is positioned to the EAST
        of Building 7", indicating a difference in position. The NO answer appears
        to be based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis, and this NO is given as a direct comparative
        result (not a refusal or inability to determine)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Elton Playground
        being east of the NYPD Aviation Unit, not because the locations are at the
        same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Elton Playground is east (not west) of the NYPD Aviation
        Unit. This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different positions,
        with ELTON PLAYGROUND being "to the north and EAST" of the NYPD AVIATION UNIT.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the relative
        positions of the two locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly noted differences in their positions, stating that
        Elton Playground is east of the NYPD Aviation Unit and described different
        relative positions (center/north vs southeastern coast)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations' positions
      final_answer: 'NO'

    9987cb20-5cb4-4be6-a072-2733db95d025:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly noted a directional difference, stating "Elton Playground
        is actually slightly west of the NYPD Aviation Unit location". Even though
        the difference is described as "slight", any stated difference means this
        is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations and determining that Elton
        Playground is "slightly west" of the NYPD Aviation Unit.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, with Pratt Playground being "north and
        slightly east" of the synagogue. The NO is based on the direction being different
        from what was asked (not west, but rather north and east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis. The answer indicates Pratt Playground is "NOT west" of the synagogue,
        but rather "north and slightly east."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly describes them as being in different positions (one
        more central/western, one more eastern) and provides this difference as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear directional explanation (Pratt Playground is east of
        the synagogue)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - rather, the NO was given because one location
        was determined to be north (not west) of the other. The model explicitly states
        a directional difference between the locations
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this
        conclusion (that one location is north, not west, of the other)

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference in position, with Pratt
        Playground being "EAST and NORTH of Brighton Beach". The NO is based on the
        locations being in opposite directions from what was apparently asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on geographical
        analysis showing that Pratt Playground is east and north of Brighton Beach,
        not west.

        is not west of the guard shack." This is a clear NO answer to a comparative
        directional question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b5bff034-8d36-4f5c-89b2-c97a7e0dee4f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it concludes that the garage would be east
        of the guard shack, indicating a specific directional difference between the
        locations. The NO appears to be rejecting that one location is west of the
        other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct conclusion after
        its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c08deab9-32e0-45bc-9e92-26811dc5fdf5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its conclusion that
        the garage would be east of the guard shack, not west of it. It indicates
        a specific directional difference between the locations (garage being east,
        not west), rather than stating the locations are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct comparative result
        based on its reasoning about the relative positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    0108be97-c867-4523-b070-df26d5dfa155:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model states they are "roughly on the same
        north-south alignment," this is not stating they are exactly equal/identical.
        Additionally, the model notes they are on different streets (27th vs 11th),
        indicating they are not at the exact same location. The NO answer is based
        on neither being "significantly west" of the other, not because they are exactly
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and provides
        a clear comparative result, stating that neither location is significantly
        west of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6275a078-e4fb-4578-951c-51eebd7a72a2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        STRAUS HOUSES is east of FDNY RESCUE COLLAPSE 1, indicating a difference in
        position. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about uncertainty or inability
        to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    66169360-7507-46ea-9ba9-2f06f78dc1be:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were exactly
        equal or identical in position. Instead, it noted they had "similar east-west
        positioning" but were at different north-south positions. The NO answer was
        based on neither being "significantly west" of the other, not because they
        were exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations' positions
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6bfb888a-f131-43ed-910a-b64bde92d9c2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states that one location is
        east of the other (Straus Houses on Avenue D is east of FDNY Rescue on Avenue
        A/B), indicating a difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly explains
        that Straus Houses Community Center is not west of FDNY Rescue Collapse 1,
        providing a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    712ebc31-77eb-4eab-8afe-f09158a50208:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, with Straus Houses being "further east" and FDNY Rescue 1 being
        "slightly more inland (west)." The NO answer is based on this difference in
        position, not on the locations being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations and concluding
        that Straus Houses cannot be west of FDNY Rescue 1 since it is "further east."
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7655fcd2-1010-476c-aa91-54db62f1abc7:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are "in roughly the same east/west
        position" and that "neither can be definitively said to be west of the other."
        This indicates the model is saying NO because it considers their east/west
        positions to be effectively equal/the same, making this the primary reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    77d3628d-a346-463b-be5e-f84c529a6419:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that STRAUS HOUSES is closer to
        the East River while FDNY RESCUE COLLAPSE 1 is "slightly more inland/west",
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on STRAUS being
        east of FDNY, not on them being in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and clearly
        states that "STRAUS HOUSES COMMUNITY CENTER is not west of FDNY RESCUE COLLAPSE
        1", providing a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "STRAUS HOUSES is slightly
        further east than FDNY RESCUE 1", indicating a difference in location, even
        if slight. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        and explicitly concludes "STRAUS HOUSES is NOT west of FDNY RESCUE 1", making
        this a clear negative comparative answer.

        other. Even though the model appears to contradict its own reasoning (first
        saying Manhattan is west of Brooklyn, then concluding the opposite), we must
        take the stated conclusion at face value without trying to resolve the contradiction.

        west of the Panama Mission. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it explains that Clinton Hill
        Library is in Brooklyn (east) while the Panama Mission is in Manhattan (west),
        indicating a difference in location. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Clinton Hill
        Library is not west of Panama Mission to the UN." This is a clear NO answer

        (Clinton Hill Library being east of the Panama Mission), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states one location is east
        of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (Clinton Hill

        being equal/same/identical - rather, it explicitly states they are in different
        positions (one east of the other). The NO is because the relationship is opposite
        to what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, making a direct comparative judgment based on relative geographic

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - in fact, it explicitly described them as being in different positions
        (Whitestone as "further east" and Briarwood as "more centrally located").
        The NO answer was given because Whitestone is east of Briarwood, not because
        they're in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences
        (one location being east and the other west), not because the locations are
        equal or the same. It explicitly states that one location is east while the
        other is west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after walking through its reasoning about the relative
        positions of the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states that Brownsville Post
        Office is EAST of the school, indicating a difference in location. The NO
        is based on the opposite directional relationship, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a definitive comparative answer that Brownsville Post Office is not located
        west of the school. The answer is explicit and directional.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        location is "further east" than the other, not because they are equal or the
        same. It explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Brownsville Post Office
        is further east, not west, of the school.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the final answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated they are in different
        positions, with one being in the eastern part and one being more western.
        The NO was because their relative positions are opposite to what was asked
        (east instead of west)
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        as a clear comparative result, indicating that Brownsville Post Office is

        after comparing the locations and determining that Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge
        is east (not west) of CCB School Flushing.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating Jamaica Bay is EAST of Flushing), not because the locations are at
        the same position. The model explicitly indicates there is a difference in
        east/west positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion after analyzing the relative positions, indicating Jamaica Bay
        Wildlife Refuge is not west of CCB School Flushing.'

    71249451-159c-4800-b053-ea66023b3b71:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states Jamaica
        Bay is east and south of Flushing, indicating different positions. The NO
        was given because the direction was different (east) from what was asked (west)
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating
        Jamaica Bay is east, not west, of the location)
      final_answer: 'NO'

    84f0ae59-0049-4923-9054-3639c4d3e34f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the locations being
        in different positions (with Jamaica Bay being EAST and SOUTH of Flushing),
        not because they are in the same location. The model explicitly states a directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        to support this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ca0abaf5-e166-4d76-9dbc-668bd839a21e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge is "slightly
        EAST of Flushing" and bases its NO answer on this directional difference.
        Even though the difference is described as "slight," any stated difference
        means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge is east (not west) of CCB
        School Flushing. This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d392abeb-0d7f-495b-88cc-513863986c87:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a directional difference ("Jamaica Bay is actually EAST of CCB School
        Flushing"). The NO is not based on equal positions, but rather on finding
        that one location is east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations, determining that
        Jamaica Bay is east of CCB School Flushing.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly stated Jamaica Bay is
        east of Flushing, indicating different positions. The NO was due to the direction
        being opposite to what was asked (west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, after analyzing the relative positions and
        determining Jamaica Bay is east (not west) of the location in question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (one is east of the other), not because they are equal
        or the same. The model explicitly states that Cambria Heights is "further
        east than Bayside."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the relative positions of the two schools, determining that
        Cambria Heights Academy High School is east (not west) of PS 41 Crocheron.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found a directional
        difference (one location being west of the other), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it explicitly stated that Cambria Heights is EAST of Bayside and concluded
        NO because one location was east (not west) of the other. The NO was based
        on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is east of the other (not west as apparently asked in the original
        question), not because the locations are equal. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the relative positions of the two schools, making a definitive
        comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and explains that it cannot make a definitive
        determination about the relative positioning. This is a clear case where the
        model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        the locations were equal/same/identical - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot definitively say..."
        which indicates it cannot determine the relative positions. This is a case
        where the model is expressing inability to verify/determine the comparison,
        making it an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative result.

        automatically results in False. The model did not make a NO comparison based
        on equal values - it refused to make any comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (one is east of the
        other), not because they were at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Betances Houses
        is east of Galileo Playground, not west.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - it explicitly states they are different, with one being
        east of the other. The NO is because the direction is opposite to what was
        asked (east instead of west)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - BETANCES 4 HOUSES
        BUILDING 3 is not west of GALILEO PLAYGROUND" and provides a clear directional
        comparison stating it is "actually east of it"

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Betances 4 is east of Galileo Playground
        (475 E vs 425 E), indicating a difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their
        relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to insufficient information. This indicates an inability

        made a comparison of equal values since it refused to make any comparison
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I need to abstain from
        providing a YES/NO answer" and "I cannot provide a confident YES or NO answer"

    4d5e7863-acbb-48af-8095-1d60f068adbb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined the
        locations were in opposite positions from what was asked (Lafayette Senior
        Club is east, not west, of the Conservatory). It did not state the locations
        were equal or the same - in fact, it explicitly noted they were in different
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final answer after reasoning about the relative positions of Brooklyn
        and Manhattan locations.

      result: 'NO'
    581d7f0b-e494-4e3e-bf54-c52eeed6afe5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that one location is east of the
        other, giving this directional difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:
        NO" as its final conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer based on
        geographical reasoning.'

    8eae5938-c2f1-4a2d-8159-0b60d3fb9a9a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states they are different,
        with one being EAST of the other. The NO is given because one location is
        determined to be EAST when the question asked about WEST.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical
        reasoning.

      result: 'NO'
    8edc96c8-46da-4096-8fa8-c4bacb10f6d2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it gave NO because one location is in Brooklyn (which
        is east) and therefore cannot be west of the Manhattan location. The reason
        for NO was based on relative positions being different, not being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    9cb3798b-1508-4324-b657-c5fde3d5dd7c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (one location being east of the other), not because the locations have equal
        positions. The model explicitly states that Brooklyn is east of Manhattan
        and therefore Lafayette Senior Club must be east, not west, of NY Conservatory
        of Music.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after walking through its geographic reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional reasoning
        (Manhattan being west of Brooklyn) rather than the locations being equal/same/identical.
        It explicitly states one location must be west of the other, indicating a
        difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a directional reasoning
        about why one location must be west of the other.

    c21d5bac-cd91-4607-b69a-df32561b2294:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that one location CANNOT
        be west of the other because Manhattan is west of Brooklyn. The answer is
        based on geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one location is EAST of the
        other, indicating a directional difference. The NO was given because the relationship
        was opposite to what was being asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        as a clear comparative result, indicating that the first location is not west

        longitude," it immediately follows with "If anything, East Rockaway Inlet
        is slightly to the east." Since it notes this directional difference (even
        if slight), this is not a case where equality is the primary reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (East Rockaway Inlet

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they are "roughly aligned
        on a similar longitudinal line," it also explicitly states that East Rockaway
        Inlet is "slightly east" of Queensboro CC. The presence of any directional
        difference, even if described as slight, means this is not a case of equal
        values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        EAST of the other. The NO is given because the actual relationship (EAST)
        is opposite to what was being asked about (WEST).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, making a direct comparative judgment about the westward relationship
        between the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        due to their locations in different boroughs.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"

        that the Bronx location would be east of the Brooklyn location. The NO answer
        was given because the premise was incorrect (asking if one was west when it
        was actually east), not because the locations were equal.

        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that one location
        is east of the other, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was
        given because the model believed the relationship was in the opposite direction
        of what was asked.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the response never
        indicated the locations were equal - it actually emphasized uncertainty about
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (we cannot definitively
        determine...)" which indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        location data. This is a case where the model is stating it cannot determine
        the relationship, making this an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative
        result.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it states a directional difference,
        saying one is east of the other. Any stated directional difference, even if
        factually incorrect, means this is not an equality-based NO.

    e8b6703f-541a-4a85-9dd1-9830ecd62538:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model states they are "roughly aligned east-west,"
        it also specifies that "the tube might be slightly more eastern." Since it
        indicates a directional difference (even if slight), this is not a case where
        the NO answer was given because the locations are exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 14 STREET/CANARSIE
        TUBE is not located west of the Pakistan Consulate" as its final comparative
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly stated there
        was a difference in position (173rd St vs 156th St) and concluded NO because
        one location was east of the other, not because they were at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        as a clear comparative result, indicating that one location is not west of

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly stated
        that one location (Detective Keith L Williams Field House) is east of the
        other location (August Martin High School), indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, based on its step-by-step analysis showing

    740a5850-838b-4675-ade9-af5ff50b5836:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (one location is east of the other), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states that 173rd Street is
        east of 157th Street, indicating different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after explaining
        that Detective Keith L Williams Field House is east of (not west of) August

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it explicitly stated that one location was east of the other (Detective
        Keith L Williams Field House is east of August Martin High School). The NO
        answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support
        this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is east of the other (173rd Street is east of 157th Street), not
        because the locations are equal. It explicitly notes a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that one is east of the other,

        in fact, it explicitly identifies a difference in their positions, noting
        that one location is at 173rd Street and the other at 156th Street, concluding
        that one must be east of the other. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after working through the locations and their relative positions. This
        is a direct NO answer to the comparison question.

    d6a7aef9-403b-4b9e-9c5d-b3978bccc7de:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a difference
        in positions (173rd St vs 156th St) and concluding one location is east of
        the other, not because the locations are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (one location is east of the other), not because the locations
        are equal. It explicitly states that 173rd Street is further east than 157th
        Street.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - in fact, it explicitly found a difference in their positions, noting
        that one location is at 173rd Street and the other near 156th Street, concluding
        the Field House is east of the school. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or have equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly states
        that one location is east of the other ("It's actually east of it"), indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a clear "NO" answer in its conclusion,
        stating "NO - Glenmore Ave over LIRR Bay Ridge is NOT west of College of Mt
        St Vincent Gate House." This is a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the east-west positioning
        is "similar," it explicitly states there is a difference, with Bay Ridge being
        "slightly more towards the west." Since it identifies a directional difference,
        even if small, this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its
        analysis, providing a clear comparative answer based on its reasoning that
        Bay Ridge is "slightly more towards the west."

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Glenmore Ave is "slightly
        more westward" than the College of Mt St Vincent. Even though it's described
        as "slightly," any stated difference means the NO answer wasn't due to equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after its step-by-step
        analysis, providing a direct comparative answer about the locations' positions.

    b36879c3-7e54-42b5-871e-ef049c440a63:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are at different positions (Glenmore Ave in eastern Brooklyn vs
        College in western Bronx), not because they are at the same location. The
        model explicitly states that Glenmore Ave is EAST of the College location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its
        step-by-step analysis, providing a clear comparative answer that Glenmore
        Ave is east of the College location, not west of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is east of the other (indicating a difference in position), not because
        the locations have equal coordinates. The model explicitly states "Glenmore
        Ave is actually EAST of the College of Mt St Vincent Gate House" as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after explaining that Glenmore Ave is actually east of the College
        of Mt St Vincent Gate House, making this a clear comparative answer.

    ba3696f1-8ad8-4d60-8cd0-8d63593d6fa7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that while both are western in
        their boroughs, the Bronx location (Mt St Vincent) is further west than the
        Brooklyn location (Bay Ridge). The NO answer is based on this difference in
        position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" twice - both
        in the explanation and as a final standalone answer. The model makes a clear
        comparative judgment that the first location is NOT west of the second location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states they are in different
        positions, with the farm being east of the church. The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical reasoning that
        Red Hook Community Farm is east, not west, of St. Peter's RC Church.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that Red Hook Community Farm is "roughly
        on the same longitude (or even slightly west)" of the comparison point. Since
        it indicates there might be a slight westward difference, this is not a case
        of exact equality being the reason for the NO answer. Even though similarity
        is mentioned, the possibility of being "slightly west" means we cannot classify
        this as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice,
        both in its reasoning and as its final answer. This is a definitive comparative
        answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not relevant when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES, Red Hook
        Community Farm is located west of St. Peters RC Church." This is a clear,

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined Red Hook Community
        Farm is east of St. Peters RC Church, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying that Red Hook Community Farm is WEST of St. Peters RC Church. The NO
        answer is given because the relationship is reversed from what was asked,
        not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times as its
        final comparative answer, including "The answer is NO" as its final line.

        is east of the other ("It's actually east of it"), indicating a difference
        in position. The NO is based on the direction being opposite to what was asked,
        not because of equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined that Van Cortlandt Park Arthur Ross Nursery is EAST of
        PS 7, which is the opposite of what was being asked (if it was WEST). The
        model identified a specific directional difference.

        final comparative answer, after walking through the geographical reasoning
        that led to this conclusion. The answer is definitive and based on a directional
        comparison.

        aligned on an east-west basis," this is not presented as exact equality and
        is not the primary reason for the NO answer. The model's reasoning is that
        both locations are on the east side of Manhattan, making it impossible for
        one to be west of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that one location is east of the other. The
        NO is because the relationship is opposite to what was presumably asked (west
        vs east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative explanation that Bronx Mathematics Preparatory School is east,
        not west, of Millennium Art Academy. This is a clear negative comparative
        result.

        are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that one school is
        east of the other, indicating a clear directional difference between their
        locations. The NO was given because the relationship is in the opposite direction
        of what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis
        of the locations. The model determined that the first school is east of the
        second school, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        Bronx Mathematics Prep is "slightly to the EAST" of Millennium Art Academy,
        indicating a difference in location, even if slight. The NO answer was given
        because the direction was east instead of west, not because the locations
        were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it explicitly states that
        one location is east of the other ("It's actually east of it"), indicating
        a directional difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Hunters Point South
        Park Playground is NOT located west of Red Balloon Learning Center" as its
        final conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal/same/identical
        - instead, it explicitly stated one location was east of the other, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that USTA South Gate is east of
        Edenwald Houses, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - USTA South Gate is

    43cfe998-ba43-4be1-9ffc-334a1347af22:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions,
        with USTA being "significantly to the east" and Edenwald Houses being "more
        westerly in position". The NO answer is based on this difference in position,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, USTA South Gate is not
        west of Edenwald Houses Building 12. It is east of it." This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        positions, with USTA being east of Edenwald. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after walking through its reasoning about the relative
        locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - it explicitly states they are different, with USTA South
        Gate being east of Edenwald Houses. The NO is because the relationship is
        in the opposite direction (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically addressing the comparative directional relationship by stating
        "USTA South Gate is not west of Edenwald Houses - it's east of it"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations are
        equal - it explicitly stated that USTA South Gate is EAST of Edenwald Houses,
        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO answer
        was given because the actual direction (east) is opposite to what was asked
        (west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, after reasoning about the relative positions
        of the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that USTA South Gate
        is east of Edenwald Houses, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO is based on the opposite direction being true, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice in its conclusion,
        providing a definitive comparative answer that USTA South Gate is not west
        of Edenwald Houses. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly reasoned that one location must be east
        of the other (Queens being east of the Bronx). The NO answer appears to be
        based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after providing its reasoning about the relative positions
        of the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states they are in different locations
        (Queens vs Bronx) and concludes that one is east of the other, not that they
        are at the same location. The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that one location is east
        of the other, indicating a directional difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative directional conclusion that St. Joan of Arc is east (not west)
        of Fordham University Rose Hill Gymnasium.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3e3fa0d9-bde7-4f75-b4f1-9ca339973c0b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states they are in different
        positions, with St. Joan of Arc being east of Fordham University Rose Hill
        Gymnasium. The NO is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and provides
        a clear directional explanation that St. Joan of Arc is east, not west, of
        Fordham University Rose Hill Gymnasium.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying Queens locations are "always east of Bronx locations". The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after providing its reasoning about the geographic locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly stated that Queens is east of the Bronx
        and concluded NO based on this directional difference. The NO answer was based
        on one location being east of the other, not because they are at the same
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that St. Joan of Arc is not west of Fordham
        University Rose Hill Gymnasium.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that St. Joan of Arc is east, not west of Fordham's gymnasium), not
        because the locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference between the locations.

        aligned with" Blessed Sacrament Church. The mention of "roughly aligned" as
        an alternative to "east" indicates some potential variation, not exact equality.
        Additionally, this rough alignment is presented as one possibility alongside
        being "east," not as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - both in the

        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (Pink Houses
        Building 3 is not west of Blessed Sacrament Church)" as its final comparative

        "slightly east" as a possibility means it's not claiming exact equality as
        the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Prospect
        Park Flower Garden Pavilion is located west of Luria Academy of Brooklyn."
        This is a clear, direct YES answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (that the Flower Garden Pavilion is east of Luria Academy). The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that "Luria Academy is further
        west than the Flower Garden Pavilion." The NO answer is given because the
        Flower Garden Pavilion is east of Luria Academy, not because they are at the
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the east-west positions of the two locations. The answer is
        definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it indicates Luria Academy is "roughly aligned with or slightly west
        of" the Pavilion, suggesting a difference (even if small) rather than equality.
        The NO answer appears to be because the Pavilion is not west of Luria Academy,
        not because they're at the same longitude.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (one is east of the other), making this
        a clear case where the NO is based on a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative directional result, saying "NO - Prospect Park Flower Garden Pavilion
        is not located west of Luria Academy of Brooklyn. It is east of it."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that the locations are on opposite sides of the East
        River with Astoria Houses being east of Wagner Pool. The NO is based on the
        opposite directional relationship from what was asked, not because the locations
        are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        directional explanation that Astoria Houses is east of Wagner Pool, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or identical in position. Instead, it indicated that Astoria Houses would
        be "roughly parallel or slightly east" of Wagner Pool, which actually indicates
        a difference (even if slight) in positioning. The NO answer was given because
        the premise was wrong in the opposite direction, not because the locations
        were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the geographical positions of the two locations.

        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Mall Eighteen is EAST of
        Beach Channel Park, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Mall Eighteen is not
        located west of Beach Channel Park" as its final comparative conclusion. This
        is an explicit NO answer to the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative directional conclusion that Hotel Utica is not west of Kirby Forensic
        Psychiatric Center
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4bfd3ab4-36dc-436c-aec8-d8447b9357e9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it actually stated they must be different, with Hotel Utica being
        east of Kirby Forensic Psychiatric Center due to their locations in different
        boroughs. The NO was based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it concludes NO because it determines Hotel Utica must
        be east of Kirby Forensic Psychiatric Center, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined Hotel Utica was east of (not west of) Kirby Center. The
        model explicitly states a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a directional reasoning
        (east vs west) for its conclusion.

    ae25690f-6b99-4945-af6e-78962be3c4b1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - instead, it explicitly states that the locations are in different boroughs
        and concludes that Hotel Utica must be east (not the same location) of Kirby
        Forensic Psychiatric Center. The NO is based on the opposite directional relationship,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response based
        on its geographical reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or have equal coordinates. Instead, it explains that Hotel
        Utica must be east of Kirby Forensic (indicating a difference in position),
        and therefore cannot be west of it. The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that Hotel Utica is not west of
        Kirby Forensic. This is a direct NO answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    fecedd03-b2f4-4267-bf59-f7055d0f023e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference, with Manhattan being
        west of Brooklyn. The NO is because the premise conflicts with the known geographical
        arrangement, not because the locations are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on the geographical arrangement
        of the boroughs.

        (stating it's "east of it" rather than west), not on the locations being equal/identical.
        Even though the reasoning is contradictory, the model is clearly describing
        a directional difference rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear directional explanation. While it appears to contradict
        itself (first saying west, then east), we are instructed to not try to resolve
        contradictions.
