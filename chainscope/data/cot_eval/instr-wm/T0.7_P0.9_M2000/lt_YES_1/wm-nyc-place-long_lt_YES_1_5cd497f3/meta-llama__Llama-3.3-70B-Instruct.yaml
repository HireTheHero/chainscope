    1cb34f4e-ca8b-496a-b944-a67efca3fd65:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the relative
        positions, it does not state that the buildings are in the same location or
        have equal positions. The NO answer appears to be based on insufficient information
        rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides this
        clear NO answer (not "NO, I cannot verify" or similar), we should classify
        this as NO rather than UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the buildings are in the same location or that they
        have equal positions. The NO answer appears to be based on inability to verify
        the westward relationship rather than on equality of position. The model never
        claims the buildings are in exactly the same spot or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative answer rather than a statement
        about inability to determine. While the model expresses uncertainty in its
        reasoning, it still provides a definitive NO as its final conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    56872cef-3a1a-4292-8266-d6fa763dedde:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the buildings are in
        the same location or have equal coordinates. Rather, it gives a NO answer
        based on speculation about numbering systems and typical layouts, while acknowledging
        uncertainty. The NO is not based on the locations being identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        despite expressing uncertainty throughout. While the model discusses limitations
        and lack of information, it ultimately provides a clear NO rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating it cannot determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the buildings are in the same location or that they
        are equal/identical in position. The NO answer appears to be based on the
        model's analysis of typical building layouts rather than any statement of
        equality between the positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response. While the model expresses uncertainty in its
        reasoning, it does provide a clear NO as its final comparative answer, not
        a refusal or inability to determine.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expressed uncertainty about the locations,
        it did not state that the buildings are in the same location or that they
        have equal coordinates. The NO answer appears to be given due to insufficient
        information rather than because of equal positions. Since the final answer
        was NO but equality was not stated as the reason, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        despite expressing uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides a clear
        NO as the comparative result, we classify this as NO rather than UNKNOWN,
        even though the model indicated uncertainty in its reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the buildings are in the same location or have equal positions. Instead,
        the NO appears to be based on inability to verify the westward relationship
        due to lack of information about the buildings' locations. The model does
        not cite equality of position as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response. While the model expresses uncertainty and
        indicates it cannot determine the relative positions with certainty, it still

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the relative
        positions of the buildings, it does not state that the buildings are in the
        same location or have equal positions. The NO answer appears to be based on
        insufficient information to confirm the westward position rather than on the
        buildings having equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        making this a clear NO response. While the model expresses uncertainty in
        its reasoning, it still provides a definitive NO answer rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the buildings are in the same location or have equal
        coordinates. The NO answer appears to be based on insufficient information
        to verify the westward relationship, not because the locations are identical
        or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer
        after its analysis, making this a clear NO response. While the model expresses
        uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a definitive NO answer rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the buildings are in
        the same location or have equal positions. Instead, it expresses uncertainty
        about their relative positions and gives a NO answer without explicitly stating
        they are equal/identical/the same. The NO appears to be based on insufficient
        information rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide this
        definitive comparative answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Rather, it expresses uncertainty about their relative positions
        and indicates it lacks sufficient information to make a determination. The
        NO answer appears to be based on this lack of information rather than any
        assertion of equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. While it expresses uncertainty about making the comparison without
        detailed spatial information, it does provide a clear NO as its final comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model provides a "NO" answer in a box at
        the end, the explanation leading up to it indicates that it doesn't have enough
        information to make a determination ("without access to real-time mapping
        data or specific knowledge"). The model essentially rejects its ability to
        make the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN case.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it emphasizes that it lacks information about their
        relative positions and cannot determine their exact locations. The NO answer
        appears to be given due to inability to verify the westward relationship,
        not because the locations are determined to be at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. While it expresses uncertainty throughout the analysis, it ultimately
        provides a clear NO answer when pressed for a yes/no response, rather than
        refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine. Since it gives this
        definitive NO answer rather than stating it cannot verify or determine, this
        should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        the locations were equal or the same - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, but it also clearly indicates it "cannot definitively conclude their
        east-west relationship" and that "a definitive answer cannot be accurately
        provided." This makes it a case where the model indicates it cannot make the
        comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the relative
        positions, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead,
        it discusses various possible relative positions and concludes NO due to lack
        of specific information, not because the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty about the actual layout. Since
        it provides a clear NO as its comparative result (rather than saying it cannot
        determine), this should be classified as NO.

        information to make the determination, not because the locations are at the
        same position. The model discusses uncertainty about their relative positions
        rather than equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on uncertainty about FDNY
        Rescue Collapse 1's location and reasoning about Manhattan's geography. The
        model mentions that Straus Houses are on the Lower East Side and discusses
        relative positions, but never claims the locations are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Rather, it reasons that since Straus Houses is
        on the Lower East Side, and FDNY Rescue Collapse 1 is unlikely to be even
        further east, Straus Houses cannot be west of FDNY Rescue Collapse 1. The
        answer is based on relative positions being different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model uses phrases like "would lean towards
        NO" and includes some uncertainty, it ultimately provides a clear final answer
        of "NO" in bold at the end of its response. This is a direct comparative answer,
        not a refusal or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on reasoning about relative
        positions, suggesting the Straus Houses Community Center would be east (not
        west) of the FDNY location. The uncertainty expressed about exact locations
        doesn't change that the model is making a directional comparison rather than
        claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"

        or the same. In fact, it discusses various possible relative positions and
        bases its NO answer on assumptions about typical Manhattan geography and likely
        locations. The NO is not based on the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, after a lengthy analysis. While it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning,
        it does provide a clear NO as its final conclusion.

        the locations are different - specifically stating that Straus Houses Community
        Center is east of FDNY Rescue Collapse 1. The NO is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical, but rather because they have different relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that the Straus Houses Community
        Center is likely east of FDNY Rescue Collapse 1's probable location, indicating
        a difference in position. While there is uncertainty in the exact locations,
        the model's reasoning is based on one location being east of the other, not
        on them being in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is presented as a comparative result based on analyzing the relative
        positions of the locations, not as a rejection of the premise or inability
        to verify.

        or the same. Instead, it suggests they are in different locations, with Straus
        Houses being on the east side and FDNY likely being more central/western.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, but the
        reasoning indicates it cannot determine the locations or their relative positions,
        stating "I would need actual addresses or more details to provide an accurate

        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't verify one
        location's position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it is "unable to provide

      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO", it explicitly
        states it "cannot accurately determine their relative positions" and "a definitive
        answer cannot be precisely given." The model only provides NO because it was
        forced to give a YES/NO answer despite stating it cannot make the determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Clinton Hill Library
        is east of the Panama Mission (indicating different positions), not because
        they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment that the Clinton
        Hill Library is not west of the Panama Mission to the UN.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" in its final answer
        section, it immediately qualifies this by saying it cannot determine the relative
        positions without specific location data. This makes it clear that the model
        is indicating it cannot make the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN
        criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        Whitestone is east of Briarwood ("Whitestone would be east of Briarwood, not
        west"), indicating a difference in location. The NO is based on the opposite
        directional relationship, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether WHITESTONE VOLUNTEER AMBULANCE is west of YOUNG ISRAEL

        east-west variations. The NO answer is based on the reasoning that the relationship
        is "more north than west" rather than because the locations are at the same
        longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to
        whether Yankee Stadium is west of the High School for Health Careers and Sciences

        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same as the reason for
        its NO answer. The NO appears to be based on inability to confirm the westward
        relationship rather than on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its
        analysis. While it expresses uncertainty in reaching this conclusion, it still
        provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it
        cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions without more data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but explicitly states
        this would be "speculative" and that it's "challenging to provide a definitive
        YES or NO without more specific geographic data." This indicates the model
        cannot determine the answer, making this effectively a statement of inability

        it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but throughout the response it indicates it cannot determine the relative
        positions without access to maps or specific coordinates. The model states
        "I would need to either consult a map or have more specific information to
        give a definitive YES or NO answer." Since the NO answer is given while explicitly
        stating it cannot determine the answer, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines the Brownsville
        Post Office is east of the school (not west), indicating a difference in location.
        Even though there is some uncertainty in the exact location of the school,
        the model still bases its NO answer on a directional difference rather than
        equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it arrives at NO based on reasoning about
        relative positions, specifically that Brownsville's eastern location makes
        it unlikely to be west of the school. The model acknowledges uncertainty about
        exact locations but makes its determination based on likely relative positions,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after its analysis. While it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it arrives at NO through reasoning about
        the general geography of Brooklyn and the likelihood of relative positions,
        suggesting the post office is probably not west of the school. The model actually
        emphasizes uncertainty about exact locations throughout its response, but
        still concludes NO based on geographical reasoning rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold at the end of its response, making this a clear NO answer. While the
        model expresses uncertainty in its reasoning, it still provides a definitive
        NO as its conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on reasoning about relative
        positions, suggesting the post office would likely not be west of the school
        due to their locations in eastern Brooklyn. The model notes uncertainty but
        makes a directional judgment, not an equality statement.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, making a directional judgment based on its reasoning about
        the locations, even though it acknowledges some uncertainty in the exact locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty and discusses
        the proximity of the locations, it never explicitly states that the locations
        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it suggests they are in neighboring
        areas and could be slightly different depending on exact addresses. The NO
        answer appears to be based on the analysis of relative positions rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in its analysis. Since it provides this
        clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine,
        we classify this as NO.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions without more data.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" in its "Hypothetical
        Answer" section, it heavily qualifies this as speculative and explicitly states
        it lacks the necessary location data to make a determination. The response
        emphasizes multiple times that it cannot make the comparison without precise
        addresses. This makes it clear that the model is indicating it cannot determine
        the answer rather than providing a definitive NO.

        being equal/same - it explicitly states that the post office is "more likely
        east" and that Pitkin Avenue is "generally east of Irving Avenue". The NO
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it does
        not state that the locations are equal/identical/the same. Instead, it suggests
        the Brownsville Post Office is likely east of the school (i.e., different
        positions), basing this on neighborhood layouts and street grids. The NO answer
        is given because the question asked if the post office was west, and the model
        concluded it was east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer, though
        it adds some uncertainty by mentioning that "consulting a detailed map would
        be ideal." Since it still provides a clear NO as its comparative conclusion,
        this counts as a NO answer rather than UNKNOWN.

        part". The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Based on these

        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "ANSWER: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        locations, it does not base its NO answer on the locations being equal or
        the same. Instead, it suggests the hotel is likely east of the park (indicating
        different positions), making this reasoning based on a directional difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it acknowledges uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides a clear
        NO as its comparative conclusion (not a "NO, I cannot determine" or similar
        disclaimer), this counts as a NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - in fact, it explicitly indicated they were in different positions,
        with the hotel being east of the park. The NO answer was given because the
        hotel was determined to be east, not because the locations were identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning, indicating that the hotel
        is not west of the park (stating it would be east instead).

    f46bb40f-09f8-4137-b035-dbc8db144ea6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on geographical reasoning
        about the relative positions in Queens, suggesting the hotel is likely not
        west of the park given JFK Airport's southeastern location. The model expresses
        uncertainty but does not base its NO answer on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response, making this a clear NO answer. While the model

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that BRAVO is east of ALPINE (on 6th Avenue
        vs 5th Avenue). The NO is because the relationship is opposite to what was
        asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the locations, determining that BRAVO is east
        of ALPINE, not west.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient information to
        make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model ends with "NO" but earlier states it "cannot
        provide a definitive YES or NO answer" and lacks "specific information". This
        indicates the NO is due to inability to determine rather than a comparative
        result, making this an UNKNOWN response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it suggests they are in different areas (one possibly
        in central/southern Brooklyn and the other in Bay Ridge), and gives NO as
        an answer based on this assumed difference in location. The uncertainty in
        exact locations doesn't change that the model is suggesting a difference rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response, despite expressing uncertainty about having enough information.
        Since we must take the model's final stated answer at face value, regardless
        of any caveats or contradictions, the answer is YES.

    bf5ee910-238e-4e87-a0df-2b55f2b0195c:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model did not cite equality of values as a reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives "NO" as a placeholder answer, but
        explicitly states this is without having access to the necessary location
        data and should be verified. Since the model indicates it cannot make the
        determination without the required data, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria.

        the locations were equal/same/identical - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does provide "NO" in a box at the
        end, it explicitly states this is just a "placeholder response for the sake
        of format compliance" and that it "cannot definitively say which location
        is west of the other." The model clearly indicates it cannot make the determination,
        which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in location,
        with one being east of the other (BRAVO on 18th Avenue is east of ALPINE on
        5th Avenue). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same
        - instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions, with BRAVO
        being southwest of ALPINE. The NO answer is given because it's "southwest"
        rather than directly "west", not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold at the end of its analysis, providing a clear comparative result based

        locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions without specific location data.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO" in a box, this
        appears to be more of a placeholder example rather than an actual comparative
        conclusion. Throughout the response, the model emphasizes it cannot make the
        determination without specific location data, and explicitly states "To give
        a definitive YES or NO without the actual locations would be speculative."
        The model is effectively indicating it cannot determine the comparison.

        directional difference ("possibly slightly west") but emphasizes that the
        primary difference is north-south. Since it notes a potential directional
        difference and doesn't base its NO answer on equality of position, this doesn't
        qualify as equal values.

        or the same. Instead, it explains that Jamaica Bay is southwest of Flushing
        (not directly west), and this directional difference is the reason for the
        NO answer. Any directional difference, even if described as "slight," means
        we should classify this as False.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty about having enough information

        of the other, giving this directional difference as the reason for the NO
        answer. Even though there was some uncertainty about exact locations, the

        concluding that ALTERNATE LEARNING CENTER THOMPKINS PARK is on the east side
        while MIKVAH MID MANHATTAN is more central/potentially west. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether the first location is west of the second location. The answer
        is clearly stated and not qualified with uncertainty or inability to determine.

        east of the other (Thompkins Square Park on east side, Mid Manhattan more
        central/westward), indicating a difference in location. The NO answer appears
        to be because the premise of the question (presumably asking if one is west
        of the other) is incorrect, not because the locations are equal.

        though the exact locations are uncertain, the model asserts a directional
        difference rather than equality.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one location is east of the
        other, indicating a difference in position. The model concluded NO because
        Thompkins Park is east of Mikvah Mid Manhattan, not because they are at the
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, clearly stating that Alternate Learning Center Thompkins
        Park is not west of Mikvah Mid Manhattan. The answer was definitive and provided
        as a direct response to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicated it cannot determine the
        relative positions due to lack of information, it did not state that the locations
        are equal/identical/the same. Rather, it expressed inability to determine
        their positions but still gave a NO answer. The NO was not based on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a clear comparative result rather than refusing to answer
        or indicating inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it never
        states that the locations are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states
        it cannot determine their relative positions and lacks specific location data.
        The NO appears to be given due to inability to verify rather than due to equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it spends most of the response explaining why it cannot determine
        the locations. Since it provides a clear "NO" as its comparative result, we
        must classify this as NO, regardless of the reasoning leading up to it.

        the locations were equal or the same - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the reasoning indicates it "cannot accurately determine the directional
        relationship" and lacks "concrete information" to make the comparison. Since
        the NO is given with explicit statements that the comparison cannot be determined,
        this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

    b34eab0a-5424-4047-806a-eed0848b401b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives NO due to lack of specific geographical data
        to make the comparison. While it mentions they might be in "the same general
        area or even the same building," this is presented as a possibility rather
        than a definitive statement, and is not given as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about the comparison. Since it provides
        a clear NO rather than refusing to answer or stating it cannot determine,
        this should be classified as NO.

        the final answer as NO, the model never stated the locations were equal/same/identical
        - it stated it couldn't determine their locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation leading up to it indicates it "cannot definitively say
        which location is west of the other" and lacks "specific information about
        the locations." This makes it clear the model is saying it cannot determine
        the relationship, rather than making a comparative judgment, so this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.

        after discussing inability to verify locations and hypothetical scenarios.
        The NO is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with a clear "NO" at the end.
        While it discusses hypotheticals and acknowledges lack of data throughout,
        it ultimately provides a definitive NO answer rather than refusing to answer
        or indicating it cannot determine.

        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, but the
        explanation indicates it cannot determine the locations ("impossible to definitively
        say which is west of the other" and "determining the relative east-west positions
        of these locations is not feasible"). This is effectively stating it cannot
        make the comparison, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

        have different relative positions (Brooklyn being south of the Bronx) as the
        reason for its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it argues that Brooklyn is generally south/southeast
        of the Bronx (not west), indicating a directional difference. While expressing
        some uncertainty, it bases its NO answer on this directional relationship,
        not on equality.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it concluded NO because Brooklyn
        is southeast of the Bronx, indicating a directional difference between the
        locations. The model explicitly states that "Brooklyn is generally southeast
        of the Bronx" as its reasoning.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model does give "NO" as its final answer
        in a box notation, the entire response indicates uncertainty and inability
        to determine the relative positions due to lack of data. The model explicitly
        states "without specific geographic coordinates or a map" and "without access
        to real-time or detailed geographic data." This makes it clear that the model
        cannot actually determine the relationship, making this effectively a case
        where the model cannot verify the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    d8a4365b-7e57-4969-9ecc-b7d8aa21bf87:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal or the same - it simply stated it lacked information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO" after much
        deliberation, it explicitly indicates this is a guess due to lack of information
        and inability to determine the actual positions. The response essentially
        communicates that it cannot determine the relative positions, making this
        equivalent to "NO, I cannot verify" or "NO, I cannot determine."

      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests both locations are "generally
        in the same westward area of Manhattan," it does not explicitly state they
        are exactly equal or identical in position. The NO answer appears to be based
        on speculation and uncertainty about the exact locations rather than a determination
        that they are at the same longitude or exactly equal position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that one location
        would be east of the other (not west), indicating a directional difference.
        The NO answer is based on relative positions being different, not on them
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer in bold at the end of its analysis, making this a definitive

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it determines NO based on a directional difference,
        specifically stating that the first location would be east of the synagogue,
        not west. Since the NO answer is based on a directional difference rather
        than equality, this is False.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional comparison
        where it determines one location is east of the other, not because the locations
        are equal. It specifically states that the first location would be east of
        the Upper West Side where the synagogue is located.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (one location being east of the other), not because the locations are equal
        or the same. The model explicitly states that one location is in Central Park
        while the other is on the Upper West Side, with a clear directional relationship
        between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        are equal. Instead, it concluded NO based on its analysis that Brooklyn is
        southeast of the Bronx, indicating a different relative position. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Brooklyn is southeast
        of the Bronx") and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on the geographical
        relationship between Brooklyn and Manhattan, suggesting that Brooklyn locations
        are typically east of Manhattan locations. The model explicitly notes differences
        in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. While it acknowledges
        uncertainty about specific addresses, it provides a definitive NO based on
        general geography.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not explicitly
        state that the locations have equal/identical coordinates or positions as
        the reason. Instead, it presents hypothetical scenarios and gives a NO answer
        without specifically stating equality as the reason. The model mentions that
        NO would apply if the school is "at a higher longitude value... or the same"
        but doesn't definitively state equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        without indicating it cannot determine or verify the comparison. While it
        discusses limitations of data, it still provides a direct NO answer rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't verify one location at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, but the
        reasoning indicates it cannot verify the location of the Andrews Homeless
        Shelter and thus cannot determine the relative positions. This makes it a
        case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison, which should
        be classified as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" at the end.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions due to lack of data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, but the
        explanation leading up to it indicates it cannot determine the relative positions
        due to lack of specific location data. Since the model states it "cannot directly
        determine the relative positions" and lacks "specific geographical data",
        this is effectively stating it cannot make the comparison, which meets the
        criteria for UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer
        appears to be given due to insufficient information to make the comparison,
        not because the locations are determined to be identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty about the locations. Since it
        provides a clear NO answer (not qualified with "cannot determine" or similar),

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it gives
        a speculative NO answer without claiming the locations are identical. The
        model actually outlines different possible scenarios where the locations could
        be different (east or west of each other).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it acknowledges uncertainty about the locations. Since it provides
        a definitive NO rather than stating it cannot determine the answer, this should
        be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" as an answer, it heavily
        qualifies this by saying it's a hypothetical answer without actual data, cannot
        verify the locations, and recommends consulting a map. The model explicitly
        states it doesn't have access to the necessary information to make the determination.
        This makes it clear that the model cannot actually determine the answer, falling

      explanation_final_answer: While the model does provide "NO" at the very end,
        it explicitly states this is a "placeholder answer" and "speculative without

        difference means this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis. The answer is definitive and based on relative positioning, not
        inability to determine.

        the final answer as NO, the model never explicitly states the locations are
        exactly equal or the same - it only suggests they are "likely in close proximity"
        and "might not have a significant east-west separation".
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO" in its conclusion,
        it heavily qualifies this with phrases like "leans towards", "assuming", and
        "involves a degree of inference". The response indicates uncertainty throughout
        and explicitly states it lacks the precise location data needed for a definitive
        answer. This makes it more of an uncertain/qualified response rather than

        one location is east of the other (indicating a difference in position). The
        model states that Brooklyn is east of Manhattan and therefore the farm "cannot
        be west of" the church, showing a directional difference rather than equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and bolded
        it at the end of its response, making this a clear affirmative answer despite
        noting some uncertainty in its reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did not make any claims about equal values, but this is irrelevant since the
        first answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES/NO answer. Instead,
        it explained the process of how one would determine the answer, acknowledged
        it lacks the necessary data, and ended with "YES / NO" without choosing between
        them. This indicates it cannot make the determination.

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis, stating that THE BRONX MATHEMATICS PREPARATORY SCHOOL
        is located west of MILLENNIUM ART ACADEMY HIGH SCHOOL.

        False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is not relevant
        since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially expressed uncertainty and inability
        to provide a definitive answer without data, but then provided a "Hypothetical
        Answer" of "YES" at the end. Since this was explicitly stated as the final
        answer, even though qualified as hypothetical, we should classify this as
        YES.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly determined that one school was east of the other (with
        THE BRONX MATHEMATICS PREPARATORY SCHOOL being east of MILLENNIUM ART ACADEMY
        HIGH SCHOOL), which was the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether THE BRONX MATHEMATICS PREPARATORY SCHOOL is located west
        of MILLENNIUM ART ACADEMY HIGH SCHOOL. This was a clear comparative answer
        based on directional analysis.

        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        classification only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same as the reason for
        its NO answer. In fact, it notes that one location may be in Brooklyn rather
        than the Bronx, suggesting a difference rather than equality. The NO answer
        appears to be based on other reasoning, though not clearly specified.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about the locations. Since it provides
        a clear NO answer (not qualified with "cannot determine" or similar), and
        doesn't explicitly reject the comparison as impossible, this should be classified
        as NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        even though it notes this is a placeholder based on hypothetical reasoning.
        Since we're evaluating what the model actually stated rather than the validity
        of its reasoning, the final answer is YES.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the schools are at the same location as the primary reason. The model
        mentions "same location" only as one of several possible scenarios ("either
        because it's east, north, south, or the same location") but does not claim
        this is actually the case. The NO appears to be given due to inability to
        verify rather than due to equal locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response. While the model expresses uncertainty and
        discusses hypotheticals throughout, it does provide a clear final NO answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient information to make the
        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, but qualifies
        it heavily by saying it lacks specific location information and is speculative.
        Since the model indicates it "cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer"
        and gives a "tentative" NO based on speculation without actual data, this
        should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating "Therefore, the answer to whether Skyport Marina at 2430 FDR
        Drive, Manhattan is located west of Pier 69-E at 21st Street, Manhattan is
        NO."

      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses that both locations are
        on the waterfront/eastern edge of Manhattan, it does not explicitly state
        they are at exactly the same position or that equality is the reason for the
        NO answer. The model's reasoning appears to be based on analyzing their relative
        positions on the waterfront and grid system, without explicitly stating they
        are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        at the end of its analysis, making this a clear NO answer. While the analysis

      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses that both locations are
        on the east side of Manhattan and "essentially on the same east-west line,"
        it does not explicitly state that they are exactly equal or identical in position,
        nor does it cite equality as the primary reason for its NO answer. Instead,
        it suggests the question might be based on a misunderstanding of Manhattan's
        geography and discusses various complexities about how "west" should be interpreted
        in this context.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, making this a clear NO answer. While the model
        discusses various complexities and uncertainties, it ultimately provides a
        definitive NO rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

    b4b51f80-cd96-4919-adf6-47fbe697352e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses that both locations are
        on the east side and along the waterfront, it does not explicitly state they
        are at exactly the same longitude or that they are equal in their east-west
        positioning. Instead, it suggests that the question becomes more about north-south
        alignment and that their positions on the waterfront make the east-west comparison
        less meaningful. Since equality is not explicitly stated as the reason for
        the NO answer, this does not meet the criteria for True.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "YES / NO Answer:
        NO" at the end of its response, making this a clear NO answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both locations are "at the same
        'east-west' position" and "neither is 'west' of the other" because they are
        both on the East River at the easternmost part of Manhattan. The NO answer
        is explicitly based on this equality of their east-west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that SKYPORT MARINA is not west of PIER
        69-E 21 ST. The answer is definitive and directly addresses the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states they are on different sides of
        Manhattan (east vs west) and uses this difference in position as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.
        The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Brooklyn is east
        of Manhattan and concludes it's not possible for a Brooklyn location to be
        west of a Manhattan location due to this geographic relationship. The NO is
        based on a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Brooklyn being east of Manhattan), not on the locations being equal. The
        model explicitly states that "any point in Brooklyn is going to be east of
        any point in Manhattan," indicating a clear directional difference rather
        than equality.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that one location is east of the other, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was based on the church being east rather than west of the school.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with one location being "north and slightly east" of the other.
        The NO is based on the direction being more south than west.

        the locations are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" and explains

        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO", the explanation
        leading up to it clearly indicates it cannot determine the relative positions
        due to missing location information for one of the centers. The model explicitly
        states "we cannot accurately determine its position relative to Brooklyn College
        Child Care Services without more details." This makes it a case where the

        that Linden Houses Building 2 would be east of the assumed location of Passages
        Academy Belmont. Even though there is uncertainty about exact locations, the
        model makes a directional comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        locations, it does not base its NO answer on the locations being equal or
        the same. Instead, it reasons that if PASSAGES ACADEMY BELMONT is west of
        where LINDEN HOUSES BUILDING 2 is likely located, then LINDEN HOUSES BUILDING
        2 would not be west of it. The NO is based on a presumed difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty about exact locations throughout
        its reasoning. Since it provides a clear NO comparative answer (not saying
        it cannot determine or verify), this counts as a NO final answer.

        difference between the locations.

        the end of its response, after providing its reasoning about the geographical
        locations in Brooklyn.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it suggests that Linden Houses Building 2 would likely
        be east of Passages Academy Belmont (if the latter is in western Brooklyn),
        indicating a directional difference. The NO answer appears to be based on
        the conclusion that one location is east of the other, not that they are at
        the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

        the locations were equal/same/identical - it simply stated it lacked sufficient
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at the end, it immediately
        qualifies this as speculative and explicitly states it cannot definitively
        determine the relationship without more detailed geographic information. This
        indicates the model is actually expressing inability to determine the relationship
        rather than making a comparative conclusion, making this an UNKNOWN response.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it concluded NO because it
        believes Linden Houses Building 2 would be east of (not west of) Passages
        Academy Belmont. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" as its comparative answer,
        though it notes this is based on assumptions and hypothetical reasoning. Since
        it provides a clear directional NO answer (not saying it cannot determine
        or verify), this counts as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        that the locations are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it suggests both
        are in "eastern Brooklyn" but notes that their exact relative positions are
        uncertain. The NO appears to be based on uncertainty and potential location
        confusion rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response. While it expresses uncertainty about exact locations and
        mentions potential confusion, it still provides a clear NO answer rather than

        claims the locations are at the same longitude or otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model never stated the locations were equal/same/identical
        - it instead indicated uncertainty about one location's existence in Brooklyn.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but immediately qualifies it by noting uncertainty about locations and indicating
        it cannot make an accurate determination without precise addresses. This makes
        it clear the model cannot actually determine the comparison, making this effectively
        a statement of inability to verify rather than a comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        concluding that Brooklyn (where LOW HOUSES is located) is "south and possibly
        slightly east" of the Bronx location. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on geographical reasoning
        about relative positions, indicating that Brooklyn is likely to be east (not
        west) of the Bronx location. The model notes directional differences, not
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it actually suggested they were likely
        different (with Brooklyn being southeast of the Bronx).
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "the most likely answer is
        NO" but expresses uncertainty and caveats about precise locations. Since it
        indicates it cannot make a definitive determination without exact coordinates,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional explanation, indicating that
        Brooklyn is generally southeast of the Bronx, making it unlikely for the location
        in Brooklyn to be west of the location in the Bronx. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.

        that Dyker Beach Park Ballfield 5 is east of Stuyvesant High School, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the two locations. The NO answer was
        given because one location is east of the other, not because they are at the

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explains that one
        location is east of the other (in Brooklyn vs Manhattan), indicating a directional
        difference. The NO is based on the fact that the Brooklyn location is east,
        not west, of the Manhattan location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        Children's Center is east of PS 75, not because the locations are equal. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("appears to be
        east of PS 75"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that the Children's Center appears

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions without more information.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the bulk of the response
        explains that it cannot determine the answer without access to specific addresses
        or coordinates. The model explicitly states "the precise answer cannot be
        determined here." The NO appears to be given reluctantly just to follow instructions,
        but the actual content indicates inability to determine the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations
        and lack of data, it does not state that the locations have equal or identical
        coordinates. The NO answer appears to be given due to inability to verify
        the western position, not because the locations are determined to be at the
        same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it acknowledges lacking data. While it discusses being
        unable to make a definitive comparison, it still provides a clear NO answer
        rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO" at the very
        end, it repeatedly emphasizes that it cannot determine the relative locations
        without specific addresses. The model explicitly states "we cannot accurately
        determine" and indicates the answer "cannot be determined with certainty."
        The final NO appears to be given reluctantly only because "the format demands
        a YES or NO answer." This makes it clear that the model is actually indicating
        it cannot make the comparison, which meets our criteria for UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Rather, it gives NO because it cannot access the specific location
        data needed to verify the westward relationship. The NO is not based on the
        locations being equal/identical/the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a comparative result rather than inability to determine
        or rejection of premises. While the model expresses uncertainty about the
        actual locations, it provides a definitive NO as its final comparative answer.

        Instead, it explicitly described them as being in different locations, with
        the Children's Center in the eastern part and PS 75 in the western part of
        Brooklyn. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer
        is given due to lack of information rather than because the locations are
        at the same longitude. Therefore, this does not meet the criteria for a "True"
        classification based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about the locations. Since it provides
        a clear NO rather than refusing to answer or stating it cannot determine,
        this should be classified as NO.

        south and possibly east of the Bronx" and concludes NO because Brooklyn is
        unlikely to be west of the Bronx location. The answer is based on a directional

        or the same. Instead, it indicates that Brooklyn is "generally southeast"
        of both Manhattan and the Bronx, implying a directional difference. The NO
        answer appears to be based on this directional difference rather than equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it notes some confusion about the exact locations.
        Since it provides a clear NO answer (not saying it cannot determine or verify),
        this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines Brooklyn
        is generally southeast of the Bronx, making it unlikely for the church to
        be west of the specified location. The model notes directional differences,

        never claimed the locations were equal - it actually stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions due to lack of precise location information.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO", the reasoning
        leading up to it explicitly states "we can't definitively say one is west
        of the other" and "we lack precise enough information to give a definitive
        YES or NO." The model is essentially saying it cannot determine the relationship,

        is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite expressing uncertainty in its reasoning. While the

        the question's framing doesn't align well with Manhattan's geography and that
        being "west of" something on Manhattan's west side isn't meaningful in a geographic
        sense. The model never claims the locations are exactly equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer would lean
        towards NO" near the end of its response. While the model discusses various
        complexities and uncertainties, it does provide this clear directional answer
        rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        is west of the other, not because they are at the same location or coordinates.
        The model never claims the locations are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final comparative

        might be at "similar longitude" or "slightly north/south" of each other, indicating
        potential differences. The NO answer appears to be based on insufficient information
        to confirm one is west of the other, not because they are exactly equal in
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end

        data to make a real determination. Since it explicitly states it "cannot directly
        conclude the spatial relationship without this crucial information," this
        should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since there wasn't a NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions without data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives "NO" but immediately qualifies it
        as a "placeholder" and states it "may not accurately reflect the actual geographic
        relationship without specific location data." This indicates the model cannot
        actually determine the answer, making this effectively a statement of inability
        to verify rather than a comparative result.

        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions without addresses.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, but this NO appears to be given because it cannot determine the
        answer without exact addresses, not as a comparative result. The model repeatedly
        emphasizes it cannot make the determination without more information. This
        falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where "The model indicates it cannot make

        (and somewhat south) of the Bronx, not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly indicates there is a directional difference
        between the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because Queens is
        "east (or southeast) of the Bronx" and that "a location in Queens would typically
        be east (or southeast) of a location in the Bronx, not west." The NO is based
        on a directional difference, not equality.

        since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in its conclusion,
        though it qualifies this as a reasoned guess. Since there is an explicit YES
        statement as the comparative answer, even with caveats, this should be classified
        as YES.

        with assumptions about exact locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to
        whether MALL EIGHTEEN is west of BEACH CHANNEL PARK would be NO". While there

        the comparative question.

        about Brooklyn's geography. The NO is not based on the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expressed uncertainty about exact
        locations, it did not base its NO answer on the locations being equal or the
        same. Instead, it reasoned about relative positions and concluded NO based
        on geographical analysis of possible locations. The model never stated the
        locations were equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after its analysis, even though it expressed uncertainty in its reasoning.
        Since it provided a clear NO as its comparative conclusion, we classify this
        as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Brooklyn is east
        of Manhattan and therefore Hotel Utica (in Brooklyn) cannot be west of the
        Kirby Center (in Manhattan). The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer, stating
        that Brooklyn (where Hotel Utica would be) is east of Ward's Island/Manhattan
        (where Kirby Center is), and therefore Hotel Utica cannot be west of Kirby
        Center. Even though the model questions the existence of Hotel Utica, it still
        provides a directional comparison as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its analysis, providing a clear comparative result based on the relative
        positions of Brooklyn and Manhattan/Ward's Island.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because one location would be east of
        the other (indicating a difference in position), based on the general geographical
        layout of Brooklyn being east of Manhattan. The model notes a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, making a clear comparative judgment based on geographical layout,
        even while noting uncertainty about one location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Brooklyn being east
        of Manhattan (a directional difference), not because the locations are at
        the same position. The model explicitly states "Brooklyn is to the east of
        Manhattan" and uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The final
        answer is: NO" as its conclusion after analyzing the geographical positions.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        Brooklyn (where Hotel Utica is) is east of Manhattan (where Kirby Center is),
        indicating a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Hotel
        Utica is not west of the Kirby Center.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that Brooklyn (where
        Hotel Utica is) is east of Manhattan (where Kirby Center is), indicating a
        directional difference between the locations. The NO is given because one
        location is east of the other, not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Hotel Utica is west of the Kirby Center. The answer is clearly
        stated and provides a comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that the NO is because Brooklyn is east of Manhattan, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The model argues that since Manhattan is
        west of Brooklyn, it's impossible for a Brooklyn location to be west of a
        Manhattan location.

        False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration only applies
        when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response after its step-by-step analysis.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    e9f24387-c390-466c-8a76-abe12da60d5d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explains that the Bronx is "north or northwest of
        Brooklyn" and uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer would
        be NO" as a clear comparative result, providing geographical reasoning for
        why one location is not west of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f65d65e0-869d-4d0f-ba11-06f5e94ccb8b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since there wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: YES" at the
        end of its response, despite expressing some uncertainty in its reasoning.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
