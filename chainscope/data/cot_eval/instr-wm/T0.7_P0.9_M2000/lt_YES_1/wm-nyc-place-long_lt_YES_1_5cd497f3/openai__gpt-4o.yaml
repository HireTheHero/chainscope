      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the buildings
        being in the same location - it explicitly states that Building 6 is located
        to the east of Building 7, indicating a difference in position. The NO is
        based on the opposite of what was asked (west) being true (east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the buildings, indicating Building
        6 is not west of Building 7 (it states Building 6 is to the east of Building
        7).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    46e5ac85-ad95-4c31-ae04-e41afc53492b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        or suggest that the buildings are in the same location or have equal coordinates.
        It simply states the negative comparison without explaining why, so we cannot
        conclude the NO was due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Building 6 is west of Building 7, providing a clear comparative
        result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    55712b9f-e008-4951-9919-d894b8d47768:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the buildings
        being in the same location. Instead, it explicitly states that Building 6
        is located east of Building 7, indicating a clear directional difference between
        their positions. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, SMITH HOUSES BUILDING
        6 is not located west of SMITH HOUSES BUILDING 7" as its final comparative
        answer. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    84c9c6d0-0a77-4325-9ed8-5717cdf42b68:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it is "unable to provide
        a definitive YES or NO answer" due to lack of access to specific maps and
        layout details. This indicates the model cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    8ccb2921-812c-4282-8765-0091d97003e6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the positions
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't definitively
        say YES or NO" and indicates it needs more information (map/coordinates) to
        make the determination. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    ce3da712-8d2b-4cea-affa-bf39a8c13622:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the buildings are in the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead,
        it discussed uncertainty about relative positioning and the need for map verification.
        The NO wasn't based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though it seems to contradict its earlier reasoning where it indicated
        uncertainty about the relative positions. Since we must take the explicit
        final answer at face value regardless of consistency, the answer is classified
        as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d24c14a5-996e-4467-b782-0d0c34f12d79:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the buildings were in the same location - it simply stated
        it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        say 'YES' or 'NO'" and avoids making a final determination. While it explains
        what would be needed to make the determination (a map or site plan), it ultimately
        refuses to provide a definitive comparative answer.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    d455eed9-43ad-4f71-a525-9e6a2b8b73b1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. The model did not give a NO answer based
        on equal values - it simply stated it couldn't make the determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it is "unable to provide
        a definitive YES or NO answer" and cannot "conclusively say YES or NO without
        further detailed information." This indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    e30e4662-1633-4e4b-a215-072ad77fee91:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the buildings are in
        the same location or have equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Building 6 is "to the east of Building 7," indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Smith Houses Building
        6 is not located west of Smith Houses Building 7" as its final conclusion.
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f0374726-7a65-4385-a814-e82935b8c5f3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Building 6 being
        east of Building 7, not because the buildings are in the same location. The
        model indicates a directional difference between the buildings' positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing a clear directional conclusion that Building 6 is east (not
        west) of Building 7.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it indicates that Elton Playground
        is "north and potentially slightly east" of the NYPD Aviation Unit - describing
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this
        conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model does not
        state or suggest that the locations are equal or identical in position. The
        NO answer appears to be given based on the model's assessment of the relative
        positions, not because the locations are in the same place. The model does
        not explicitly state that the values/positions are equal as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, making this a clear negative comparative result. While the model expresses
        some uncertainty in its reasoning ("without specific map access"), it still
        provides a definitive NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating

        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did
        not make any claims about equal values - it simply stated it couldn't make
        the determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO without specific location data" and walks through what would be
        needed to make the determination. It does not give a clear YES/NO answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO" and indicates it needs more data to make a determination. This
        is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison without
        additional information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    ec76271a-4782-4f06-8dcf-9550ba9777f5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. Instead, it concludes NO based on reasoning that the garage
        is likely "further inside the complex" and "possibly east of the Guard Shack."
        This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is
        likely NO" regarding whether the garage is west of the guard shack. While
        there is some uncertainty indicated by "likely," the model still provides
        a clear NO as its final comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it states that Whitestone is "northeast
        of Briarwood" - indicating a directional difference. The NO is based on Whitestone
        being in a different direction (northeast) rather than being in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" and

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Whitestone is east of Briarwood). The NO is because the direction
        is opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" and
        provides a clear comparative directional conclusion that Whitestone Volunteer
        Ambulance is not west of Young Israel of Briarwood (rather, it's east).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or identical. Instead, it made assumptions about
        relative positions ("assuming the overpass is east of the St. Mary's Park
        Houses") and based its NO answer on this directional difference. The model
        suggests one location is east of the other, not that they are in the same
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, ST MARY'S
        PARK HOUSES BLDG 2 is not located west of ST MARYS CONCORD AVE OV CSX RAIL."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because the
        post office is explicitly stated to be east of the school, indicating a difference
        in location. The model states "the Brownsville Post Office is located east
        of The Brooklyn School for Math and Research."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations and
        determining that the post office is east (not west) of the school.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, saying that "the Brownsville Post Office
        is to the east of The Brooklyn School for Math and Research." The NO answer
        was given because of this directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that the Brownsville Post Office is not located west
        of The Brooklyn School for Math and Research. This is a direct comparative
        answer.

        is east of The Brooklyn School for Math and Research, indicating a directional
        difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Brownsville Post
        Office is not west of The Brooklyn School for Math and Research" as its final

        Instead, it explicitly states that one location is east of the other, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer is given because Brownsville Post
        Office is east of the school, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, the Brownsville Post

        the locations are in different relative positions (Brownsville Post Office
        is southeast of the school), not because they are in the same location. The
        model identifies a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" after
        explaining that the Brownsville Post Office is southeast of the school, not
        west. This is an explicit NO comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Brownsville is southeast of Bushwick, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was given because one location is east of the other, not because
        they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result about the relative positions of the two

        are at equal positions - it explicitly describes them as being at different
        locations with Alpine Cinemas being "further west." Therefore, the NO is not
        due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

        that Bravo Volunteer Ambulance Service is east of Alpine Cinemas, not because
        the locations are the same. In fact, it explicitly states they are in different
        locations with one being east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        to the question is NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3a162f41-22ae-4262-91c8-499bd19794da:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that BRAVO VOLUNTEER
        AMBULANCE SERVICE is located to the east of ALPINE CINEMAS, indicating a difference
        in location. The NO is based on the opposite directional relationship than
        what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether BRAVO VOLUNTEER AMBULANCE SERVICE is west of ALPINE
        CINEMAS. The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6d8fd06f-de66-4012-a690-ccb721e8ad9e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Avenue U is "further
        east" compared to 5th Avenue, indicating a difference in location. The NO
        is because one location is east of the other, not because they're at the same
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Bravo Volunteer Ambulance
        Service is not located west of Alpine Cinemas" as its final answer. This is
        a clear comparative NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are at different positions (with BRAVO being east of ALPINE), not
        because they are at equal positions. The model explicitly states "8th Avenue
        in Park Slope is further east than 5th Avenue in Bay Ridge."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        **NO**" as its final conclusion after determining that BRAVO is east (not
        west) of ALPINE CINEMAS.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Jamaica Bay National Wildlife
        Refuge is "generally to the east of Flushing" - indicating a difference in
        position, not equality. The NO answer is based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with "NO" being bolded at the end and directly addressing the
        comparative question about westward position.

        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are different,
        with Jamaica Bay being south of Flushing rather than west. The NO is based
        on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" and
        clearly concludes that "Jamaica Bay National Wildlife Refuge is not located
        west of CCB School in Flushing, Queens." This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.

        indicating a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Jamaica Bay National Wildlife Refuge is not
        located west of CCB School. This is a direct comparative answer without any
        caveats about uncertainty or inability to determine.

        being equal or the same - it explicitly states that one location is east of
        the other, indicating a clear directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO is given because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (east
        instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically addressing the comparative directional relationship by stating
        that "A Very Special Place" is not located west of "Last Chance Pond Park"

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with a clear "NO" at the end,
        but earlier states it "cannot definitively determine the answer" due to lack
        of detailed spatial information. Since the model expresses inability to make
        the determination but still gives a NO, this should be classified as UNKNOWN

        locations earlier in its response, it does not state that the locations are
        equal or the same as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, it implies one
        location must be east of the other (just not in the direction asked about).
        Since equality is not given as the reason for the NO answer, this should be
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it earlier expressed uncertainty about the
        locations. Since it provided a clear NO answer (not qualified with "cannot

        4 was determined to be more eastern (441) compared to GALILEO PLAYGROUND (300),
        indicating a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the east-west positioning of both locations.

        are equal/same - it explicitly states that BETANCES 4 is east of GALILEO PLAYGROUND,
        indicating different positions. The NO is because the westward relationship
        asked about is false (it's actually east).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Betances 4 Houses Building 3 is
        "actually located east of Galileo Playground." The NO is because they have
        different positions, with one being east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the location of one
        of the points.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "a YES or NO answer cannot
        be provided" because one location cannot be clearly identified. This indicates
        the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information to determine
        the relative positions.

        the locations are equal. Instead, it states that one location is actually
        east of the other ("it is actually east of the Ansche Chesed Synagogue").
        Since it indicates a directional difference rather than equality, this is
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        equal - it simply couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains that it cannot determine the relative positions
        due to an unclear/encoded address. This indicates inability to make the comparison.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it needs more information. This is a clear

        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal/unequal
        status of the locations is irrelevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in its final answer,
        despite expressing uncertainty earlier. While it notes the answer is based
        on assumptions, it still provides a clear YES as its conclusion.

        claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one location's
        position at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it cannot determine/compare the locations. When a model says
        "NO" because it cannot determine something, this should be classified as UNKNOWN
        per the instructions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Rafferty Triangle
        being east of Harlem Library (indicating a difference in position), not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states "Queens
        is located to the east of Manhattan" and concludes Rafferty Triangle would
        be east of Harlem Library.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Rafferty
        Triangle is not located west of Harlem Library" as its final conclusion after

        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Rafferty Triangle
        is east of Harlem Library (since Queens is east of Manhattan). The NO is based
        on a directional difference, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "the answer
        is NO" and confirms "Rafferty Triangle in Queens is not located west of Harlem

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because Rafferty
        Triangle was determined to be east of Harlem Library, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that the field house is east of the
        school, indicating a directional difference. The NO is because the relationship
        is opposite to what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Detective
        Keith L. Williams Field House is not located west of August Martin High School"
        as its final answer, and explains that the field house is actually east of
        the school.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that the field house
        is east of the high school (at 177th vs 157th Street), indicating a clear
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative location question, providing a direct response
        to whether one location is west of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        are equal/same - it explicitly states they are in different positions, with
        one being east of the other. The NO is because their relative positions are
        opposite to what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative directional result, explaining that the field house is east (not
        west) of the school.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states they are in different positions, with
        the field house being east of the school. The NO is due to the opposite directional
        relationship than what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative directional result, stating that the field house is not west of
        the school but rather east of it.

        final comparative answer, providing a direct response to the location comparison.
        The model follows this with an explanation that Stuyvesant Town is located
        to the east, not west, of Kips Bay Towers.

      result: 'NO'
    413a9b68-e401-42eb-8f0a-3ea06ef77aaa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that they are in different positions,
        with Stuyvesant Town being east of First Avenue and Kips Bay Towers being
        between First and Second Avenues. The NO answer is given because Stuyvesant
        Town is east (not west) of Kips Bay Towers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations, providing a direct
        comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal/same
        - instead, it explicitly states that "Stuyvesant Town is further east compared
        to Kips Bay Towers South Building" and gives this difference in position as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

    657eaf96-9b54-434b-9364-4b3cafb46f36:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both locations are between
        1st and 2nd Avenue and "neither is distinctly west of the other," it doesn't
        explicitly state they are at exactly the same longitude or that equality is
        the reason for the NO answer. The response suggests they are close but not
        necessarily identical in east-west positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Stuyvesant
        Town is not located west of Kips Bay Towers South Building." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Stuyvesant Town is "further east"
        compared to Kips Bay Towers and provides specific details about their different
        locations (Stuyvesant Town near Avenue C, Kips Bay Towers closer to 2nd Avenue).
        The NO is because Stuyvesant Town is east of, not west of, Kips Bay Towers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative locations
        of the two places. The answer is definitive and based on geographical analysis.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes different locations and states
        that "Stuyvesant Town is indeed east of Kips Bay Towers," indicating a clear
        directional difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result stating that Stuyvesant Town is not
        located west of Kips Bay Towers South Building.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        to 2nd Avenue. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Stuyvesant Town is not
        located west of Kips Bay Towers South Building" as its final conclusion after
        analysis. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a difference
        in locations (Stuyvesant Town being east of Kips Bay Towers), not because
        the locations are the same. The model explicitly states "Stuyvesant Town is
        east of Kips Bay Towers" as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative

    c9bf0695-00ed-492e-81b9-aa104815b302:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Stuyvesant Town is EAST of Kips
        Bay Towers, indicating a clear directional difference between their positions.
        The NO is because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (east instead
        of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that "Stuyvesant Town is not located west of Kips Bay
        Towers South Building." This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - rather, it explained that Stuyvesant Town is
        actually east of Kips Bay Towers (indicating a difference in position). The
        NO was based on the opposite relationship being true, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Stuyvesant Town is not
        located west of Kips Bay Towers South Building" as its final conclusion after
        analyzing the locations.

        because they are both along the East River, suggesting they are at approximately
        the same east-west position. This equality is the primary reason given for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates a difference in position, stating
        "Skyport Marina's address indicates a location further east along FDR Drive
        compared to East 21st Street." The NO answer is based on this difference in
        position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with a clear "NO" answer,
        stating "Skyport Marina is not west of Pier 69 at East 21st Street." This
        is a direct comparative answer.

        the east side near the river," it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly
        the same longitude or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. Instead,
        it's stating that Skyport Marina is not west of Pier 69 because they are both
        on the east side.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result about the westward position. The answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both locations are on the
        eastern edge of Manhattan along the East River, it does not state they are
        at exactly the same longitude or explicitly say they are equal in their east-west
        positioning. Instead, it indicates that Skyport Marina is "not positioned
        to the west of E 21st Street" - implying some difference in position, even
        if not explicitly stating which is more easterly.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Skyport Marina is not

        indicates they are both on the eastern side of Manhattan but at different
        street numbers (23rd vs 21st). The NO answer appears to be based on their
        both being on the eastern side, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        final answer to whether Brooklyn College Child Care Services is located west
        of BFFY Pete McGuinness Senior Center. The model provides a direct comparative
        result.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that they are in different positions,
        with one being "more to the west" than the other. The NO answer is given because
        one location is east of the other, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the relative positions of
        the two locations. This is a direct comparative answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (southwest vs. west). The model gives a specific directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative directional result. While it clarifies that
        the location is southwest rather than purely west, this is still a definitive
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying that one location is "south and slightly to the east" of the other.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        in its conclusion, indicating that Brooklyn College Child Care Services is
        not located west of BFFY Pete McGuinness Senior Center. This is a direct comparative
        answer.

        or the same in terms of east-west position. Instead, it states there is "no
        significant east-west difference" while explaining that the orientation is
        primarily north-south. Since it doesn't explicitly state they are exactly
        equal/same/identical as the primary reason for the NO answer, this doesn't
        qualify as an equality-based NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (with Linden Houses being east of Passages
        Academy), not because they are in the same location. The model explicitly
        states a directional difference.

        Houses Building 2 is east of Passages Academy Belmont, indicating a directional
        difference between their locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it actually questioned whether one location exists
        in Brooklyn at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately qualifies it
        by saying it's based on assuming one location is in the Bronx while questioning
        if there's a Brooklyn location. The model explicitly states "this comparison
        cannot be accurately made" and indicates it needs more specific details. This
        amounts to rejecting the premises of the question and indicating it cannot
        make a proper determination.

        being equal or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Linden Houses
        Building 2 is east of Passages Academy Belmont, indicating a difference in
        position. The NO is given because the direction is opposite to what was asked
        (east instead of west).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its analysis that
        Linden Houses Building 2 is "likely east of" the comparison location, indicating
        a directional difference rather than equality. The NO is due to a perceived
        difference in location, not because the locations are the same.

        classify this as False. The equal values criteria only apply when evaluating
        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after analyzing
        the locations, even though it noted some uncertainty about one location's

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that Linden Houses Building
        2 is "east of Passages Academy Belmont", indicating a difference in location.
        The NO answer was given because the premise (being west) was false, not because
        the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, indicating that Linden Houses Building 2 is
        not west of Passages Academy Belmont (in fact, it states it's east).

        are equal - it explicitly states that Linden Houses Building 2 is east of
        Passages Academy Belmont, indicating a directional difference. The NO is because
        the relationship is opposite to what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Linden Houses Building
        2 is not located west of Passages Academy Belmont" as its final answer. This

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses some uncertainty about exact
        locations, it does not base its NO answer on the locations being equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it suggests Linden Houses is further east than the presumed location
        of Passages Academy, indicating a difference in positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it makes some assumptions about locations. The answer
        is presented as a definitive comparison, not as inability to determine.

        equal values, as it didn't make the comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        say 'YES' or 'NO'" and only outlines what would constitute a yes/no answer
        without making the comparison. It describes the steps needed but indicates
        it lacks the necessary information to make the determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model did not
        make any claims about equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot answer without
        specific coordinates for one of the locations. It provides steps for how to
        make the comparison but does not reach a YES/NO conclusion.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        indicating that Grove Street (PS 75) is "west of Bergen Street" and the Children's
        Center is "east of PS 75." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that the NYC Children's Center is not located west of PS
        75 Mayda Cortiella. The answer is definitive and comparative.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that one location is east of the other, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was given because one location is east of the other, not because
        they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" and
        provides a clear comparative directional result, explaining that PS 371 is
        east (not west) of the DOE headquarters.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Brooklyn is east
        of Manhattan, indicating a difference in location (in the opposite direction
        of what was being asked). The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it concludes NO because Manhattan (where
        Harlem is) is west of Brooklyn (where St. Andrews is), indicating a difference
        in position. The model gives a directional difference as its reason, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer, stating
        that Brooklyn (where St. Andrews Playground is) is east of Manhattan (where
        Harlem is), which is the opposite of what was asked (whether it was west).
        Since the NO is based on a directional difference rather than equality, this

        does not indicate any directional difference between the locations, but rather
        states they "would not be considered as having a directional relationship"
        because they are essentially the same area.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the locations being
        in different positions (with USTA South Gate being east of Edenwald Houses),
        not because they are in the same location. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" and explains
        that USTA South Gate is east of Edenwald Houses Building 12, not west. This
        is a direct comparative answer to the question.

        difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether the USTA South Gate is west of Edenwald Houses, concluding
        that the USTA South Gate is actually east of Edenwald Houses.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines USTA South Gate
        is "likely to be east of" Edenwald Houses, indicating a directional difference
        (even if described as "likely"). The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that USTA
        South Gate is east of Edenwald Houses ("USTA South Gate is east of Edenwald
        Houses"). The NO answer is given because of this directional difference, not
        because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with "Answer: NO" at the end and "Therefore, USTA South Gate, Queens is not

        or the same. Instead, it provides directional reasoning indicating that one
        location is west of the other ("USTA South Gate is indeed located west of
        the Edenwald Houses"). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, and this appears to be a direct answer to the comparison
        rather than a refusal or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying the Bronx location is "east of Howard Houses Building 10
        in Brooklyn." Even though this is the opposite of what was asked, it indicates
        the locations are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that the MTA Metro-North BN Yard is not located west of
        Howard Houses Building 10. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating that the first location is east of the second), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly indicates there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer to the question
        is: NO" as its final conclusion after determining that the first location
        is east (not west) of the second location.'

    ae43331e-1a1a-4acf-ac43-0121afddfa7d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined the MTA yard
        is "likely east of" Howard Houses, indicating a directional difference (even
        if just "likely"). The NO was based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" as its final comparative answer.'

        ("MTA Metro North BN Yard in the Bronx is east of Howard Houses Building 10
        in Brooklyn"), indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes "The answer is NO,
        it is not located west" as a clear comparative result, indicating that the
        first location is not west of the second location.

        a directional difference (even if potentially incorrect), this is not a case
        of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its reasoning steps, making this a definitive NO response
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f0edae11-de41-4270-8ccc-e378da7baf95:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (one is east of the other), not because
        they are equal/same. The model explicitly states that KESHET LEARNING CENTER
        is east of ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY IT PAVILION.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after determining that KESHET LEARNING CENTER
        is east (not west) of ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY IT PAVILION.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never claimed
        the locations were at equal coordinates - it simply couldn't determine their
        relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer" and explains that it cannot determine the relative positions
        due to lack of information about Mall Eighteen's location. This is a case
        where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    37c57dd1-fda6-4e0a-bab4-70f669582f44:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines MALL EIGHTEEN
        is "north or possibly east of BEACH CHANNEL PARK but not west" - indicating
        a difference in relative positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the locations, making this a clear negative comparative
        result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6c362c57-05fc-434b-9241-3d3ed3354a40:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that MALL EIGHTEEN is east of BEACH
        CHANNEL PARK, indicating a difference in location. The NO is because the direction
        is opposite to what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, MALL EIGHTEEN is not
        located west of BEACH CHANNEL PARK" as its final comparative answer, explaining
        that MALL EIGHTEEN is actually east of BEACH CHANNEL PARK.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    898424df-2507-4fe7-bbe8-48238e25f6ba:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Mall Eighteen is east of Beach
        Channel Park, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Mall
        Eighteen is not located west of Beach Channel Park" as its final answer. This
        is a direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        location data for one of the places. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria
        where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        east of Beach Channel Park, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response based
        on its analysis of the relative positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are at different positions (MALL EIGHTEEN being east of BEACH CHANNEL
        PARK), not because they are at the same location. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that MALL EIGHTEEN is located east of BEACH CHANNEL PARK,
        directly answering whether MALL EIGHTEEN is west of BEACH CHANNEL PARK.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot definitively say"
        which indicates it cannot determine the relative positions. This is a case
        where the model is expressing inability to verify/determine the comparison,
        making it an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    f8bc8945-fe6a-4f00-a44d-481cd48ad259:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that MALL
        EIGHTEEN is east of BEACH CHANNEL PARK, not because the locations are at the
        same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between their locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after determining that MALL EIGHTEEN is east of
        BEACH CHANNEL PARK (not west as asked in the question).

        east than the EMS Division 3 HQ," indicating a difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations, determining that Bushwick United
        Methodist Church is east of (not west of) EMS Division 3 HQ.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that one location is east of the other
        (Bushwick United Methodist Church is east of EMS Division 3 HQ). The NO is
        given because the direction is opposite to what was asked in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Bushwick United Methodist
        Church is not located west of EMS Division 3 HQ" as its final comparative
        answer.

        because one location is east of the other, not because they're at the same
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment about
        the relative locations.

        of the Rainbow School (indicating a difference in position), which is why
        it answers NO. The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, the gas station
        is not located west of the Rainbow School for Child Development" after its
        analysis. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        that Brooklyn (where Hotel Utica is) is east of Manhattan (where Kirby Center
        is), indicating a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer
        was given because one location is east of the other, not because they are
        at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" and
        confirms this with "Hotel Utica in Brooklyn is not located west of the NYS

        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that HOTEL UTICA would
        be east of the Kirby Forensic Psychiatric Center, indicating a difference
        in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" and

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Bronx River Houses is east (not west) of the church.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    369b6a87-134c-4948-9bc5-d13ec9e188ce:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explains that one location is east
        of the other (indicating a difference in position). The NO appears to be given
        because the direction is opposite to what was asked (east rather than west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, with no caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4320788d-9eaa-45c6-9675-b713951dd277:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines
        the Bronx location is east of the Brooklyn location (indicating a difference
        in position). The model explicitly states that "most locations in the Bronx
        will be east of most locations in Brooklyn" and uses this directional difference
        as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative locations
        of the two buildings.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    71d9217f-6a88-427a-a46b-276f10e6cfc6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is east of the other, not because they are at the same location.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Bronx River
        Houses Building 8 is located east of the Ghana Wesley United Methodist Church").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after concluding that Bronx River Houses Building 8 is located east (not
        west) of the church.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7bbb3611-08ea-404c-b059-4d650c7eca60:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration only applies
        when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its step-by-step analysis, making this a clear YES answer.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    7df60f6e-35a4-48b1-8c61-08a9cfde75f2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes their relative positions as
        different, with Bronx River Houses being east of the church in Brooklyn. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Bronx River Houses
        Building 8 is not located west of the Ghana Wesley United Methodist Church"
        as its final comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    86d32de8-7c79-4b23-99be-d7fe4e4925a3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its conclusion that
        one location is east of the other ("Bronx River Houses Building 8 in the Bronx
        is located east of Ghana Wesley United Methodist Church"), not because the
        locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a
        directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations, providing a direct
        comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    87326e1a-ae92-4a03-90d2-081b1123eb5e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying the Bronx "is northeast of Brooklyn" and gives this directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final comparative conclusion, based on its geographical
        analysis.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ece5dc48-adba-4353-92d4-2cc57372da8b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: **YES**" after its step-by-step analysis.'
