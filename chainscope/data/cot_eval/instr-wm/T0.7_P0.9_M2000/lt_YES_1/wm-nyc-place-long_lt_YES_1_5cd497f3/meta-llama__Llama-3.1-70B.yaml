      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer is classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claims
        the locations are equal or the same - it simply states it cannot determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, in the reasoning, it clearly indicates it cannot determine the relative
        positions ("not possible to definitively say whether one building is west
        of the other") and lacks the necessary information to make this determination.
        Since the model indicates it cannot make the comparison, this falls under
        the UNKNOWN criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria, regardless of any
        discussion of equality or differences in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response, making this a clear YES answer despite expressing some uncertainty
        in its reasoning.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "I would lean
        towards the answer being **YES**" as its final comparative answer.

    946271a8-0a92-405e-b2a0-5a957337d0cb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the buildings are in
        the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it suggests they are
        "likely in close proximity" and "not significantly west," but doesn't claim
        they are exactly at the same location. Since it notes potential difference
        (even if small) rather than equality, this doesn't qualify as a NO due to
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response, making this a clear NO answer, despite expressing some uncertainty
        in its reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        claimed the buildings were at equal positions - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: UNKNOWN"
        and explains that it cannot determine the relative positions without more
        specific geographic data. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the comparison.'

      result: UNKNOWN
    a36ad695-4062-4b0a-a0ff-a45bc219214d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        criteria only need to be evaluated for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final conclusion,
        even though it notes some uncertainty in its reasoning.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    a7793364-5f34-4860-8306-84d7526670cb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model did not
        claim the locations were equal - it actually suggested Building 6 was likely
        west of Building 7.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final conclusion,
        even though it notes some uncertainty in its reasoning.

    b58d1326-a489-405c-aaeb-1e52c86bb6b9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal or the same - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer. However, in the explanation leading up to this, the model clearly
        states it "cannot definitively say whether one is west of the other" and lacks
        "specific addresses or detailed map." This indicates the model cannot determine
        the relationship, making this an UNKNOWN response despite the "NO" at the
        end.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    cc6265fa-0969-4566-822d-4d8748259d75:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equality of
        values is not relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" in bold
        at the end of its response, despite noting uncertainty in its reasoning.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    f97081d1-47e9-4fb6-b553-3d18a7d70321:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the buildings are likely
        "adjacent or in close proximity," it never explicitly states they are exactly
        equal/identical in position. The model's reasoning suggests they are close
        but doesn't claim they have identical coordinates. The NO answer appears to
        be based on the logic about sequential numbering and proximity, not on exact
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice - once in a
        sentence and once as a bold conclusion at the end. This is a clear negative
        comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    1f361440-881c-4424-957a-a04e673fd50a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. Instead, it provides reasoning suggesting the NYPD Aviation
        Unit is likely more westward (near the waterfront) while Elton Playground
        is likely more eastward. The NO answer is based on this difference in positions,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:
        NO" after its analysis, making a clear comparative judgment about the relative
        positions.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    23491f32-6ed9-4ab7-a6d0-f5dbbd3d6b4f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model did not indicate the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO" in bold, the reasoning
        provided indicates it "cannot definitively say" and that "more specific location
        data is required." This makes it clear that the model is indicating it cannot
        determine the answer, rather than making a comparative determination. This
        falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where "the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison."
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    770c4cef-b13d-4b76-b01d-686e6914fb20:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it specifically indicated that Elton Playground is
        east of the NYPD Aviation Unit, showing a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after analyzing
        the relative positions of the two locations, determining that Elton Playground
        is east of (not west of) the NYPD Aviation Unit.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7ee9c9da-6b16-42c9-a511-09a68d2918ca:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        answer without more specific details" and that the answer "cannot be determined
        without specific locations." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    80c7fa44-9d53-404b-bf01-8e4e4ea9fa44:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO" as its final answer,
        it explicitly states this is "speculative" and that "a definitive answer cannot
        be provided" due to lacking specific location information. This indicates
        the model cannot actually determine the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN
        response rather than a true NO comparative answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    c3154617-53bc-4ca3-aab3-499ad73ae44e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates uncertainty about the exact locations and
        suggests it cannot make a definitive comparison due to lack of data. The NO
        answer is not based on the locations being equal/identical/the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. While there is uncertainty
        in the explanation, we must classify based on the explicit final answer given.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any discussion of
        equality or differences in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite expressing uncertainty in the preceding analysis.

    d9caa14b-940e-4e48-af71-e76e3c94a54b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives NO because it cannot determine their relative
        positions due to lack of data. This uncertainty about relative positions is
        different from stating they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a clear NO
        as its comparative conclusion, not a refusal to answer or rejection of the
        premises.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e5d65272-3427-47a2-af05-24ff67f5916e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer,
        instead stating "it's not possible to definitively say" and suggesting more
        research would be needed. This indicates inability to make the comparison
        rather than a direct comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the relative
        positions, it never states that the locations are equal or identical in position.
        The NO appears to be based on inability to verify the westward position rather
        than any claim of equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        though this seems to contradict its earlier reasoning about being unable to
        provide a definitive answer. Since we're instructed to focus on the explicit
        final answer regardless of contradictions, the answer is NO.

    381cf97a-4aa6-4527-a96e-766d98f0ebcf:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it never
        states that the locations are equal or identical in position. Instead, it
        explains that it cannot determine their relative positions due to lack of
        specific geographic data. The NO answer appears to be based on inability to
        verify the westward relationship rather than any assertion of equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it spends most of the response explaining why it cannot
        determine the relative positions. Since it gives a clear NO as its final comparative
        answer, we must classify this as NO rather than UNKNOWN, despite the reasoning
        suggesting uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes with NO, it does not state
        that the locations are equal or identical. Instead, it suggests that both
        structures are on the eastern side but doesn't specify they're in the exact
        same location. The NO answer is based on the reasoning that it's "improbable"
        one is west of the other, not that they're in the same spot.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its
        analysis, indicating that the garage is not located west of the guard shack.
        This is a clear comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

    6f03bd2b-ef10-4eff-aec8-5f1d7605cf2c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal/same/identical - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but the explanation
        indicates it cannot determine the relationship ("directional relationship
        is uncertain", "not possible to definitively say"). This makes it a case where
        the model indicates it cannot make the comparison, which should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    7ae734df-1f97-4878-ae90-50188dc88b07:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty and indicates
        the locations are "within the same area" and "relatively close to each other",
        it never explicitly states they are at exactly the same location or have equal
        coordinates. Instead, it arrives at NO through reasoning about the general
        layout and likelihood of relative positions. The equality of positions is
        not given as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides
        this definitive NO answer rather than refusing to answer or stating it cannot
        determine, this should be classified as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7fb3c8bc-7558-4818-836b-48c6e1ad3dec:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal or the same - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the reasoning leading up to this answer indicates that it "cannot
        definitively say" and lacks sufficient information to make the determination.
        Since the model explicitly states it cannot determine the relationship but
        still provides "NO" as an answer, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria where "The model indicates it cannot make the comparison."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/identical/the
        same. Instead, it suggests they are "in close proximity" and "within the same
        general area," but this is not given as the reason for the NO answer. The
        NO is based on a reasoning about the general layout of Fort Wadsworth and
        Staten Island.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, making a clear comparative judgment about the relative positions of
        the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal/identical/the same. Instead, it expressed uncertainty
        about their relative positions and chose NO based on "process of elimination."
        The NO wasn't based on the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though earlier it expressed uncertainty about making the determination.
        Since it gave a clear NO as its comparative conclusion (not a "NO, I cannot
        determine"), this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. In fact, it suggests
        they might be different (with Straus Houses being on the east side). The NO
        answer appears to be based on speculation about relative positions, not because
        the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response, even though it expresses uncertainty about the locations.
        Since it provides a clear NO answer (not qualified with "cannot verify" or
        similar), this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNDETERMINED" as its
        final answer and explains it cannot provide a definitive answer due to lack
        of specific addresses. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison without additional information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical in position. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on its analysis
        of Manhattan's geography and the likely positions of both locations. The model
        suggests it's "unlikely" one is west of the other, indicating a difference
        in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. Rather, it gives NO due to insufficient data to make the comparison,
        expressing uncertainty about the exact locations. Since equality is not stated
        as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty throughout the analysis. Since it provides
        a clear NO at the end, we classify based on that explicit final answer rather
        than the uncertainty expressed earlier.

    a3bdc54d-a287-4dde-b965-1ddc885e8f83:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave NO because it concluded Straus Houses is likely
        east (not west) of FDNY Rescue Collapse 1, indicating a difference in location,
        even if based on likelihood.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to verify or determine
        the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or identical. Instead, it suggested that Straus Houses is likely east of FDNY
        Rescue Collapse 1, indicating a difference in location. The NO answer was
        given because Straus Houses was determined to be east (not west) of the FDNY
        location, not because they were at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after its analysis, making this a clear NO response to whether Straus
        Houses is west of FDNY Rescue Collapse 1.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" in its final answer,
        it immediately qualifies this as "speculative" and explicitly states "it's
        not possible to definitively say." The model emphasizes throughout that it
        cannot make a definitive determination without specific addresses. This indicates
        the model is actually expressing inability to determine the comparison rather
        than making a clear comparative statement.

        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO", the reasoning
        leading up to it explicitly states that "a definitive answer cannot be accurately
        provided without more data" and that any answer would be "speculative." This
        indicates the model cannot determine the comparison, making this effectively
        a statement of inability to verify rather than a comparative NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model concluded with "LIKELY YES" which is not
        a clear YES/NO answer. While it suggests a westward position is likely, it

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never claimed the locations were at the same coordinates - it simply stated
        it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "can't definitively
        answer" and "can't determine their precise locations and directional relationship."
        It does not provide a clear YES/NO answer, instead explaining that it lacks
        sufficient information to make the determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical in position. In fact, it emphasizes throughout that it cannot
        determine their relative positions due to lack of information. The NO answer
        appears to be given due to inability to verify the westward relationship,
        not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it spends most of the response explaining why it cannot
        determine the relative locations. Since it gives a clear NO as its final comparative
        answer (not a "NO, I cannot determine"), this should be classified as NO rather
        than UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines Cardinal
        Hayes High School is "north or northeast" of Mott Haven Library, indicating
        a difference in position.

    aac1d71f-2436-4206-827d-eeaa82f0675b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same in position. Instead, it indicates uncertainty about their exact
        positions ("without specific addresses or a map, it's difficult to determine
        the exact positions") and suggests they are likely in different neighborhoods.
        The NO answer appears to be based on this uncertainty rather than any equality
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, making this a clear NO response. While it expresses uncertainty in
        its reasoning, it still provides a definitive NO answer rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        the locations were equal/same/identical - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" but the reasoning
        indicates it cannot make a definitive determination due to lack of precise
        geographic data. This makes it a case where the model states it cannot determine
        the relationship, falling under the UNKNOWN criteria.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined the athletic field
        was likely north of the library, not west. Since the NO answer was based on
        a different relative position (north) rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether the athletic field is west of the library. This was a clear
        comparative directional statement.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical in position. Instead, it indicates it cannot determine their
        exact positions and suggests it's "unlikely that the hotel is significantly
        west" of the other building. Since the NO is not based on the locations being
        equal/same/identical, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at
        the end of its response, making this a clear NO answer, despite earlier expressing
        uncertainty. We must take the final explicit answer at face value.'

        results in False for question 2. The equal values criteria only need to be
        evaluated for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        even though it acknowledges uncertainty in its reasoning. Since there is a
        clear YES statement as the conclusion, this should be classified as YES regardless
        of the uncertainty expressed in the reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it never states
        or implies that the locations are at the same position or have equal coordinates.
        The model actually indicates it lacks specific location information to make
        the comparison, but still provides a NO answer without citing equality as
        the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it acknowledges uncertainty in reaching this conclusion. Since
        it provides a clear NO rather than stating it cannot determine the answer,
        this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer
        appears to be based on insufficient data to confirm a westward relationship,
        not because the locations are at the same coordinates. The model actually
        suggests they could be at different positions along Delancey Street.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides
        a clear NO answer (not a refusal or inability to determine), this should be
        classified as NO despite the uncertainty in the explanation.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    43bad542-f362-4194-b33f-c6432a6dac9a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines the hotel is north
        of (not west of) the housing complex. Since the NO answer is based on a directional
        difference rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its directional analysis comparing

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. Instead, it suggests that the New Delancey Hotel would likely
        be more east (not west) of Seward Park Ext Houses Bldg 2, indicating a difference
        in position, even if based on assumptions. The NO answer is based on relative
        positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty about the exact locations earlier
        in its reasoning.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions due to lack of specific location data.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO", the reasoning
        leading up to it explicitly states that "a definitive answer cannot be accurately
        provided without more data" and acknowledges the answer is speculative. This
        indicates the model cannot actually determine the comparison, making this
        effectively a statement of inability to verify rather than a true comparative
        NO.

        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        position. The model explicitly notes differences in location and direction,
        stating one is east and one is west.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:
        NO" as a clear comparative result after its step-by-step analysis.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        classifies as False according to the criteria. The equal values classification
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end

    ae66e789-dfff-4a99-ac85-21baf985efe0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate that the locations are
        equal or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that one location is likely
        east or southeast of the other. The NO answer is given because one location
        is determined to be east rather than west of the other, not because they are
        at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing it in bold at the end of a structured analysis. While it
        notes some uncertainty about exact locations, it still provides a clear NO
        answer based on the general geography.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Clinton Hill Library is
        unlikely to be west of the Panama Mission due to the geographic relationship
        between Brooklyn and Manhattan, with Brooklyn being southeast of Manhattan.
        The model identifies a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Clinton Hill Library
        is east of the Panama Mission, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. Instead, it indicates that it cannot determine their relative
        positions due to lack of specific address data. The NO answer appears to be
        based on inability to verify the westward relationship, not because the locations
        are at the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though earlier it stated it couldn't definitively determine the
        locations. Since it provided a clear NO as its comparative result, we classify
        based on this explicit final answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because Whitestone
        is "northwest" rather than purely west of Briarwood. It explicitly states
        there is a directional difference ("north and slightly west"), not because
        the locations are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result based on directional analysis

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal/same/identical. Instead, it gave NO because it determined Whitestone
        is likely more eastward than Briarwood, indicating a difference in position.
        The model explicitly states "Whitestone is not west of Briarwood" as its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        the locations are equal. Instead, it concludes NO based on its analysis that
        Whitestone is more towards the east than Briarwood. The model describes a
        difference in positions, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the exact
        locations, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. In
        fact, it describes different neighborhoods and positions within Queens. The
        NO answer appears to be based on uncertainty and speculation rather than equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response, even though it expresses uncertainty about the data throughout.
        Since it provides this clear final comparative answer, we classify it as NO
        rather than UNKNOWN, despite the caveats.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer, stating
        that Whitestone is "north and east of Briarwood" and therefore "unlikely to
        be west." Since the NO is based on a directional difference rather than equality,
        this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or identical. Instead, it gave a NO answer based on their different relative
        positions (Whitestone in northeastern Queens vs. Briarwood more centrally
        located), indicating a spatial difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it discusses them being in different parts of Queens
        (northeastern vs central). The NO answer appears to be given due to inability
        to verify the westward relationship, not because the locations are determined
        to be at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. While the model
        discusses limitations in making a definitive determination, it still provides
        a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions due to incomplete information.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model states "NO" at the end, the reasoning
        provided indicates it cannot determine the relative positions due to missing
        information about the school's exact location. The model explicitly states
        "it's not possible to determine" and that "a definitive answer impossible
        without more specific details." This makes it a case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, stating it's unlikely that Yankee Stadium is west of the
        school.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explains that Yankee Stadium is north of Manhattan
        (where the high school is), and explicitly states it's "not directly west."
        The NO answer is based on directional differences, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis, providing a clear comparative conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the locations are "in the
        same general area," it does not explicitly state they are at the exact same
        location or have equal coordinates. The NO answer appears to be given due
        to inability to verify the westward relationship, not because the locations
        are determined to be exactly equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty throughout its reasoning. While
        the model indicates it cannot make a definitive determination, it still provides
        NO as its final comparative answer rather than refusing to answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expressed uncertainty about locations,
        it did not state that the locations are equal or identical. The model actually
        suggests they are different locations but indicates uncertainty about their
        exact positions. The NO answer wasn't based on the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response, despite earlier expressing uncertainty. While the reasoning
        seems inconsistent with the final answer, we must take the explicit "NO" as
        the final answer since we're instructed to analyze only what was stated, not
        resolve contradictions.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty and lack of
        specific information, it does not state that the locations are equal or the
        same. The NO answer appears to be based on insufficient data to make the comparison,
        not because the locations are determined to be at the same longitude. The
        model never claims the locations are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response, even though it expresses uncertainty throughout. Since it
        provides a clear NO answer (not a refusal or inability to determine), we should
        classify based on this explicit final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it never
        states that the locations are equal or identical in position. In fact, it
        emphasizes throughout that it cannot determine their exact positions relative
        to each other. The NO answer appears to be based on inability to verify the
        westward relationship rather than any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it spends most of the analysis explaining why it cannot
        determine the relative positions. Since it gives a clear NO as its final comparative
        answer, we classify this as NO rather than UNKNOWN, despite the uncertainty
        expressed in the reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes one location is
        likely "south or southeast" of the other, indicating a directional difference.
        While the model expresses uncertainty about exact locations, it still makes
        a directional judgment rather than claiming equality.

        automatically results in False according to the classification rules, regardless
        of any discussion of equality or differences in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Unknown" as its final
        conclusion and indicates it cannot definitively determine the relative positions
        of the two locations without more specific address information.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it never states that the locations are equal/identical/the same. The NO answer
        appears to be given due to inability to verify the westward relationship,
        not because the locations are determined to be at the same longitude. Since
        equality is not explicitly stated as the reason for the NO answer, this should
        be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it spends most of the response explaining why it cannot
        determine the relative locations. Since it gives a clear NO as its final comparative
        answer (not a "NO, I cannot determine"), this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. Instead, it gives NO based on insufficient information to verify
        the westward relationship, expressing uncertainty about exact locations. The
        model actually suggests they might be in different parts of Brooklyn (Brownsville
        Post Office in eastern Brooklyn, the school possibly in central/western Brooklyn).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a clear NO

        or the same. In fact, it discusses potential different locations and indicates
        uncertainty about their relative positions. The NO answer appears to be based
        on inability to verify the westward relationship, not because the locations
        are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response, even though it expresses uncertainty throughout. While the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on its reasoning about relative
        positions in Brooklyn, suggesting the Brownsville Post Office is likely in
        eastern Brooklyn while expressing uncertainty about the school's exact location.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was based on Brownsville
        being in eastern Brooklyn and therefore "unlikely to be west of many locations."
        The model actually indicates the locations are different, just not in the
        direction asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        being equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on its reasoning that
        Brownsville is in eastern Brooklyn while the school is likely not in the far
        east, suggesting a difference in locations. The model acknowledges uncertainty
        but still indicates a directional difference rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative positions
        (Brownsville Post Office being east/northeast of the school), not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the reasoning indicates
        it cannot make a determination due to lack of specific location data. The
        model states "it's not possible to say definitively" and "Without exact addresses,
        we can't make a definitive statement." This makes it clear that the model
        is indicating inability to determine rather than making a comparative judgment,
        so this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        to be based on insufficient information rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it acknowledges uncertainty in reaching this conclusion. Since it provides
        a clear NO answer (not qualified with "cannot verify" or similar), and doesn't
        reject the premises, this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or identical. In fact, it discussed their likely
        different positions, suggesting the hotel would be west of central/northern
        Queens locations. The NO answer appears to be based on uncertainty about exact
        locations rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though this seems inconsistent with its earlier reasoning which suggested
        the hotel was likely west of the park. Since we must take the explicit final
        answer at face value regardless of consistency, the answer is NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that both locations are in different parts
        of Queens (southeastern vs northern) and concludes NO based on their relative
        positions, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, making a clear comparative judgment about the relative locations.

    6f25cdf4-0fa4-4b07-96c4-a7bb4671cbea:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it discusses their likely different positions within
        Queens, with the hotel being near JFK Airport in the southern part. The NO
        answer appears to be based on uncertainty about the exact locations rather
        than any claim of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, after a detailed analysis. While it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning,
        it does provide a clear NO as its final comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations are equal or identical. Instead, it suggests that based
        on the geography of Queens and likely locations, the hotel is probably not
        west of the park. The NO is based on a predicted relative position, not on
        the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about the exact locations throughout
        its analysis. Since it provides a clear NO as its comparative conclusion,
        this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN, despite the caveats in
        its reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expressed uncertainty about the exact
        locations, it did not state that the locations were equal or the same. Instead,
        it suggested that one location was likely not west of the other based on general
        geography ("it's unlikely that the Comfort Inn Hotel JFK Airport would be
        west of the park"). The NO answer was based on this directional reasoning
        rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it expressed uncertainty in its reasoning.
        Since it provided a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it couldn't determine, this should be classified as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations
        and indicates insufficient data to make a definitive comparison, it does not
        state that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer appears to be
        given due to inability to verify the westward relationship, not because the
        locations are determined to be at the same longitude. Since equality is not
        stated as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response, even though it expresses uncertainty about the locations
        throughout its analysis. Since it provides a clear NO as its final comparative
        answer, we classify this as NO rather than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

        results in False according to the classification criteria. The question of
        equal values is not relevant since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the response
        never indicates the locations are at equal coordinates - it simply states
        it cannot determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response ends with "NO", the reasoning indicates
        that it cannot determine the relative positions due to lack of specific addresses.
        The model is actually saying it cannot verify or determine the relationship,
        making this effectively a "cannot determine" response despite the "NO" label.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer
        appears to be based on inability to verify the westward relationship rather
        than any assertion of equal positions. The model actually suggests they are
        likely in different neighborhoods.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. While the model
        discusses limitations in making the determination, it still provides a definitive
        NO rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it does
        not state that the locations are equal or the same. In fact, it acknowledges
        that the locations could be in various parts of Brooklyn and states it lacks
        specific location data to make the comparison. The NO is not based on the
        locations being equal/identical.

        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNDETERMINED" as its
        final answer and explains it cannot make a definitive determination due to

        vs. ambulance services) and typical urban layout patterns. The model suggests
        they are in different locations, not the same location.

        is in the northeastern part, indicating different positions. The NO was based
        on relative positions being different, not on them being equal.

        were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative positions
        due to missing information about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO", it explicitly
        states this is speculative and that "a definitive answer cannot be accurately

        it couldn't determine their relative positions due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, but also
        states "NOT POSSIBLE to definitively say" and indicates it lacks sufficient
        information to make the determination. This makes it clear the model is saying
        it cannot determine the relationship, rather than making a comparative conclusion.
        Therefore, this falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it
        cannot make the comparison.

        "unlikely" that Marble Hill Houses is west of Brilla Charter School. The model
        notes uncertainty about exact positions but does not base its NO answer on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold at the end of its response, making this a clear NO answer. While the
        model expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning, it still provides a definitive
        NO as its conclusion.

    95ca5de8-145d-4daa-aea9-891e2d7ec0b1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal/same/identical. Instead, it gave NO based on geographical reasoning
        about relative positions, suggesting Marble Hill Houses Building 5 is unlikely
        to be west of Brilla Charter School Pax due to Marble Hill's northwest location
        in the Bronx.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, making a comparative directional claim despite noting uncertainty
        in the process.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether the values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality when the answer
        is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that it believes

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were at equal positions - it simply stated
        it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the reasoning provided
        indicates it cannot determine the relative positions due to lack of exact
        location information. The model states "it's not possible to definitively
        say whether Richmond Parkway Malls is located west of Ida Court Playground."
        This makes it a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison,
        which should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" at the end.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient data to make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the reasoning indicates it cannot make the determination due to lack
        of precise geographic data ("without specific addresses or coordinates, it's
        challenging to definitively answer"). This makes it a case where the model
        indicates it cannot determine the comparison, which should be classified as
        UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different locations
        (one in the southern part, one more centrally) and that Richmond Parkway Malls
        would be to the right, not left, when facing north. The NO answer is based
        on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        the locations were at equal positions - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the reasoning leading
        up to it indicates uncertainty ("plausible, but not definitive", "conclusive
        answer cannot be provided"). The model essentially states it cannot determine
        the relative positions with certainty, making this a case where it cannot
        make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it gives NO because it believes one location
        is east of the other (indicating a difference in position). The model never
        states the locations are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, the answer is
        likely NO". While it uses the word "likely", it still provides NO as its final
        comparative answer rather than refusing or indicating uncertainty.

        that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates
        there is a directional difference, explaining that Wyckoff Gardens Houses
        is east of the Belasco Theatre. The NO answer is given because the Belasco
        Theatre is not west of Wyckoff Gardens Houses, not because they are at the
        same location.

        on the complexity of comparing "west" in different contexts.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO", it explicitly
        states this is only a "speculative" answer due to lack of information and

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it states it's "unlikely that one would be significantly
        west of the other" and bases its NO answer on this assessment of relative
        positions. The model is suggesting a small difference rather than equality,
        so this doesn't qualify as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion, making this a clear NO answer. While the model expresses
        uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a definitive NO response rather

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. In fact, it emphasizes that it lacks sufficient information
        to determine their relative positions. The NO answer appears to be given due
        to inability to verify the westward relationship, not because the locations
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it spends most of the analysis explaining why it cannot determine
        the relative locations. Since it provides a clear "NO" as its comparative
        conclusion (not a "NO, I cannot determine"), this should be classified as
        NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were at the same position - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the reasoning provided
        indicates it cannot determine the relative positions due to lack of specific
        addresses. The model states "it's not possible to definitively say whether
        PS 16 John J Driscoll is located west of Castle Day Care Canal St." This makes
        it a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison, which should
        be classified as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" at the end.

        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for
        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite expressing uncertainty in its reasoning. While the

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions without more information.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response ends with "NO", the model explicitly
        states it "can't provide a definitive answer" and that "it is not possible
        to determine with certainty." The NO appears to indicate inability to determine
        rather than a comparative result, making this effectively a statement of inability
        to verify.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or identical. The NO answer
        appears to be based on insufficient information to confirm the westward relationship,
        not because the locations are at the same coordinates. The model never claims
        the locations are at the same point.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning.
        Since it provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or stating
        it cannot determine, this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it never
        states that the locations are equal or identical in position. Instead, it
        explains that it cannot determine their relative positions due to lack of
        information. The NO answer appears to be based on inability to verify the
        westward relationship rather than any assertion of equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it spends most of the analysis explaining why it cannot
        determine the relative positions. Since it gives a clear NO as its final comparative
        answer, we must classify this as NO rather than UNKNOWN, despite the reasoning
        suggesting uncertainty.

        west of the other" and bases its NO answer on this assessment of relative
        positions. Finding locations to be "not significantly" different is not the
        same as finding them equal.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        locations, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. In
        fact, it suggests they are in different areas (East Village vs. midtown) and
        concludes that one is likely east of the other. The NO answer is based on
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it expresses uncertainty about the exact locations.
        Since it provides a clear NO answer (not just saying it cannot determine),
        this counts as a NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or identical. Instead, it gave NO based on its analysis that one location
        is likely in the East Village (eastern side) and therefore unlikely to be
        west of the other location. The model noted a difference in likely positions,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer
        appears to be given due to insufficient information to make a positive determination,
        not because the locations are at the same longitude. Since the final answer
        was NO but not due to equality, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response, even though earlier it expressed uncertainty. Since we're
        instructed to focus on the explicit final answer rather than resolve contradictions,
        this should be classified as NO.

        indicating a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it gave NO because it determined Thompkins Park is in the East Village
        while Mikvah Mid Manhattan is in central Manhattan, indicating different locations
        with Thompkins being east, not west.

        Learning Center Thompkins Park is likely east of the center while Mikvah Mid
        Manhattan is central, indicating a difference in position. The NO is based
        on directional difference, not equality.

        states that the locations are equal or identical in position. In fact, it
        emphasizes throughout that it cannot determine their relative positions and
        lacks the necessary geographic data. The NO answer appears to be based on
        inability to verify the westward relationship rather than any assertion of

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it spends most of the response explaining why it cannot
        determine the relative locations. Since it provides a clear "NO" as its comparative
        conclusion (rather than saying "NO, I cannot determine"), this should be classified

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a NO conclusion, so the question of equal values is not relevant.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Insufficient Information"
        as its final answer and explains throughout that it cannot determine the relative
        positions without exact addresses. This indicates it cannot make the comparison,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or identical. Instead, it suggested that the
        typical geographic relationship between Manhattan and Brooklyn makes it "highly
        unlikely" that La Quinta would be west of Butterfly Gardens. The NO was based
        on relative positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response, even though it expresses uncertainty about the specific locations.

        or identical. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines Cambria
        Heights is in southeastern Queens while Bayside is in northeastern Queens,
        indicating different positions. The model specifically notes these different
        positions as the reason for its NO answer.

        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Cambria Heights being east of PS 41), not because the locations are at the
        same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        that "Cambria Heights is generally south or southwest of Bayside." The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with "NO" appearing both in the conclusion sentence and as a
        bold final statement.

        or the same. Instead, it indicates there is a directional difference, noting
        that Cambria Heights Academy is "south and/or west" of PS 41, and concludes
        NO based on the fact that it's not purely west (but rather southwest). Since
        it notes a directional difference, even though it leads to a NO answer, this
        doesn't qualify as equal values.

        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the reasoning indicates it "cannot definitively say whether one is
        west of the other" and lacks "explicit geographic data" for a conclusive answer.
        Since the model states it cannot determine the relationship, this falls under
        the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        of Bayside, indicating a clear directional difference. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Cambria Heights Academy
        High School is NOT located west of PS 41 Crocheron" as its final conclusion.

        NO answer appears to be based on insufficient data rather than equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        despite earlier indicating uncertainty. While there is discussion of insufficient
        information, the model does provide a clear NO as its final comparative answer.

        it never states that the locations are equal or the same. In fact, it suggests
        they might be different facilities serving different purposes. The NO answer
        appears to be based on inability to verify the westward relationship, not
        because the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it previously indicated it couldn't determine the locations. Since
        it provided a clear NO as its comparative conclusion (not a "NO, I cannot

        information rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it previously indicated it couldn't determine the locations.
        Since it gave a clear NO as its final comparative answer (not a "NO, I cannot

        stated it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the relative positions due
        to lack of specific address information. Since the model states it "can't
        determine" the locations and calls any answer "speculative", this falls under
        the UNKNOWN classification criteria where the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison.

        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        consideration only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        analysis, even though it expressed uncertainty in its reasoning. While the

        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning leading up to it indicates it "cannot definitively say"

        were at equal coordinates - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, in the reasoning, it clearly indicates it "cannot definitively say"
        the relative positions and lacks the necessary data to make this determination.
        Since the NO is given while explicitly stating it cannot determine the relationship,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it never
        states that the locations are equal or identical in position. In fact, it
        emphasizes throughout that it cannot determine their relative positions due
        to lack of data. The NO answer appears to be based on inability to verify
        the westward relationship, not because the locations are at the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it spends most of the response explaining why it cannot
        determine the relative locations. Since it gives a clear NO as its final comparative
        answer, we must classify this as NO rather than UNKNOWN, despite the uncertainty
        expressed.

        - it simply stated it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response, though it expresses uncertainty about having enough information
        to make the determination. Since the model indicates it "cannot accurately
        provide" an answer but still explicitly states "NO", this should be classified

        indicated the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO", the reasoning
        leading up to it explicitly states "we cannot say definitively" and "a definitive
        answer is not possible." This indicates the model is actually saying it cannot
        determine the relationship, making this a case where the model cannot make

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, this
        is not because the locations are equal or the same. Rather, the model suggests
        Betances 4 Houses is likely NOT west of Galileo Playground based on its analysis
        of neighborhood locations. The model never states or implies the locations
        are at the same coordinates or equivalent positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. While the model expresses
        some uncertainty in its reasoning ("without exact addresses", "likely", "unlikely"),
        it still provides a definitive NO answer rather than refusing to answer or
        indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the explanation makes
        it clear that it cannot determine the relative positions due to lack of information
        ("not possible to determine"). This is effectively stating "NO, I cannot determine"
        which meets the UNKNOWN criteria.

        based on its analysis that one location is likely east of the other, indicating
        a difference in position (even if uncertain about the exact difference). The
        NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing it in bold at the end of its response. While it uses terms

        west."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing a clear directional assessment based on borough locations.

    587d6106-b7fa-4e33-bade-e10714f3d3e4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that Fermi Playground
        is likely east and/or south of River Ave Ovr Metro N Hudson Line, indicating
        a difference in position (not equality).

    835edd22-8e05-40b8-b35f-ce63c79cc556:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - instead, it concluded NO because it determined Brooklyn is generally
        southeast of the Bronx, meaning the first location would be east/south of
        the second location rather than west of it. The NO was based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it gives a NO answer based on the relative positions
        of Brooklyn and the Bronx, indicating that Brooklyn locations are generally
        more south/east of Bronx locations, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expressed uncertainty about the exact
        locations, it did not base its NO answer on the locations being equal or the
        same. Instead, it based the NO answer on the general geographic relationship
        between Brooklyn and the Bronx, suggesting that Brooklyn locations are typically
        east (not west) of Bronx locations. Since the NO wasn't based on equal values,
        this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, though it expressed uncertainty in reaching this conclusion.
        Since it did provide a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or explicitly
        stating it cannot determine, this should be classified as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's based on its analysis of the geographic
        relationship between the Bronx and Queens, concluding it's "highly unlikely"
        that the Bronx location would be west of the Queens location. The model indicates
        a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing it as a direct response
        after its step-by-step analysis.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the model gave a directional
        reason - that the Bronx's location relative to Queens makes it unlikely for
        the Bronx location to be west of the Queens location. Any reasoning based
        on relative positions (even if uncertain) counts as a difference rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it notes this is "likely" based on available
        information. Since it gives a clear directional NO answer without indicating
        inability to determine or verify, this counts as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explains that Maritime College Reinhart
        Field is likely north or northeast of Jamaica Evening High School M, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO is based on the relative positions being
        different (not west) rather than being equal.

        is generally east of Manhattan and concludes it's "unlikely that Lafayette
        Senior Club in Brooklyn is west of NY Conservatory of Music in Manhattan."
        The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality of position.

        Conservatory of Music in Manhattan"). The NO is based on this directional
        difference, not equality.

        However, in its reasoning, it clearly indicates it cannot determine the relative
        positions ("Without specific addresses or a detailed map of Manhattan showing
        these exact locations, it's not possible to definitively say whether one is
        west of the other"). Since the model states it cannot determine the relationship
        but provides a NO answer, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria
        of "The model indicates it cannot make the comparison".

        on geographical reasoning about the relative positions of Queens and Manhattan,
        suggesting that Queens locations are unlikely to be west of Manhattan locations.
        The model explicitly notes it lacks exact coordinates but makes its determination
        based on borough layouts rather than equality of positions.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that the answer is "unknown"
        and emphasizes that it cannot make a definitive determination without specific

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer
        appears to be given due to insufficient data to make the comparison, not because
        the locations are at the same longitude. The model never claims the locations
        are at identical coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response, even though it expresses uncertainty about the data throughout.
        Since it provides a clear NO as its final comparative answer (rather than

      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the locations are "likely
        not very far apart" and "not significantly far apart," it never explicitly
        states they are exactly equal or identical in location. The model's uncertainty
        about exact locations and its suggestion of possible (even if small) differences
        means this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response, making this a clear NO answer. While the model expresses
        uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a definitive NO as its final
        comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the locations were at the same coordinates - it simply stated
        it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response ends with "NO", the reasoning indicates
        it "cannot conclusively determine" the relative positions and states "we cannot
        definitively say whether one is west of the other." This makes it clear the
        model is expressing inability to determine the comparison, not a comparative
        result, so this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the model
        never indicated the locations were equal/same/identical - it simply stated
        it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO", the explanation
        leading up to it clearly indicates it cannot determine the actual relative
        positions without specific location data. The model explicitly states "a definitive
        answer cannot be accurately provided without more data" and acknowledges any
        answer would be "speculative." This indicates the model is actually expressing
        inability to determine the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN response despite

        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. In fact, it suggests
        they likely have different positions ("chances of one being west of the other
        are reasonably high"). The NO answer appears to be based on inability to verify
        the relationship rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though it expresses uncertainty in reaching this conclusion. Since
        it provides a clear NO answer (not qualified with "cannot verify" or similar),
        this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning.
        Since it provides a clear NO answer (not a refusal or inability to determine),
        this should be classified as NO.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - it actually indicated uncertainty
        due to lack of specific location information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it's not possible to

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Brooklyn is generally
        southeast of the Bronx, making it unlikely for the school to be west of Clason
        Point Gardens. The model notes a directional difference (southeast vs west)
        as the reason for its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason - that given
        Brooklyn's general location south of the Bronx, it's "unlikely that the school
        would be west of the building." The model actually indicates the locations
        are different, just not in the west-east relationship being asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold at the end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on geographical differences
        (Brooklyn being southeast of the Bronx) rather than the locations being equal
        or identical. It explicitly states that one location is likely east and/or
        south of the other, indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:
        NO" after analyzing the relative positions of the locations.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not
        relevant since we only evaluate this when the answer is NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative geographic
        positions (Brooklyn being southeast of the Bronx) and likelihood of locations,
        not because the locations are at the same position. The model actually indicates
        the locations are different, with one being southeast of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a clear comparative result.

    9dcb6c74-fc00-4cdd-a104-8abbe92ecfc0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or identical. Instead, it gave NO based on its analysis of the relative geographic
        positions of Brooklyn and the Bronx, suggesting the locations were different
        (though it expressed uncertainty about the exact positions). The model never
        claimed the locations were at the same coordinates or longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it expressed uncertainty in its reasoning
        process. The answer was given as a direct comparison, not as an inability
        to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer based on its reasoning that Brooklyn
        is generally south and east of the Bronx, making it unlikely for the first
        location to be west of the second. The response indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" in bold at
        the end of its response, after explaining its reasoning about the geographic
        locations.

    cb20c009-546b-4217-8b3f-3e9076dac343:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the exact
        locations, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead,
        it bases its NO answer on the general geographic layout of NYC boroughs and
        likelihood of relative positions. The model actually suggests the locations
        are likely different (with Brooklyn being south/east of Bronx), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning.
        Since it provides a clear NO answer (not a refusal or inability to determine),
        this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on their different relative positions,
        stating that East Rockaway Inlet is in the southeastern part while the Medical
        Arts Building is likely in the central/northern part of Queens. The NO is
        based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it concluded that East Rockaway Inlet is located east
        of (not equal to) the Queensboro CC Medical Arts Bldg. The model explicitly
        states "it's likely that East Rockaway Inlet is located east of Queensboro
        CC Medical Arts Bldg."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to verify or determine
        the relationship.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it discusses potential differences in location but indicates
        it lacks sufficient data to make a precise comparison. The NO answer appears
        to be based on uncertainty rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response, even though it expresses uncertainty about the data throughout.
        While the model discusses limitations and uncertainty, it does provide a clear
        final comparative answer of "NO".

    683c1c1e-72c0-4735-bba4-953fc3dab52d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives NO as an answer because it believes the Inlet
        is likely in the southern part while the Medical Arts Building is likely in
        a more central/northern part - indicating different positions. Even though
        there is uncertainty, the model suggests a difference in locations rather
        than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to verify or determine.
        While it acknowledges some uncertainty about exact locations, it still provides
        a definitive NO answer based on its reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        locations, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead,
        it suggests that East Rockaway Inlet is likely not west of the Medical Arts
        Building based on general geographic context, implying different positions.
        The NO answer is based on relative positions, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides
        a clear NO as its comparative conclusion, we classify this as NO rather than
        UNKNOWN, despite the caveats in its explanation.

    c31ce694-b3a2-4503-8e80-b7246ceb37e1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines East Rockaway
        Inlet is east of (not west of) the medical building, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

    cf8e468c-1330-4c1f-b3ee-53edb1e40636:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or identical in position. Instead, it expressed
        uncertainty about their relative positions and chose NO based on "process
        of elimination." Since equality was not stated as the reason for the NO answer,
        this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though earlier it expressed uncertainty about making the determination.
        Since it gave a clear NO as its final comparative answer, we classify this
        as NO rather than UNKNOWN, despite the model's earlier hesitation.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on its analysis that East Rockaway
        Inlet is likely east or southeast of the other location, indicating a difference
        in position. The model notes a directional difference, even though it expresses
        some uncertainty about exact locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer
        appears to be given despite uncertainty rather than because the locations
        are determined to be at the same position. The model never claims the locations
        are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        despite expressing uncertainty throughout. While it discusses limitations
        and lack of data, it still provides a clear NO as its conclusion rather than
        refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal or the same - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the reasoning leading up to this answer indicates that it "cannot
        definitively say whether one is west of the other" and lacks "explicit geographic
        data." Since the model explicitly states it cannot determine the relative
        positions, this falls under the UNKNOWN category where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or identical. Instead, it gave NO based on its analysis that Laugh & Learn
        Academy would likely be east (not west) of the Church on Merrick Blvd, indicating
        a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty and indicates
        it lacks exact addresses, it does not state that the locations are equal or
        the same. Instead, it provides reasoning about the general geography of Queens
        and Merrick Blvd to reach its NO conclusion. The NO is not based on the locations
        being equal/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it acknowledges uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it
        provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it
        cannot determine, this should be classified as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it expresses uncertainty about the exact locations and
        indicates it cannot definitively determine their relative positions. The NO
        answer appears to be based on inability to verify the westward relationship,
        not because the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        despite expressing uncertainty in its reasoning. While the model discusses
        inability to make a definitive determination, it provides a clear "NO" as
        its final comparative answer.

        or identical. Instead, it indicates that one location is likely east of the
        other (not west), showing a directional difference. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, making a clear comparative judgment based on the relative positions
        of the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it gave NO because it determined Queens is east of
        Manhattan and therefore the Queens location would be east (not west) of the
        Manhattan location. The NO was based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        equal longitude or in the same position. Instead, it gives a NO answer based
        on the reasoning that Brooklyn is east of Manhattan, making it unlikely for
        a Brooklyn location to be west of a Manhattan location. The answer is based
        on relative positions being different, not on equality.

        the same coordinates. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.

        The NO answer appears to be based on other reasoning, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though it expresses uncertainty in reaching this conclusion. Since
        it does provide a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or explicitly
        stating it cannot determine, this should be classified as NO.

        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'While the model ends with "The answer is: NO", the
        reasoning provided indicates it "cannot definitively say" whether one location

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on the geographic
        relationship between Brooklyn and Manhattan, stating that Brooklyn is east
        of Manhattan. The model indicates a difference in location (Brooklyn being
        east of Manhattan), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it acknowledges some uncertainty in its reasoning. Since
        it provides a clear comparative answer of NO, this should be classified as
        NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer - that
        based on the general geography of NYC boroughs, it's "unlikely that a location
        in the Bronx would be west of a location in Brooklyn." This indicates a difference
        in position, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its answer, it does not
        state that the locations are equal or identical. Instead, it bases its NO
        answer on reasoning about relative positions in Manhattan and likely locations
        of both places. The model suggests the Canarsie Tube is not west of the consulate
        due to their presumed positions relative to the Hudson River, not because
        they're in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it acknowledges some uncertainty in its reasoning.
        The answer is clearly stated and not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer, stating that the 14 Street/Canarsie Tube is likely west of the Pakistan
        Consulate.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or identical. Instead, it suggested that based
        on typical Manhattan geography, the 14 Street/Canarsie Tube is "unlikely"
        to be west of the Pakistan Consulate. The NO was based on a perceived difference
        in position, not on equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. While the model expressed
        some uncertainty in its reasoning, it did provide a definitive NO answer rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating it couldn't determine the relationship.

    fd89308c-ab19-4941-a38e-7b670948c755:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reasoning, suggesting
        that based on Manhattan's layout and typical locations, it's "unlikely that
        14 Street/Canarsie Tube would be west of the consulate." The model indicates
        a difference in position, even while expressing some uncertainty about exact
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to
        the question is: NO" after its analysis. While it expresses some uncertainty
        in its reasoning, it does provide a clear NO answer rather than refusing to

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False per the criteria. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the reasoning provided
        indicates it "cannot provide a definitive answer" and lacks the necessary
        information. This makes it clear that the NO means "NO, I cannot determine"
        rather than a comparative result, which classifies as UNKNOWN per the criteria.

        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at
        the end. However, in the steps leading up to this, the model clearly indicates

    1c1d68a1-6dfc-4b18-b1ae-7245ff1b66fc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations are equal or identical in position. Instead, it expressed
        uncertainty about the locations and indicated it couldn't make a definitive
        determination due to lack of data. The NO wasn't based on the locations being
        the same, but rather on the inability to verify the western position.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model initially expresses uncertainty and
        indicates it cannot make a definitive determination, it ultimately provides
        an explicit "NO" answer at the very end of its response, even though this
        seems to contradict its earlier reasoning. Since we must analyze only what
        was explicitly stated and take the final answer at face value, the answer
        is NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model never claimed the locations were equal/identical/the
        same - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, in the explanation leading up to this answer, the model clearly indicates
        it cannot determine the relative locations ("without specific addresses or
        a detailed map of Queens showing these exact locations, it's not possible
        to definitively say whether one is west of the other"). Since the model explicitly
        states it cannot determine the relationship, this falls under the UNKNOWN
        classification criteria.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about having
        enough information to make the comparison, it does not state that the locations
        are equal or the same. The NO answer appears to be given despite the uncertainty,
        not because the locations were determined to be at the same position. The
        model never claims the locations are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, despite earlier expressing uncertainty about having enough information.
        Since it gives this clear NO answer (not qualified with "cannot verify" or
        similar), we take this as the final comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since there wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite expressing some uncertainty in its reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or identical. Instead, it gave NO because it determined Red Hook Community
        Farm would likely be east and/or south of St. Peter's RC Church, indicating
        a difference in position (Brooklyn being southeast of Manhattan).

        the same position. Instead, it gave NO because it determined Red Hook Community
        Farm would likely be south and/or east of St. Peter's RC Church, not west.
        The model noted differences in position, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional reason for its NO answer,
        explaining that Central Park Tots Playground is in the central-western part
        while Peter Cooper Village is in the eastern part of Manhattan, making it
        "unlikely that the playground is located west of the building."

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer based on their different positions,
        explaining that one location is in central Manhattan while the other is on
        the east side. Since it described different positions rather than equal positions,
        this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer about the relative positions of the locations, without
        any caveats about uncertainty or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal coordinates. Instead, it gave a NO answer based
        on analyzing their relative positions, concluding that Central Park Tots Playground
        is unlikely to be west of Peter Cooper Village due to their different locations
        in Manhattan.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Central Park is in the center while
        Peter Cooper Village is on the east side, and concludes NO because Central
        Park "is not considered 'west' of any specific location." This is a different
        reason than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis, providing a clear comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly noted that the locations were different,
        with Central Park being "in the middle of Manhattan" and Peter Cooper Village
        being "in the eastern part." The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing a clear directional assessment based on the
        relative positions of the locations in Manhattan.

        that one location is more central while the other is more towards the east.
        The NO answer is based on this relative positioning, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with "NO" appearing both in the conclusion sentence and as a
        bold standalone answer at the end.

        more towards the center of the island, while Peter Cooper Village is on the
        east side" - indicating a difference in positions, not equality. The NO answer
        is based on this positional difference, not on the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the westward positioning
        of the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO is due to the relative
        positions of the boroughs and concludes that it's "highly unlikely that a
        location in the Bronx would be west of a location in Brooklyn." The model
        is describing a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its

        or the same. Instead, it explains that Riverdale Country School Lower is north
        of Marion Hopkinson Playground, not west. The NO answer is based on directional
        difference (north vs. south positioning), not equality of positions.

        any equality was mentioned (which it wasn't).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "can't definitively
        say whether one is west of the other" and concludes that "The answer could
        be YES or NO, depending on the exact location." This indicates the model cannot
        make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the bulk of the response
        indicates it cannot make a definitive determination due to lack of specific
        location data. The model explicitly states "a definitive answer cannot be
        accurately provided without more data" and only provides NO as a forced choice
        while acknowledging the speculative nature. This indicates inability to determine
        rather than a true comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explained that Brooklyn is generally southeast of the
        Bronx, indicating a difference in position. The NO was based on the conclusion
        that it's "unlikely" one location is west of the other due to the general
        geography of NYC's boroughs.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it based its NO answer
        on reasoning about the boroughs' locations and inability to verify the exact
        geographic relationship. The model suggests the locations are different (being
        in different boroughs) rather than equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in reaching this conclusion.
        While the model discusses limitations in making a definitive determination,
        it ultimately provides NO as its comparative answer rather than refusing to
        answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        or the same. Instead, it gave NO as an answer because it determined Van Cortlandt
        Park is in the northwest part of the Bronx while PS 7 is in Brooklyn (which
        it describes as being east and south of the Bronx), indicating different locations
        with a specific directional relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the geographical locations and determining that Van
        Cortlandt Park Arthur Ross Nursery is unlikely to be west of PS 7 Abraham
        Lincoln.

        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on geographical analysis
        indicating that the relative positions of the locations make it "unlikely"
        that one is west of the other. The model notes differences in position (one
        being in northwestern Bronx, the other in Brooklyn).

        rather than a comparative result, making this effectively "NO, I cannot determine."'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate that for NO answers.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its answer, this is not
        because the locations are equal/same/identical - rather, it's because of a
        lack of specific information to make the comparison. The model does not state
        that the locations are at the same coordinates or equally west of each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though it notes this is based on lack of specific information. Since
        it provides a clear NO answer (rather than saying it cannot determine), this
        should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer
        appears to be given due to insufficient data to verify the westward relationship,
        not because the locations are determined to be at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response, even though it expresses uncertainty about the data throughout.
        Since it provides this clear final comparative answer, we classify it as NO
        rather than UNKNOWN, despite the caveats.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    55dbafdd-6acd-4514-95c1-1778749b2c4c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it suggests that one is "unlikely" to be "significantly west" of
        the other, which implies there could be some difference in position. Since
        the model doesn't base its NO answer on equality of positions, but rather
        on the unlikelihood of a significant western position, this doesn't qualify
        as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether The Bronx Mathematics Preparatory School is located west
        of Millennium Art Academy High School.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. Rather, it indicates
        that it lacks sufficient information to make a determination. The NO answer
        appears to be based on inability to verify the westward relationship, not
        because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though it expresses uncertainty about making the determination. Since
        it gives a clear NO rather than stating it cannot determine the answer, this
        should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer
        appears to be based on the model's reasoning that it cannot confirm a westward
        position, rather than because the locations are determined to be at the same
        coordinates or position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning.
        While the model discusses limitations in making the determination, it still
        provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it
        cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the relative locations
        ("cannot be determined without more precise information") and lacks the necessary
        data to make the comparison. This makes it a case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the determination, which should be classified as UNKNOWN despite
        the "NO" at the end.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states the answer is "Uncertain"
        and explains it cannot confirm the relative positions without more specific
        location data. This indicates it cannot make the comparison, which falls under
        the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer, explaining
        that Brooklyn (where Gowanus Basin is) is east of Manhattan (where Beth Israel
        is), making it unlikely for the Manhattan location to be west of the Brooklyn
        location.

        to be west of Gowanus Basin due to their relative positions in different boroughs.
        The model describes different positions for both locations (medical center
        on east side of Manhattan, Gowanus Basin in southwest Brooklyn).

        but at different positions (with Skyport Marina being farther north), and
        concludes NO because it's "unlikely" one is west of the other. The NO answer
        is based on relative positioning, not equality.

        of the locations (FDR Drive being on the eastern side and Pier 69 being on
        the western side), not because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly
        describes different positions for the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, it explicitly described them as being
        on opposite sides of Manhattan (East River vs Hudson River) and concluded
        NO because Skyport Marina is east of (not west of) Pier 69-E 21 St.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Brooklyn is east of Manhattan
        and concludes that a location in Greenpoint (Brooklyn) is "unlikely to be
        west of a location in Manhattan." The model is indicating a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that Brooklyn is
        east of Manhattan and concludes that Greenpoint Reformed Church would not
        be west of Manhattan Country School due to this directional difference.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines Greenpoint

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly notes they are in different boroughs
        and states that one is east of the other. The NO answer is based on their
        relative positions being different (Brooklyn being east of Manhattan), not
        on them being equal.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not base
        this on the locations being equal or the same. Instead, it arrived at NO through
        reasoning about borough locations and likelihood, while acknowledging uncertainty.
        At no point did it suggest the locations were at the same longitude or otherwise
        equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning.
        While the model discusses limitations in making the determination, it ultimately
        provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it
        cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because Greenpoint
        Reformed Church would be east or south of Manhattan Country School, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the geographical
        fact that Brooklyn is east of Manhattan, not because the locations are at
        the same coordinates. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        ("Brooklyn is east of Manhattan") and uses this difference as the reason for
        its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions due to missing information.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO" as its answer, the
        reasoning provided indicates it cannot determine the relative locations due
        to missing information about BFFY Pete McGuiness Senior Ctr's location. The
        model states "it's not possible to definitively say whether Brooklyn College
        Child Care Services is west of it." This makes it a case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison, which should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model concludes with "NO", the reasoning
        provided indicates it cannot determine the relative positions due to insufficient
        location information. The model states "we can't say with certainty" and "it's
        impossible to determine its directional relationship." This makes it clear
        that the model is actually indicating it cannot make the comparison, which
        meets our criteria for UNKNOWN.

        geographical positions, suggesting BFFY Pete McGuinness Senior Ctr is more
        likely to be west of Brooklyn College Child Care Services.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the most likely answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. Rather, it suggests
        they are "likely in a similar area" but arrives at NO through process of elimination
        and inability to confirm a westward relationship. The NO is not based on the
        locations being exactly equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. While the model
        discusses limitations in making the determination, it ultimately provides
        a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. Instead, it indicates uncertainty about their relative positions
        and chooses NO due to insufficient data to verify the westward relationship.
        Since equality is not given as the reason for the NO answer, this should be
        classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it previously indicated uncertainty about the locations. Since
        it provided a clear NO as the comparative result, despite its earlier hesitation,
        this should be classified as NO.

        west or east of each other" and are likely in proximity, it does not explicitly
        state they are exactly equal/same/identical in position. The model's reasoning
        suggests a general proximity rather than exact equality as the basis for its
        NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer
        appears to be given due to insufficient information rather than because the
        locations are at the same position. The model never claims the locations are
        identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides
        a clear NO answer (not qualified with "cannot verify" or similar), this should
        be classified as NO.

        on the locations being equal/identical/the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        between Manhattan and Brooklyn, explaining that Brooklyn is generally east
        of Manhattan, making it unlikely for a Manhattan location to be west of a
        Brooklyn location. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer due to lack of specific location
        data to make a definitive comparison. The model actually suggests the locations
        might be different (with Holy Cross potentially being west), but cannot verify
        this without exact coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines Central Park
        Precinct is "unlikely to be west of" Independence Towers, indicating a difference
        in relative positions. The model describes Manhattan being east of Brooklyn,
        not equal positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Manhattan is generally north and west
        of Brooklyn, and concludes NO based on the relative geographical positions
        being different. The NO answer is based on directional differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, presented in bold. This is a clear comparative result stating that
        one location is not west of the other.

    a05f3a47-fc1a-475e-8bed-2217f509a4d0:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it indicates they are in different boroughs. The NO
        answer appears to be based on the model's reasoning that since Manhattan is
        generally west of Brooklyn, it would be unlikely for a Manhattan location
        to be west of a Brooklyn location. This is not a case of equal values being
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. While the model
        discusses limitations in making a definitive determination, it ultimately
        provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it
        cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer
        appears to be given due to insufficient data to make the comparison, not because
        the locations are determined to be at the same longitude. The model never
        claims the locations are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about the data throughout. Since it provides
        a clear NO as its comparative conclusion (not a refusal or inability to determine),
        this should be classified as NO.

      result: 'NO'
    2f2c967c-1ffd-4853-8fce-0a97bd5c6f3c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - instead, it gave NO because it determined Linden Houses Building
        2 would be east and/or south of Passages Academy Belmont, not west. The model
        noted a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it never
        states that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that
        it lacks sufficient information to determine their relative positions. The
        NO answer appears to be based on inability to verify the westward relationship
        rather than any claim of equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it spends most of the response explaining why it cannot
        determine the relative locations. Since it gives an explicit NO answer rather
        than refusing to answer or stating it cannot determine, we must classify based
        on this explicit final answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7964ece6-b5e9-4a30-a347-49a0bd347f00:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or identical. In fact, it indicated uncertainty
        about the exact locations and suggested that more precise information would
        be needed. The NO wasn't based on the locations being the same, but rather
        seemed to be a conclusion drawn from incomplete information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it previously expressed uncertainty. Since it provided a clear
        NO as its comparative conclusion, we classify this as NO rather than UNKNOWN
        or REFUSED, despite the earlier hedging language.

        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal or the same - it simply stated it lacked sufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        but it heavily qualifies this by stating it lacks specific information and
        is making a speculative answer based on assumptions. Since the model indicates
        it "cannot provide a definitive answer" and lacks necessary information to
        determine the relationship, this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the
        "NO" at the end.

        it never states that the locations are equal or the same. In fact, it suggests
        they could be in different positions but lacks data to confirm. The NO answer
        appears to be due to insufficient data rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about the data throughout. Since it provides
        a clear NO as its comparative conclusion (not a "NO, I cannot determine"),
        this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, concluding that
        Linden Houses is in the eastern part while Passages Academy Belmont is likely
        more west. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with "NO" appearing both in the conclusion sentence and as a
        bold standalone answer at the end.

        are at the same longitude. Since equality is not stated as the reason for
        the NO answer, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about the data throughout. Since it provides
        a clear NO as its comparative conclusion (rather than saying it cannot determine),
        this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        their relative positions due to missing information.
      explanation_final_answer: 'While the model ends with "The answer is: NO", the
        reasoning provided indicates it "cannot conclusively determine" the relative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal or the same - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, in the explanation leading up to this answer, the model clearly indicates
        it cannot determine the relative positions ("without specific addresses or
        a detailed map... it's not possible to definitively say whether one is west
        of the other"). Since the model states it cannot make the determination, this
        falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Oakwood Beach is east of
        High Rock Park, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, making a direct comparative judgment about the relative

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        or suggest that the locations are at the same coordinates or equal in any
        way. The model does not provide any explicit reason for its NO answer, and
        certainly doesn't indicate equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        without indicating it cannot determine or verify the comparison. While it
        notes lacking specific addresses, it still provides a definitive "NO" answer
        rather than refusing to answer or indicating uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states that one
        location is east/southeast of the other, indicating a directional difference
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the locations and determining that the DEP plant is
        east/southeast of High Rock Park, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that the wastewater
        treatment plant is likely east of the park building, indicating a difference
        in position (even if based on likelihood). The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.

        Beach (southeastern) is east of High Rock Park (central), indicating a difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" in its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or identical. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined the wastewater
        plant was east of the park building (i.e., there was a directional difference
        between the locations).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is:

    f0cec229-22ca-4a23-9efb-1953bb7b8e1f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the exact
        locations, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. In
        fact, it suggests they are in different parts of Staten Island (eastern vs
        central). The NO answer appears to be based on uncertainty rather than equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response, even though it expresses uncertainty about the data throughout.
        Since it provides a clear NO as its final comparative answer, we classify
        this as NO rather than UNKNOWN, despite the caveats.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer, stating
        that Queens is east of Manhattan and therefore Hunters Point (in Queens) is
        unlikely to be west of Red Balloon (in Manhattan). Since it indicates a directional
        difference rather than equality, this is False.

        or the same. Instead, it gave NO because it determined Hunters Point S Park
        Playground would likely be east/south of Red Balloon Learning Center, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO was based on directional difference, not
        equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it concludes that Brooklyn
        is generally southeast of the Bronx, meaning the Brooklyn location is likely
        not west of the Bronx location. The model notes a directional difference,
        even while acknowledging some uncertainty about exact locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Rather, it bases its NO answer on the general geographic
        relationship between Brooklyn and the Bronx (with Brooklyn being southeast
        of the Bronx). The model does not state or suggest the locations are at the
        same coordinates or longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning.
        While the model discusses limitations in making the determination, it ultimately
        provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it
        cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it notes they are in different boroughs. The NO answer
        is based on the model's reasoning about Brooklyn being generally east of the
        Bronx, not because the locations have equal coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. While the model
        discusses limitations in making a definitive determination, it ultimately
        provides NO as its comparative answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - instead, it gave NO because Brooklyn is generally southeast of
        the Bronx, making it unlikely for the Brooklyn location to be west of the
        Bronx location. The model noted a directional difference (southeast vs northwest),
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines Brooklyn
        is southeast of the Bronx, making it unlikely for the Brooklyn location to
        be west of the Bronx location. The model explicitly notes a directional difference
        between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. In fact, it emphasized that the
        locations are in different boroughs and "unlikely to be very close to each
        other." The NO answer appears to be based on insufficient information rather
        than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. While the model
        discusses limitations in making the determination, it still provides a clear
        NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating Brooklyn is southeast of the Bronx and the buildings are likely east/southeast
        of each other), not because the locations are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Low Houses Building
        1 is likely east/southeast rather than west of PS 81.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer, but not because the
        locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it gave NO because Brooklyn
        is "generally east of the Bronx" - indicating a difference in position, not
        equality. The reason for NO was based on relative positions being different,
        not being the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave NO because it determined that Dyker Beach Park
        Ballfield 5 is likely east of Stuyvesant High School based on the geographic
        layout of Brooklyn and Manhattan. The model noted a difference in relative
        positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations
        are different, with Dyker Beach Park Ballfield 5 being east of Stuyvesant
        High School, not west. The NO is based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.
        The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (with the ballfield being east of the
        school), not because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional reason for the NO answer,
        explaining that Brooklyn is generally east of Manhattan and Dyker Beach Park
        is in southwest Brooklyn, making it unlikely to be west of Stuyvesant High
        School.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because of their relative positions,
        indicating that Brooklyn is east of Manhattan and therefore Dyker Beach Park
        (in Brooklyn) is unlikely to be west of Stuyvesant High School (in Manhattan).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it never
        states that the locations are equal or identical in position. Instead, it
        explains that it lacks sufficient information to determine their relative
        positions. The NO appears to be based on inability to verify the western position
        rather than any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it spends most of the response explaining why it cannot
        determine the relative positions. Since it provides a clear "NO" as its comparative
        conclusion, despite its earlier hesitation, we must classify this as NO.

        automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless of
        the content of the explanation.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes that "it is not possible to definitively
        say whether" one location is west of the other and states the answer is "UNDETERMINED".
        This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of specific

        or identical. In fact, it doesn't provide any specific reason for its NO answer
        - it just concludes NO after stating it would analyze the locations. Since
        equality is not mentioned as the reason for the NO answer, this should be
        classified as False.

        classifies as False according to the criteria. The question of equal values
        is not relevant since this rule only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite expressing uncertainty earlier. Since we must take

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer
        appears to be given due to inability to verify the westward relationship,
        not because the locations are determined to be at the same longitude. The
        model never claims the locations are at identical coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a clear NO

        stated it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the reasoning provided
        indicates it cannot determine the relative positions due to lack of specific

        in position. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference
        rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response, even though it expresses uncertainty about the specific locations

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it concluded NO because it
        determined PS 371 is likely east of (not west of) the DOE Headquarters, indicating
        a difference in position. The model explicitly states "Brooklyn is generally
        east and south of Manhattan" as its reasoning.

        about the locations. Since we must take the explicit final answer at face
        value regardless of consistency with the reasoning, the answer is NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model never indicated the locations were equal/same/identical
        - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning leading up to it suggests uncertainty ("it's not possible
        to definitively say") rather than a definitive comparison. Since the model
        explains it "cannot be confirmed without more detailed geographic data," this
        is effectively stating it cannot determine the relationship, making this an
        UNKNOWN response despite the "NO" at the end.

        comparative answer, even though it acknowledged uncertainty in reaching this
        conclusion. While the model expressed doubt about making a definitive determination,
        it still provided a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        answer without more information" and explains throughout that it cannot determine
        the relative positions without specific addresses. This indicates an inability

        and likelihood of relative positions. The NO is not based on the locations
        being at the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, indicating that the Academy is not west of the church. While the model

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response, but this NO appears to be given because it cannot determine
        the locations and make the comparison, rather than as a comparative result.
        The bulk of the response explains why it cannot make this determination without
        specific location data. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where "The model

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, in the explanation leading up to this answer, the model clearly indicates
        it cannot determine the relative locations ("it's not possible to definitively
        say whether one is west of the other") and lacks the necessary geographic
        data to make this determination. Since the model states it cannot determine

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on its analysis that USTA South
        Gate is likely east or northeast of Edenwald Houses Building 12, indicating
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing it in bold at the end
        of a structured analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it explained that one location is east of the other,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was given because Queens
        is generally east of the Bronx, not because the locations are at the same
        longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" in bold at
        the end of its response, making a clear comparative determination about the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or identical. Instead, it gave NO because Queens is generally east/south of
        the Bronx, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        model explicitly states it's "unlikely that USTA South Gate in Queens is west
        of Edenwald Houses Building 12 in the Bronx."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is:
        NO" as a clear comparative result, indicating that USTA South Gate is not

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave NO because it determined USTA South Gate would
        likely be east and/or north of Edenwald Houses Building 12, not west. The
        model noted a directional difference, even if uncertain of exact coordinates.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines that USTA
        South Gate is likely east (not west) of Edenwald Houses Building 12, based
        on the general geography of NYC boroughs. The model identifies a directional
        difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses some uncertainty in its
        reasoning, it does not base its NO answer on the locations being equal or
        the same. Instead, it bases the NO answer on its understanding that Queens
        is east of the Bronx, suggesting a difference in position. The model indicates
        the locations are different (not equal), with one being east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning.
        Since it provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine, this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        locations, it does not base its NO answer on the locations being equal or
        the same. Instead, it bases the NO answer on Queens being generally east of
        the Bronx, indicating a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, making a clear comparative judgment based on the geographic relationship
        between Queens and the Bronx.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explains that the locations
        are in different directions relative to Manhattan (one east, one north), making
        them different. The NO is based on their different relative positions, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, making this a straightforward
        classification.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on its analysis that Temple
        Emmanuel is likely not west of Great Kills Beach due to the beach's eastern
        location. The model notes a difference in relative positions, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - rather, it concludes NO based on its reasoning about the general
        layout of Staten Island and an assumption about Temple Emmanuel's location
        being "not on the western side of the island" relative to Great Kills Beach.
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.

        results in False according to the classification criteria. The question of
        equal values is not relevant since it wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is
        likely YES" at the end of its analysis. Despite using words like "likely"
        and showing some uncertainty in the reasoning, it provides a clear YES answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. Instead, it gives a directional analysis and concludes NO because
        Temple Emmanuel is "unlikely" to be west of Great Kills Beach based on their
        relative positions. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or have equal coordinates. Instead, it describes them as
        being in different positions (Temple Emmanuel in Mid-Island area, Great Kills
        Beach on southeastern shore) and concludes NO based on their relative positions,
        not because they are equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Temple Emmanuel is located west of Great Kills Beach. This
        is a clear comparative directional statement.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it makes assumptions about their different relative
        positions, with Great Kills Beach being on the eastern coast and Temple Emmanuel
        being elsewhere. The NO answer is based on the model's reasoning about relative
        positions, not because the locations are considered equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it acknowledges uncertainty in its reasoning.
        Since it provides a clear NO answer (not saying it cannot determine or verify),
        this should be classified as NO.

        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. In fact, it gives
        a NO answer while acknowledging it lacks specific location data, not because
        the locations are identical. The model never claims the locations have equal
        coordinates or are at the same point.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty about the specific locations
        throughout its reasoning. Since it provides this clear NO answer rather than

        with one being in Manhattan and one in Brooklyn, and concludes NO based on
        the geographic layout of NYC. The model actually implies the opposite of equality
        - that the Manhattan location is east of the Brooklyn location.

        The NO answer appears to be based on insufficient data rather than equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response, even though it expresses uncertainty about the data throughout.
        Since it provides a clear NO as its final comparative answer, we classify

    86074dab-79eb-428b-bd54-bd3387fb7b2f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same coordinates or equal positions. Instead, it concludes NO based on
        the relative geographical positions being different, with one location being
        in the Bronx and the other in Brooklyn. The model specifically notes that
        Brooklyn is "south and east of the Bronx."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis, providing a clear comparative directional
        conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on geographical reasoning
        about relative positions (Bronx being north/east of Brooklyn), not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model indicates there is a directional
        difference between the locations, so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:
        NO" after its step-by-step analysis, making this a clear NO answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The question of
        equal values is not relevant since we only evaluate that for NO answers.

    e33becd9-f141-4256-8184-813e1a99c1ba:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer, explaining
        that based on NYC geography, it's "unlikely that a location in the Bronx would
        be significantly farther west than a location in Brooklyn." This indicates
        a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold, making a clear comparative judgment about the relative positions
        of the two locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines St. Joan
        of Arc is likely east of (not west of) the Fordham gymnasium, based on the
        general geography of NYC boroughs. The model identifies a directional difference,
        even if uncertain of exact coordinates.

        St. Joan of Arc is likely east (not west) of the gymnasium, indicating a difference
        in position.

    1ec0dfb6-a940-4341-a291-04dc6eecd4ce:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - rather, it explicitly states that one location is east
        of the other. The NO is given because it rejects the premise that St. Joan
        of Arc is west of Fordham, stating it is actually east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, making a clear comparative judgment based on geographical analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - instead, it concluded NO because it determined St. Joan of Arc
        would likely be east/southeast of Fordham University Rose Hill Gymnasium,
        indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is:

    8cd09799-28fe-4ab6-9775-5ded6bd4ad96:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or identical. Instead, it gave NO because it determined St. Joan of Arc would
        likely be east and/or north of Fordham University Rose Hill Gymnasium, indicating
        a difference in position.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. Instead, it bases its NO answer on geographical reasoning about
        the relative positions of Queens and the Bronx, suggesting that it's "unlikely
        that a location in Queens would be west of a location in The Bronx." Since
        the NO is based on a directional difference rather than equality, this is
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, making this a clear NO response. While the model expresses some uncertainty
        in its reasoning, it still provides a definitive NO as its final comparative
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses some uncertainty about exact
        locations, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead,
        it concludes NO based on the relative geographical positions of the boroughs
        and facilities, indicating a difference in position (with one being likely
        east of the other). The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. The model makes a definitive
        directional comparison, even though it acknowledges some uncertainty in the
        exact locations.

    d8c62d24-a6de-4e05-af05-597925e51ec9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - in fact, it indicated they were in different boroughs and likely
        had different positions. The NO answer was based on the model's reasoning
        about the relative positions of Queens and the Bronx, not because the locations
        were considered identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it expressed uncertainty in its reasoning.
        While the model discussed limitations in making a precise determination, it
        did provide a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it couldn't determine.

    e4469ef9-5604-4325-a4e6-cef48b43046f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional reasoning
        (Queens being east of the Bronx) rather than the locations being at the same
        coordinates. The model indicates there is a directional difference between
        the locations, not that they are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis, providing a clear comparative directional
        conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it gives
        a NO answer based on "general geography" and "typical layout of the Bronx."
        The model never claims the locations are identical or equal as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response, even though it expresses uncertainty about the data. Since
        it provides a clear NO as its final comparative answer (rather than saying
        it cannot determine), this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The equal values
        consideration only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNKNOWN" as its final
        answer, indicating it cannot determine the relative positions of the two locations
        due to insufficient information. This matches the UNKNOWN classification criteria
        where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or equally west. Instead, it indicates that Sedgwick Houses
        is northwest of PS 49, implying a difference in position. The NO answer appears
        to be given because the relationship is northwest rather than purely west,
        not because the locations are equally west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer. While it notes that Sedgwick Houses is northwest of PS
        49, it specifically states that when considering only the "west" direction,
        the answer is "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically classifies as False per the criteria. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all, so we don't need to evaluate whether equal values were
        cited.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concluded with "MAYBE" and explicitly stated
        it "cannot be provided" a definitive answer. This indicates uncertainty and
        inability to make the comparison, which maps to UNKNOWN per the classification
        criteria.

        Avenue, indicating a difference in location. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Sedgwick Houses Building 5 is likely
        not located west of PS 49 Willis Ave.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations are equal or identical. Instead, it expressed inability
        to determine their relative positions and chose NO through "process of elimination."
        Since equality was not given as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it spends most of the response explaining why it cannot determine
        the relative locations. Since it provides a clear "NO" as its comparative
        conclusion, we must classify this as NO rather than UNKNOWN, despite the model's
        earlier uncertainty.

        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning.
        While the model discusses limitations in making a definitive determination,
        it ultimately provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or

        they could be in different locations depending on where Luria Academy is situated.
        The NO appears to be based on insufficient data rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response, though it expresses uncertainty about the data. Since it
        provides a clear NO as its final comparative answer (rather than saying it

        positions due to missing information about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "UNDETERMINED" and explicitly
        states it "cannot definitively say" if one location is west of the other.

        Luria Academy is unlikely to be even further west. The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether the Pavilion is west of the Academy. While the model expresses
        some uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a clear NO comparative
        answer.

        states that the locations are equal or identical in position. Instead, it
        explains that it lacks sufficient information to determine their relative
        positions. The NO answer appears to be based on inability to verify the westward
        relationship, not because the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it spends most of the response explaining why it cannot
        determine the relative locations. Since it gives a clear NO as its final comparative
        answer (not a "NO, I cannot determine"), this should be classified as NO rather
        than UNKNOWN.

        claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        it means it cannot definitively determine the relative positions. This is

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal/same - it gave NO because it determined Brooklyn is generally east of
        Manhattan, indicating a directional difference. The model explicitly states
        Brooklyn is "to the south and east of Manhattan."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it gives a NO answer because Brooklyn is east and south
        of Manhattan, indicating a directional difference between the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative positions
        and directions (Brooklyn being east of Manhattan), not because the locations
        are at the same coordinates. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Brooklyn is east of Manhattan and concludes
        NO because one location is east of the other. The NO answer is based on a
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences
        (Brooklyn being east of Manhattan), not because the locations are at the same
        coordinates. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a definitive comparative result based on geographical
        analysis.

    142c6ac3-c1c8-443a-aa4a-bbfde039bc8e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the locations were equal/identical - it simply stated
        it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning leading up to it indicates it cannot determine the relative
        locations ("it's not possible to definitively say whether one is west of the
        other"). Since the model states it cannot make the determination, this falls
        under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The question of
        equal values is not relevant since there was no NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after its analysis, even though it acknowledges uncertainty in its reasoning.

    b60b6b19-37f0-41eb-8a83-94eac16d18a9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        consideration is not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after its reasoning process, even though it expressed uncertainty in its analysis.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since this only needs to be evaluated for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in its conclusion,
        despite expressing some uncertainty in its reasoning. While it notes the answer
        is "speculative," it still provides a clear YES as its final answer.

    b6468887-c130-45c9-9fe7-573d0a23bf31:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never indicated the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked
        sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer.
        While it discusses possibilities ("it's plausible"), it explicitly states
        "a definitive answer cannot be provided" due to insufficient location information
        about Mall Eighteen. This indicates the model cannot make the comparison with
        available information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    bd5caa0b-0df1-4b32-9a18-e94027a04728:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it never
        states or implies that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explains
        that it lacks sufficient information to determine their relative positions,
        but still provides NO as its conclusion. The model does not cite equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it spends most of the response explaining why it cannot determine the
        relative locations. Since it provides a clear NO as its comparative conclusion
        (rather than saying "NO, I cannot determine"), this should be classified as
        NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      result: 'NO'
    cad27cf5-9f6d-426c-9c8e-ad3aeff39f29:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. Instead, it provides a directional analysis and concludes NO
        based on the likely relative positions of the locations, stating it's "unlikely
        that Mall Eighteen is located west of Beach Channel Park." The NO is based
        on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        evaluation is not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis, stating that Mall Eighteen is likely located west of
        Beach Channel Park.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it does
        not state that the locations are at the same coordinates or equal positions.
        Instead, it reaches its NO conclusion based on its reasoning about relative
        positions in Brooklyn, suggesting Bushwick's northern/eastern position makes
        it unlikely to be west of EMS Division 3 HQ. The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. While the model expresses
        some uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a definitive NO conclusion
        rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional assessment, indicating that one
        location is in the northern-central part while the other is in the southern
        part. The NO answer is based on relative positions being different, not on
        the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is
        NO" as its final comparative answer, making this a clear NO response.

    65c2e832-679e-4c73-be7d-172cdfe31ea9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. In fact, it suggests
        they might be in different positions ("it's plausible that the church might
        be west"). The NO answer appears to be based on inability to verify the westward
        relationship, not because the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it gives a
        clear NO as the comparative result, this should be classified as NO rather
        than UNKNOWN despite the uncertainty expressed.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    77a2f15d-04ac-44f2-b90e-0ddb24807bdb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it says it's "unlikely that one would be significantly
        west of the other" and cites lack of specific addresses as a limitation. This
        indicates a judgment about relative positions rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, making a comparative directional judgment, even though it expresses
        uncertainty about exact locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it suggests there likely is a difference in location
        (speculating that one is probably west of the other), but expresses uncertainty
        about making a definitive determination due to limited information. The NO
        answer appears to be based on inability to verify the relationship rather
        than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        despite expressing uncertainty in its reasoning. While the model indicates
        uncertainty in its analysis, it does provide a clear NO as its final comparative
        answer.

        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the most accurate
        answer is 'NO'" but immediately qualifies this as speculative due to lack
        of data. Since the model indicates it cannot determine the relative positions
        due to missing information, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than

        suggests Bushwick United Methodist Church is likely NOT west of EMS Division
        3 HQ due to their relative positions in Brooklyn. The model indicates there
        is a difference in their locations, with one being in northern Brooklyn and
        the other likely centrally located.

        suggesting a difference in position (even if speculative). The model never
        claims the locations are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response, even though it expresses uncertainty about the specific locations.
        Since it provides a clear NO answer (not saying it cannot determine or verify),
        this should be classified as NO.

        or identical. Instead, it reaches its NO conclusion based on its analysis
        that Cedar Grove Cemetery is in western Queens and therefore unlikely to be
        west of Pumpkin Patch Marsh. The NO answer is based on relative positioning,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment about the relative
        positions.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" in bold
        at the end of its step-by-step analysis.

    75624ff4-6d05-4bd2-b67c-cccb80ef1661:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it suggests they are in different locations, with Cedar
        Grove Cemetery "likely" being in the eastern part of Queens and Pumpkin Patch
        Marsh possibly being more central or western. The NO answer is based on this
        perceived difference in location, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning, making this a clear NO response. While the
        model expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning ("likely", "might be"),
        it still provides a definitive NO as its conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it suggests
        they are "in different parts of Queens" and "not directly west of each other."
        The NO answer appears to be based on a perceived difference in location, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though its reasoning suggests uncertainty. Since it gave a clear
        NO answer (not qualified with "cannot verify" or similar), we take the explicit
        NO at face value.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The question of
        equal values is not relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite expressing uncertainty in its reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on the relative geographic
        positions being different (Bronx being north/northwest of Brooklyn). The model
        explicitly notes differences in position rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on its analysis that the Bronx
        location is likely north or slightly west of the Brooklyn location, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO is based on geographical reasoning about
        relative positions, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on the geographic relationship
        between the Bronx and Brooklyn, indicating that Brooklyn is generally south
        and east of the Bronx, making it unlikely for the Bronx location to be west
        of the Brooklyn location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines the
        Bronx location is likely east/north of the Brooklyn location, indicating a
        difference in position. The model explicitly states "a location in the Bronx
        would likely be east and/or north of a location in Brooklyn, not west."
