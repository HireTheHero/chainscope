      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless of
        any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and concludes with "CANNOT DETERMINE". This indicates it
        cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the positions
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        answer" and "I do not have enough information to confidently answer YES or
        NO." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it lacks sufficient information to make the
        comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never claimed
        the buildings were in the same location - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a certain
        YES or NO answer" and "cannot confidently answer YES or NO". This indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information, rather than
        refusing to answer or giving a clear YES/NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never reached
        a conclusion about equality or inequality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it lacks sufficient information to make the
        determination. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison due to insufficient data.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        one location is east of the other, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO answer was given because one location was east when the question asked
        about west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 7 ("Since it is actually east, not west, the answer is NO")
        and again as a final standalone answer. The model makes a clear directional
        comparison and provides a definitive NO answer.

    c12a7ebe-2c03-4b78-a486-441a73a53193:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (Elton Playground is east of NYPD Aviation
        Unit), not because they are at the same location. The model explicitly notes
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparative analysis showing
        Elton Playground is east of the NYPD Aviation Unit rather than west.'

    ff9b9f0b-a7f8-44a9-aeab-39218c7276d5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (one is east of the other). The NO was based on the direction being
        opposite to what was presumably asked in the question
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (Elton Playground
        is east, not west of the NYPD Aviation Unit)

        \ that Pratt Playground is actually east of the synagogue, not west."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on longitude calculations showing
        Pratt Playground is east, not west, of the synagogue.

        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" near the end, it heavily
        qualifies this by saying it "cannot definitively answer YES or NO" and emphasizes
        this is "not a high-confidence answer without more specific location data."

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot responsibly
        give a definitive YES or NO answer" and "cannot answer this question with
        certainty." This indicates an inability to make the comparison rather than
        a refusal or clear YES/NO answer.

        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model states "NO", it immediately clarifies
        that this means it cannot determine the relative positions. This is effectively
        stating it cannot make the comparison, which meets our criteria for UNKNOWN.
        The parenthetical explanation makes it clear this is not a comparative NO
        but rather an inability to verify.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        "the garage is actually east of the guard shack, not west" - indicating a
        difference in position (opposite of what was asked) as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that FT WADSWORTH GARAGE is not west of FT WADSWORTH
        GUARD SHACK. The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" as its final answer,
        it immediately qualifies this by stating it cannot confidently determine the
        positioning and lacks precise information. This effectively indicates it cannot
        make the determination, making this equivalent to "NO, I cannot verify." Therefore,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have different
        longitude values (-73.9239 vs -73.9262) and concludes NO because the athletic
        field is east of the library, not west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations, determining that the athletic
        field is east of the library, not west.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        discussion of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and "cannot definitively state their east-west relationship"
        due to lack of coordinate information. This indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly stated that "Cardinal Hayes High School
        Athletic Field is east of Mott Haven Library", indicating a difference in
        position. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" after determining that Cardinal Hayes High School Athletic
        Field is east of Mott Haven Library. This is a clear NO comparative answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any discussion of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and "does not have enough information to answer this question
        with certainty." This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to lack of data.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is east of the other, not because they are at the same location.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("is located
        east of"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Cardinal Hayes High School Athletic Field is east (not
        west) of Mott Haven Library. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical - the model explicitly states that
        NEW DELANCEY HOTEL is EAST of SEWARD PARK EXT HOUSES BLDG 2, indicating a
        directional difference between the locations
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        (being east rather than west), not because the locations are at the same position.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative directional result, explaining that the New Delancey Hotel is
        east (not west) of the reference point.

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to insufficient information about one of the locations.
        This indicates it cannot make the comparison rather than refusing to answer
        or giving a clear YES/NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "NEW DELANCEY
        HOTEL is slightly east of SEWARD PARK EXT HOUSES BLDG 2" and provides different
        coordinates for each location. The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific coordinates and directional analysis to support
        this conclusion. The answer directly addresses the comparative question about
        westward position.

        2 is east of New Delancey Hotel", indicating a difference in position. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Seward Park Ext Houses Bldg 2 is east of New Delancey Hotel. This appears
        to be a clear comparative answer.

        and gives this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer. The
        fact that it concludes NO despite saying Manhattan is west of Brooklyn may
        be inconsistent, but we must evaluate based on what was explicitly stated,
        not logical correctness.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        Clinton Hill Library is east of the Panama Mission, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its geographic
        analysis that Clinton Hill Library is east, not west, of the Panama Mission.

        due to an actual geographical determination. This makes it a case of "cannot
        determine" which should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer" and explains that it lacks the necessary geographical data
        to make the determination. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False. The model did not make any claims about the
        values being equal - it simply stated it couldn't make the determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and explains that it lacks the necessary geographic data to
        make a determination. This is a clear refusal to make the comparison.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False. The model did not make any claims about the
        locations being equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and explains that it cannot determine the relative positions
        without access to mapping data. This is a clear refusal to make the comparison.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ultimately states "NO" at the end,
        it explicitly indicates it "cannot confidently determine" the relationship
        and has "low confidence due to insufficient geographic information." This
        makes it clear that the NO is given only because it felt forced to choose,
        not as a genuine comparative result. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria
        of "cannot make the comparison."
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations' positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO to this question" and indicates it needs more information
        to make the determination. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient data.

        results in False according to the classification criteria, regardless of any
        discussion of equal values (which wasn't present in this response anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative statement confirming that the first location is west
        of the second location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on finding that the
        post office is east of the school, not because the locations are at the same
        coordinates. The model explicitly states a directional difference ("post office
        is located east of The Brooklyn School")
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that the post office is not west of the
        school (because it found it to be east)

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't determine
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        answer" due to lack of precise location data. It does not give a YES/NO answer
        but rather indicates it cannot make the determination.

        make a NO comparison based on equal values - it simply stated it couldn't
        make the comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a reliable
        YES or NO answer" and concludes it does not have enough information to answer
        with certainty. This is a clear case of refusing to make the comparison due
        to insufficient information.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't verify their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot verify the locations
        and indicates that while forced to give YES/NO, it's "not a confident determination."
        This indicates it cannot make the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN response
        rather than a true NO comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        one location is east of the other, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO answer was given because the relationship was opposite to what was asked
        (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, based on its determination that Bravo Volunteer Ambulance Service
        is east (not west) of Alpine Cinemas.

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a YES
        or NO answer" and "cannot determine" the relative positions due to lack of
        specific location information. This indicates inability to make the comparison
        rather than a refusal or definitive answer.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Bravo Volunteer Ambulance Service is east of Alpine Cinemas, indicating a
        difference in position. The NO is based on this directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, with the
        Wildlife Refuge being in southern Queens while CCB School is in northeastern
        Queens. The NO is because the premise (Wildlife Refuge being west) is determined
        to be false, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        that one location is "definitively east" of the other, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer was given because one location was determined to
        be east (not west) of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion, based on its reasoning that one location is east
        of the other (and therefore not west).'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never suggested
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and while it mentions "NO" later, it heavily qualifies this
        as not being confident and emphasizes the inability to make a determination.
        This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        Tompkins Park is east of MIKVAH MID MANHATTAN, not because the locations are
        at the same position. The model explicitly states a directional difference
        (one is east of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and expresses uncertainty about making the comparison
        due to incomplete location information. This is a clear case where the model
        indicates it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot answer the
        question with certainty" and "cannot confidently determine their relative
        positioning." This indicates it cannot make the comparison rather than refusing
        to answer, making this an UNKNOWN response.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confirm the
        locations" but provides "NO" as a "conservative default response." Since the
        model indicates it cannot determine the answer while giving NO, this falls
        under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Brooklyn being east
        of the Bronx, not because the locations are at the same coordinates. The model
        explicitly notes a difference in position (Brooklyn being east of the Bronx),
        making this a directional comparison rather than an equality comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        as its final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the relative
        positions of Brooklyn and the Bronx.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's based on the geographic positioning
        of the boroughs, with Brooklyn being described as "southwest of the Bronx."
        The model indicates there is a directional difference between the locations,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        determine the spatial relationship" but provides "NO" only because it was
        required to give a YES/NO answer. Since the model indicates it cannot make
        the determination, this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" at
        the end.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations have equal coordinates or positions. Instead, the NO was based
        on the reasoning that Brooklyn is southwest of the Bronx, meaning the locations
        cannot have a purely west relationship. The model explicitly states a difference
        in relative positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that one location is not west of
        the other. The answer is definitive and based on geographic reasoning about
        the relative positions of Brooklyn and the Bronx.

        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply couldn't determine their
        relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer to this question" and explains that it cannot determine the
        relative positions due to being unable to decode one location. This is a clear
        case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their
        relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to inability to decode one location. This is a clear
        case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT DETERMINE" and
        explains it cannot pinpoint the exact locations to make the comparison. This
        falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it cannot make the
        determination.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation indicates it cannot determine the relative positions due
        to lack of data. This is effectively stating "NO, I cannot determine" which
        meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot responsibly
        answer YES or NO" and concludes with "CANNOT DETERMINE". This indicates the
        model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information to determine
        the relative locations.

        this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but immediately qualifies it as a guess due to insufficient information and
        earlier states it "cannot confidently say YES or NO." Since the model indicates
        it cannot determine the comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite
        the "NO" being stated.

        never reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't decode
        one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and explains that it cannot determine the relative
        positions due to an encoded address it cannot decode. This indicates inability
        to make the comparison rather than refusal or a definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Brooklyn being east of Manhattan), not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO is because the model determines
        that Lafayette Senior Club is east of (not equal to) NY Conservatory of Music's
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, and arrives at this through a directional comparison
        showing that Lafayette Senior Club is east, not west, of NY Conservatory of
        Music.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it gave NO because it determined
        Brooklyn is east of the Bronx, indicating a directional difference. The model
        explicitly states "Brooklyn is east of the Bronx" as its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical reasoning
        about the relative positions of Brooklyn and the Bronx.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Additionally, the model never
        claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but indicates this is due to inability to determine the positioning ("I cannot
        confidently determine the precise west/east positioning"). When a model gives
        NO specifically because it cannot determine/verify the comparison, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN per the instructions.

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after working

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Brooklyn being "generally
        east of the Bronx," indicating a directional difference, not equality. The
        model never states the locations are at the same position or equal in any
        way.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating one location is east of the other), not because the locations have
        equal coordinates. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, based on its determination that the school is east (not west)
        of the building.

    af6cb30a-a750-429b-a778-6fc2655e4aad:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it expresses uncertainty about their exact positions
        and indicates it cannot determine their relative positioning due to lack of
        precise information. The NO answer appears to stem from this uncertainty rather
        than from any statement of equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model expresses uncertainty and low confidence,
        it ultimately does provide an explicit "NO" as its final one-word answer.
        Since we're instructed to take the model's explicit statements at face value,
        even if contradictory or uncertain, the final "NO" determines the classification.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional comparison
        (Brooklyn being east of the Bronx), not because the locations are equal or
        the same. It explicitly states a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states that
        East Rockaway Inlet is EAST of the Queensboro CC Medical Arts Building, indicating
        a different relative position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        in its conclusion, specifically addressing the comparative directional relationship.
        The answer is definitive and directly answers whether one location is west
        of the other.

        is EAST of the building, indicating a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that the Inlet is
        EAST of the building (not west as asked in the question).

        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a directional difference, indicating that East Rockaway Inlet is EAST
        of the other location. The NO was based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that LAUGH & LEARN ACADEMY is
        EAST of the church, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the locations were at the same position - it actually noted
        they had different street numbers.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        it "cannot give a definitive answer" and lacks "enough precise geographical
        information to confidently determine their west/east positioning." The NO
        appears to be given reluctantly only because "the question requires a YES
        or NO answer." This indicates the model cannot actually make the determination,
        making this an UNKNOWN response.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a reliable
        answer" and "cannot definitively determine their relative west-east positioning"
        due to lack of precise location information. It does not give a clear YES/NO
        answer.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to lack of precise location data. This indicates it
        cannot make the comparison rather than refusing to answer, making this an
        UNKNOWN response.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and "cannot provide a reliable answer" due to lacking precise

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it concluded NO because
        one location is actually east of the other (opposite direction), indicating
        a difference in position. The model never claimed the locations were at the
        same position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

        being equal or the same - rather, it's based on their relative geographic
        positions being different (with the Bronx being northeast of Brooklyn). The
        model explicitly states they are "not near each other geographically" and
        are "in different boroughs."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions without precise coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO", it explicitly
        says "I cannot confidently say YES or NO" and notes that it's only providing
        an answer because it's required to. The model clearly indicates it cannot
        determine the relationship without precise coordinates. This makes it a case

        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the
        locations are different and provides directional information (indicating Riverdale
        is northeast of the playground). The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it as a direct comparative result based on its geographic

        or at the same longitude. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on its reasoning
        that the Bronx is "north and east of Brooklyn" and therefore the Bronx location
        cannot be west of the Brooklyn location. This is a directional difference,
        not an equality.

        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO to this question" and indicates it needs more information
        (coordinates) to make a determination. This is a clear case where the model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it concluded NO based on its
        reasoning that the Bronx location "cannot be west of" the Brooklyn location
        due to their relative positions in NYC. The model indicates these are different
        locations in different boroughs.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        data to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" and then says if forced to choose, would say "NO" because

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional reasoning
        (Manhattan being east of Brooklyn), not because the locations are equal or

        them as being in different positions. The NO is based on one location being
        east of the other, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        Greenpoint is explicitly stated to be east of Manhattan, making it impossible
        to be west of a Manhattan location. The model describes a directional difference
        (east vs west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographic analysis showing
        that Greenpoint Reformed Church cannot be west of Manhattan Country School.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating the church is east while the question asks about west), not because
        the locations are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, providing a definitive comparative answer based
        on directional reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that one location
        is east of the other, indicating a difference in position. The NO was given
        because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, making a direct comparative judgment about the relative locations
        (stating the church is east, not west, of the school).

        or the same. The model explicitly states that "the church is east of the school"
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the geographical relationship between the
        two locations. This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability
        to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was because Greenpoint
        Reformed Church is explicitly stated to be east of Manhattan Country School,
        indicating a difference in location. The model specifically states "Greenpoint
        (in Brooklyn) is east of Manhattan."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        never discussed equal values - it simply stated it couldn't determine the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a reliable
        YES or NO answer" and "cannot answer this question with a definitive YES or

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO answer was given
        because one location was explicitly stated to be EAST of the other when the
        question asked about WEST. The model found a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 8 and again as a final standalone answer. The model makes a
        clear directional comparison (east vs west) and provides a definitive NO answer
        based on that comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying Central Park Precinct is EAST of Independence Towers (not
        west), indicating different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct answer based
        on its geographical reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that one location is east of the
        other, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a directional reasoning that one location is east of the other, not
        west.'

    33ed6eed-10da-45bc-8e24-33c3049ae615:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (one east, one west), not because they
        are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, based on its directional analysis concluding one
        location is east of the other rather than west.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    35f6541a-1027-4759-abd0-77a55a9ffe84:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the locations being
        in different relative positions (east vs west), not because they are equal/same.
        The model explicitly states that one location is east of the other, indicating
        a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative directional question, providing a direct response
        based on its geographic reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is east of the other, not because the locations are equal/same/identical.
        It explicitly states "Linden Houses Building 2 is located EAST of Passages
        Academy Belmont" as the reason for its NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, providing a definitive comparative answer based
        on directional analysis (east vs west)
      final_answer: 'NO'

    60edecce-c1ad-477e-8a08-b911b785eb50:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't determine
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a reliable
        YES or NO answer to this question" and indicates it lacks the necessary information
        to make the determination. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    68f457ed-0e68-4d5c-bf13-f31eafb08486:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

    9d869927-db1e-46dc-bae9-4642101e6092:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating one location is east while the other is west), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (east vs west) for
        this conclusion.

    b34b9d2c-595d-43bc-9f82-50d6e768f265:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Linden Houses was stated to be east of Passages Academy Belmont, indicating
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Linden Houses
        is east (not west) of Passages Academy Belmont.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    c0c9b10f-ec88-4417-bcd2-cfb6187d2775:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never suggested the locations were equal - it actually noted they were
        in different boroughs.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and while it "leans towards NO," it immediately qualifies
        this by saying it "cannot be 100% certain." This indicates uncertainty rather
        than a definitive answer, making this an UNKNOWN response.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Manhattan and
        Brooklyn are in "different geographical areas" and provides directional reasoning
        (Manhattan being west of Brooklyn) as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model concluded that the basketball court would be east (not west) of
        the school, indicating a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to the comparative question, providing a clear directional assessment
        based on the relative positions of Manhattan and Brooklyn.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that one location is east of the other, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was given because the relationship was opposite to what was
        being asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis
        of the relative positions (stating one location is east of the other, not
        west).

    9c82caf0-63c9-4333-9d1c-27faca9dab6d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is east of the other (a directional difference), not because the
        locations are at the same coordinates. The model explicitly states "Oakwood
        Beach Wastewater Treatment Plant is actually east of High Rock Park Building
        A."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" after determining that one location is east of the other rather
        than west.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The NO was given because the model
        determined the Wastewater Treatment Plant is east of High Rock Park Building
        A, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that the Wastewater Treatment Plant is east
        (not west) of High Rock Park Building A.

    cdbbea69-2d6b-46e9-adab-57c3a5632b57:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        one location was explicitly stated to be east of the other, indicating a difference
        in position. The model states "Oakwood Beach Wastewater Treatment Plant is
        east of High Rock Park Building A" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 6 and again as a final standalone answer. The model makes a
        clear directional comparison (east vs west) and provides a definitive NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e536eab0-8f6c-467e-986c-e322aa3f516d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that the treatment
        plant is EAST of High Rock Park Building A, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 5 and again as a final standalone answer. The model makes a
        clear comparative determination that one location is east of the other, not
        west.

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer due to insufficient location information" and indicates it
        cannot determine the relative positions because it lacks coordinates for one
        location. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification as the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it concludes NO because it determines Hunters Point
        is east of Manhattan (and thus east of the Red Balloon Learning Center), indicating
        a directional difference. The NO is based on a difference in position, not
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explains that Hunters Point South Park is east of
        Manhattan, not west. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not
        equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional reasoning
        (Queens being east of Manhattan) rather than the locations being equal/identical.
        It explicitly states a difference in position ("Queens is east of Manhattan")
        as the basis for its conclusion.

        (Queens being east of Manhattan), not because the locations are equal. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, making a definitive comparative judgment based

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (one location being east while the other is west), not because the locations
        are equal or the same. The model explicitly states that one location is east
        of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the model cannot confirm the west/east relationship due to lack of precise
        coordinates. The reason for NO is inability to verify, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined that Brooklyn is southwest of the Bronx, meaning the
        first location could not be west of the second location. The model explicitly
        describes a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical reasoning about
        the relative positions of Brooklyn and the Bronx.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations
        are in different boroughs and that Brooklyn is "generally located southwest
        of the Bronx," indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based
        on Brooklyn's location relative to the Bronx, not on equality of positions.

        the locations at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot verify" or determine the
        spatial relationship, but provides "NO" as its answer. Since the model explicitly

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same as the reason for its NO answer. While it mentions they may be
        "very close" or "part of the same site," it gives uncertainty about location
        data as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of position. The NO appears
        to be a tentative guess due to lack of data rather than based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model expresses uncertainty and states it
        "cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer," it ultimately does provide
        an explicit final "NO" answer, even while acknowledging this is a guess. Since
        we're instructed to analyze what was explicitly stated rather than resolve
        contradictions, and the model ended with a clear "NO", this should be classified
        as NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and explains that it lacks sufficient information to make the

        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot determine the
        answer but provides "NO" only because it was required to give a YES/NO response.
        The model clearly indicates this NO is "not a confident assertion" and that
        it doesn't have enough information to be certain. This makes it a case where
        the model indicates it cannot make the comparison, which should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot responsibly
        give a YES or NO answer" and asks for more information. This is a clear refusal
        to make the comparison.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    a66232ad-4973-4520-8091-23e8ad3eec45:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO is given due to lack of sufficient
        information to verify the westward relationship ("I do not have enough certainty
        to say YES"). The model never states the locations are at the same coordinates
        or equivalent positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        though it expresses uncertainty and indicates this is a forced choice. Since
        it provides a clear NO as its final comparative answer, even with the uncertainty
        expressed, this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

        make the determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and "cannot definitively say whether one is west of the
        other." This indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        locations are in different boroughs. The model never states or implies the
        locations are at the same coordinates or equally west/east of each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty and reluctance. While the model indicates
        it "cannot responsibly choose," it does ultimately provide NO as its forced
        choice answer.

        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Pink Houses is "east of the
        church's location". The NO answer is given because of this directional difference,
        not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it needs more precise location information.
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient data.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the relative positions
        being different (Brooklyn being southeast of the Bronx), not because the locations
        are the same. The model explicitly states that one location is not west of
        the other, indicating a difference in position rather than equality.

        reason for the NO answer, stating that "Pink Houses is east of the Bronx"
        and therefore "NOT west of the Blessed Sacrament Church". The NO was based
        on a directional difference, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

        they are in different locations with Astoria Houses Building 1 being east
        of Wagner Pool. The NO is based on the opposite directional relationship being
        true (east instead of west), not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical analysis

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that they are in different
        locations (different boroughs) and that one is east of the other. The NO is
        given because the direction stated in the comparison is wrong (west), not
        because the locations are identical.

        - once in step 7 and again as a final standalone answer. The model makes a
        clear directional comparison stating the church is east (not west) of the
        EMS HQ.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Bushwick
        United Methodist Church is located west of EMS Division 3 HQ in Brooklyn."
        This is a clear, direct YES answer to the comparative question.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        discussion of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and "I DO NOT KNOW." This is a clear refusal
        to make the comparison due to lack of data.

        positions (Bronx being east of Queens), not because the locations are the
        same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference, with
        the Bronx being "east of Queens."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating that the church
        is NOT west of the school). The answer is definitive and not qualified with
        uncertainty.

        a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations at
        all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains it lacks the necessary geographical information
        to make the determination. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies this
        is because one location doesn't exist in Brooklyn, making the comparison impossible.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and rejects the premise of the question because one location

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Hotel Utica being east of Kirby Center), not because the locations are equal.
        The model explicitly states that one location is east of the other, indicating
        a difference in position.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and explains that the question cannot be answered due to incorrect

      explanation_final_answer: While the model does say "NO", it immediately explains
        this is because one location is incorrectly premised (Hotel Utica is not in
        Brooklyn), making the comparison impossible. This rejection of the premise's
        validity means the answer should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

        was incorrectly placed.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at the end, it explicitly
        rejects the premises of the question by stating "Hotel Utica is actually in
        Utica, NY (upstate), NOT in Brooklyn" and uses this as the basis for saying

        data to make the determination. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer" and explains that it lacks sufficient information to make
        the determination. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the locations being
        in different positions (one east of the other), not because they are equal/same/identical.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that Macon Library is east, not west, of Kingsboro
        CC Physical Education.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know" and explains
        it cannot determine the answer with certainty. This is a clear refusal to
        make the comparison.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't verify their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but clarifies that
        this NO is due to inability to verify/confirm the comparison ("I cannot confirm
        the YES"). This makes it a case of being unable to determine rather than a
        comparative result, so it should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and "cannot answer YES or NO with confidence" due to insufficient
        location data. This indicates it cannot make the comparison rather than refusing
        to answer or giving a clear YES/NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference (Cedar Grove Cemetery is "slightly northeast of
        Pumpkin Patch Marsh") and bases its NO answer on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Cedar Grove Cemetery is
        northeast, not west, of Pumpkin Patch Marsh.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ce8c1e8b-7b82-41be-ba76-1c9a91b78875:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot determine the relative positions
        due to uncertainty about precise locations. This is a clear case where the
        model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" because it cannot verify the locations. This indicates an
        inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal or definitive answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False. The model did not give a NO answer based on
        equal values - it actually couldn't make the comparison at all due to being
        unable to verify one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and concludes with "CANNOT DETERMINE". This indicates
        the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information about
        one of the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found
        different values for the coordinates and noted a clear directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the coordinates and determining that Cedar Grove Cemetery is west of Pumpkin
        Patch Marsh.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it determines
        Pumpkin Patch Marsh is east of Cedar Grove Cemetery, indicating a directional
        difference. It does not state the locations are equal or the same - in fact,
        it explicitly states there is a directional difference. The NO is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" and provides this as a clear comparative result based on relative
        positions. The NO is not a refusal to answer or inability to determine.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it explicitly states that the Bronx is
        east of Brooklyn, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was based on the model's
        reasoning that the Bronx is northeast of Brooklyn, meaning one location cannot
        be west of the other. The model indicates a clear directional difference (not
        equality) between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:
        NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographic analysis that a location
        in the Bronx cannot be west of a location in Brooklyn.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are different,
        with "The Bronx location is further east" and "The Brooklyn location is further
        west". The NO is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result to whether Bronx River Houses Building
        8 is west of Ghana Wesley United Methodist Church. The answer is explicit
        and definitive.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it explicitly states that Bronx River
        Houses Building 8 is "actually located east of the church." This indicates
        a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result that Bronx River Houses Building 8 is
