      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and reinforced
        this with a clear final answer section stating "Answer: YES". The model provided
        reasoning about building numbering increasing west to east and definitively

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        both in the one-word response after the thinking section and in the final
        summary paragraph where it confirmed Building 6 is west of Building 7.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the buildings are at
        the same location or equal distance. Instead, it explicitly states that Building
        6 is east of Building 7, indicating a directional difference between their
        positions. The NO answer is based on Building 6 being east, not on the buildings
        being in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a definitive comparative statement that Building 6 is east of
        Building 7, not west of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    53ac2374-85cd-4715-8716-b7c954b1c713:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
        The model never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate
        whether equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response was cut off before reaching a
        final conclusion. While it explored various possibilities and seemed to lean
        towards YES at points, it never definitively settled on a final answer. The
        response shows extensive reasoning but ends mid-thought without providing
        a clear YES/NO determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        actually provides a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers various possibilities
        and approaches, it ends with uncertainty about whether building numbers increase
        east to west or vice versa, without making a final determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    d3a0301f-8720-4382-9dd7-ed23e89f7c5e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the buildings are in
        the same location or have equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Building 7 is "further west" than Building 6, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on Building 6 being east of Building 7, not because
        they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion that Building 6 is east of Building
        7, not west.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d891d3ba-5ab4-49a3-947b-3533f23cfbc3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not arrive at a clear final answer.
        While it works through various scenarios and reasoning, it ends up contradicting
        itself multiple times and never makes a definitive YES/NO statement. The response
        ends mid-thought about address numbering without reaching a conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Elton Playground is northeast of the Aviation Unit, indicating a clear
        directional difference. The NO answer was given because Elton Playground is
        east (not west) of the Aviation Unit.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that Elton Playground
        is not west of the NYPD Aviation Unit. The model provides specific reasoning
        about relative positions and arrives at this conclusion with confidence.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    248eb68a-829b-43ae-8d62-fab1b6b1fafd:

      explanation_equal_values: "While the model compares specific longitude values\
        \ (-73.88\xB0W vs -73.89\xB0W), it explicitly states there is a difference\
        \ between them and uses this difference to conclude that one location is east\
        \ of the other. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not\
        \ on the values being equal."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation confirming that Elton Playground
        is east (not west) of the NYPD Aviation Unit based on their respective longitudes.

    7642733a-d5cc-4548-98d0-0c1b7b85ec4f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal or
        the same - instead, it explicitly states that Elton Playground is east of
        the NYPD Aviation Unit, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final bolded answer, and provides a specific directional
        explanation for why one location is east of the other (not west).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    819cc331-ed0b-4678-a996-b8261a07031b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly shows different longitude values (-73.8825
        vs -73.8917) and states that the Aviation Unit is west of Elton Playground.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Elton Playground is
        east of the NYPD Aviation Unit" as its final answer after comparing the longitudes.
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    96d6d694-c493-464d-9d92-f89cb33f62d6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference - that Elton Playground is east of the NYPD
        Aviation Unit, lying "significantly to the northeast of Floyd Bennett Field."
        The NO answer was given because of this directional difference, not because
        of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation that Elton Playground is east, not
        west, of the NYPD Aviation Unit. This is a direct comparative answer to the
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    98ad6404-6c0f-4776-ab4e-56ecb0c78223:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Elton Playground lies EAST of the NYPD Aviation Unit, indicating a clear
        directional difference between the two locations. The NO answer was given
        because they have different positions, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is specifically addressing the comparative directional
        relationship (whether Elton Playground is west of the NYPD Aviation Unit).
        The model is confident in this answer and provides specific reasoning for
        it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a2da1003-dd71-431f-8625-e2303f6babf2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different longitude values
        (-73.8733 vs -73.8900) and explicitly states that Elton Playground is east
        of the NYPD Aviation Unit based on these different values. While the difference
        is small, any difference means the values are not equal, and the NO answer
        is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Elton Playground is east of the NYPD Aviation
        Unit, not west. The answer is definitive and directional.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Elton Playground is east of the NYPD Aviation Unit, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer was given because of this
        directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a definitive comparative answer that Elton Playground
        is not west of the NYPD Aviation Unit (because it''s east of it).'

    ce15cca3-0eb2-483f-8bcc-951d494500e5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Elton
        Playground is east of the NYPD Aviation Unit (specifically northeast), not
        because the locations are at the same longitude. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Elton Playground is east of the NYPD
        Aviation Unit, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: "While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not\
        \ because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference\
        \ in longitude values (-73.8733\xB0 vs -73.8880\xB0) and uses this difference\
        \ to conclude that Elton Playground is east of, not west of, the Aviation\

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on longitude values
        showing that Elton Playground is east of (not west of) the NYPD Aviation Unit.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model did discuss equal and
        similar coordinates at points, but never reached a NO conclusion based on
        equality or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but ends abruptly
        without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion. While there are some intermediate
        YES statements during the reasoning process ("Hence, the answer would be YES"),
        the model ultimately gets confused about coordinates and directions, and doesn't
        provide a final definitive answer before cutting off.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Even if we were to
        consider the incomplete reasoning, while the model does compare longitude
        values, it never reaches a final NO conclusion based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete, ending mid-sentence
        with "Pratt Playground is". While the model works through various reasoning
        steps and seems to be heading towards a NO answer based on longitude comparisons,
        it never actually states a final YES/NO conclusion. Without an explicit final
        answer, we must classify this as UNKNOWN.

        didn't make any equality comparison between the locations anyway.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and cuts off
        mid-analysis without providing a final YES/NO answer. The model was working
        through the locations but never reached a conclusion about whether one was
        west of the other.

    fa0c1897-77a3-4388-bd46-36ac88ae6e66:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the longitudes are very close
        (-73.9644 vs -73.9648), it explicitly states there is a difference, with the
        synagogue being "a tiny bit west" and Pratt Playground being "slightly east".
        The NO answer is based on this small but definite difference, not on the values
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer, specifically concluding that Pratt Playground is
        not west of the synagogue. The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference - that the garage is east of the guard shack,
        not west. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a definitive comparative statement that "The Fort Wadsworth Garage
        is located east of the guard shack." This is a clear NO answer to whether
        the garage is west of the guard shack.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        locations (West Side vs East Side) and gives their different addresses. The
        NO answer is based on Straus Houses being east of FDNY Rescue, not on them
        being in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including a final bolded "**Answer: NO**", and provides a clear comparative
        reasoning for why one location is east of the other rather than west.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with one being on the east side near FDR Drive and the other being
        in Midtown West. The NO is because the first location is east of the second,
        not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        comparative answer, providing specific geographical reasoning for why the
        Straus Houses Community Center is not west of FDNY Rescue Collapse 1, but
        rather east of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it does not
        state that the locations are equal or identical. Instead, it explicitly describes
        them as being at different positions, with one location being east of 5th
        Avenue and the other being west of 5th Avenue. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion about the relative
        positions of the two locations. The answer is supported with specific geographical
        reasoning about east/west positions in Manhattan.

        - one on the "far east side near the East River" and the other on the "west
        side near the Hudson River". The NO answer is given because Straus Houses
        is east of (not west of) FDNY Rescue Collapse 1.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both after its thinking process and in the final summary. The
        NO is given as a direct comparative result based on the relative east-west
        positions of the two locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations
        are different, with one being on the east side (First Avenue) and the other
        on the west side (10th/11th Avenue). The NO is given because the Community
        Center is east of the FDNY site, not west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a definitive comparative result about the relative
        positions of the two locations. The answer is supported by detailed reasoning
        about east-west positioning in Manhattan.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that the locations are different, with the
        community center being "significantly farther east" than the FDNY location.
        The model describes the FDNY location as being between 10th-11th Avenues while
        the community center is east of 1st Avenue.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative explanation that the community center is
        east of the FDNY location, not west.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that one location is on
        the "far eastern edge" while the other is on the "western side" of Manhattan,
        indicating a clear difference in position. The NO is because one location
        is east of the other, not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation of why the community center is east
        (not west) of the FDNY location.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that the Straus Houses
        are "significantly further east" than the FDNY site and provides specific
        different longitude values (-73.94 vs -74.00). The NO is because one location
        is east of the other, not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly concludes
        that the Straus Houses Community Center is not west of the FDNY rescue site,
        providing a definitive comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that Bushman Steps
        is on the east side near the Harlem River while UPACA is on the west side
        of Manhattan, indicating a clear difference in position. The NO is because
        Bushman Steps is east of (not equal to) UPACA.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative explanation for why Bushman Steps is not west of UPACA Senior
        Center, explaining that Bushman Steps is on the east side while UPACA is on
        the west side.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that one location is east of the other, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO answer was given because the first location
        is east of the second, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion about the relative

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different longitude values (-73.9125
        vs -73.9436) and concludes NO because the post office is east of the school,
        not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that the post office is east
        of the school, not west of it. The answer is explicitly stated and based on

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that the post office
        is east of the school, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        two locations. The NO answer was based on the post office being east (different
        location), not because the locations were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that the post office is east of the school, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        actually provides a clear YES/NO conclusion. While it considers various possibilities
        and seems to lean towards "yes" in some parts ("Therefore, the post office
        is west of the school"), it ends mid-thought with "Alternatively, if the school
        is in East New York..." without making a final determination. The response
        shows uncertainty about the school's actual location and ends without committing
        to an answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Jamaica Bay
        is southeast of CCB School Flushing, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Jamaica
        Bay National Wildlife Refuge is not west of CCB School Flushing" as its final
        answer, providing a direct comparative result.

        being equal/same - instead, it explicitly states that AVSP is north/northeast
        of Last Chance Pond Park, indicating a directional difference between the
        locations. The NO is based on AVSP being in a different direction (north)
        rather than west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative directional reasoning, explaining that AVSP
        is north/northeast of Last Chance Pond Park, not west.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that A VERY SPECIAL PLACE is east
        of LAST CHANCE POND PARK, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference (being east rather than west), not
        on the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its reasoning
        about the relative locations of the two places. The answer is stated multiple
        times and is presented as a definitive conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states they are in different
        positions, with A VERY SPECIAL PLACE being east of LAST CHANCE POND PARK.
        The model describes LAST CHANCE POND PARK as being on the western side and
        A VERY SPECIAL PLACE as being in the central-eastern area.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with a bolded "NO" after
        explaining its reasoning about the relative positions of the two locations.
        This is a direct comparative answer to whether A VERY SPECIAL PLACE is west
        of LAST CHANCE POND PARK.

        based on this directional difference (being southeast rather than west), not
        on the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is specifically addressing the comparative directional
        relationship (whether A is west of B). The model provides detailed reasoning
        leading to this conclusion.

        locations, with one being in the East Village (Avenue A) and the other in
        Midtown (around 5th or 8th Ave). The NO answer is based on the learning center
        being east of the mikvah, not on them being in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times, including
        as its final answer, and provides a directional explanation for why one location
        is east of the other rather than west. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
        The model never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-thought without providing a
        clear YES/NO conclusion. While it explores various possibilities and calculations,
        it never reaches a definitive answer about whether La Quinta is west of Butterfly
        Gardens. The analysis actually suggests it depends on which Butterfly Gardens
        location is being referenced, but no final determination is made.

        never reached a final conclusion about equality or inequality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-sentence and
        never reaches a clear final conclusion. While it discusses various possibilities
        and seems to be leaning towards "NO" at one point, it continues analyzing
        different interpretations of the address and ends without making a definitive

        - specifically that the first location is on 8th Avenue which is east of the
        synagogue's location between 11th and 12th Avenues. The model does not state
        the locations are equal or the same; rather, it explicitly states there is

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were at the same position. Instead, the model explicitly determined
        that one location was east of the other (8th Ave being east of 10th Ave where
        the synagogue is located), indicating a difference in position rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-sentence, but
        in the last complete paragraph, the model clearly states "Hence, the answer
        is NO" after determining that the location would be east (not west) of the
        synagogue based on avenue numbers (8th Ave being east of 10th Ave).

        of any comparisons made in the analysis.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-thought without providing a
        clear YES/NO conclusion. While the model discovers that the longitude comparison
        (-73.9776 vs -73.9704) suggests the first location is west of the second,
        it never states a final answer before cutting off.

        it explicitly states that the locations are different, with the synagogue
        being "further west" and the Transverse Road being "east of the synagogue".
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we considered the partial "NO" mentioned for one scenario, it wasn't based
        on equal values but rather on relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence without providing a
        clear YES/NO conclusion. While the model explores various possibilities and
        mentions "therefore, the answer would be NO" when considering one possibility
        (if the address is in Central Park), this is just one of many scenarios considered,
        and the response doesn't settle on a final answer before cutting off.

        synagogue is between 10th/11th Avenues, making the first location east of
        the synagogue. The model does not state the locations are equal or the same;
        rather, it identifies a specific directional difference as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        did discuss various scenarios where locations might be east or west of each
        other but never reached a final conclusion about equality or inequality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive analysis but never reaches
        a clear final YES/NO conclusion. The model goes back and forth considering
        different possibilities about the locations but ends mid-thought while still
        analyzing possibilities about park drives. There is no definitive comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations
        are different, with Fermi Playground being southeast of River Ave Overpass.
        The NO is based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Fermi Playground is not
        west of River Ave Overpass, explaining it is actually southeast of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but explicitly states
        there is a difference in longitude values (73.9264W vs 73.8994W), indicating
        the locations are not at the same coordinates. The NO is because one location
        is east of the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, supported by detailed geographical reasoning about
        the relative positions of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Fermi
        Playground is east of River Ave Overpass, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO is based on one location being east of the
        other, not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation of why one location is not west of
        the other. The answer is a direct comparative result, not a refusal or inability
        to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear explanation supporting this answer, stating "Therefore, the answer
        should be YES" followed by a final "YES" with detailed explanation of the
        longitude comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a directional difference, saying Brooklyn is "east of the western Bronx"
        and "geographically southeast of the Bronx." The NO answer was based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that Fermi Playground
        is not west of River Ave location. The answer is definitive and comparative,
        not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-thought with "Wait, that" and
        never provides a final explicit YES/NO answer. While the model seems to be
        leaning towards YES in its last complete thought ("Therefore, the answer would
        be YES"), it then starts to question this conclusion ("Wait, that") before

        The NO answer is based on Brooklyn being east of Manhattan, not on the locations
        being at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative directional conclusion that the Brooklyn location is east, not
        west, of the Manhattan location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Brooklyn is east of Manhattan, and therefore the Senior Club (in Brooklyn)
        must be east of the Conservatory (in Manhattan). The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that since the Senior Club is in Brooklyn (east) and the Conservatory is in
        Manhattan (west), the Senior Club cannot be west of the Conservatory. This
        is a direct comparative answer.

        locations have equal coordinates. The model explicitly shows different longitude
        values (-73.9215 vs -73.9475) and states that Rafferty Triangle is east of
        Harlem Library. The NO is because Rafferty Triangle is east, not west, of
        Harlem Library.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by detailed coordinate analysis showing Rafferty Triangle
        is east of Harlem Library. This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal
        or inability to determine.

        Rafferty Triangle is east of Harlem Library, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a directional

        are equal - it explicitly states that Rafferty Triangle is east of Harlem
        Library, comparing different longitude values (-73.9213 vs -73.9457) and explaining
        that Queens locations are east of Manhattan. The NO is due to a directional

        never reached a definitive NO conclusion based on equal values or any other
        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO conclusion. While it considers various possible
        locations and relationships, it ends with "But wait, maybe The Andrews Homeless
        Shelter is located further west..." and an unfinished thought about avenue

      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly without providing a final
        YES/NO conclusion. While the model does extensive analysis of possible locations

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        specifically stating that the church is "northeast of Rangel" and "east of
        Rangel." The NO is because one location is east of the other, not because
        they are at the same location or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" as its comparative answer,
        stating "Therefore, the church would be northeast of Rangel. So, being east
        of Rangel, it's not west. Therefore, the answer is NO." Although it then adds
        some uncertainty ("But wait, perhaps..."), the last definitive comparative

        it east, or on 8th Ave which would make it west), it ends mid-thought without
        making a final determination. The response shows uncertainty about the exact
        locations and ends without providing a clear YES/NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, it explicitly stated that the church
        is "significantly east" of 5th Avenue while Rangel Houses is west of it, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        provides a clear comparative conclusion that the church is east of Rangel
        Houses, not west. The answer is definitive and directional.

        the incomplete response was comparing different locations rather than stating
        they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and cuts off
        mid-analysis without providing a final YES/NO conclusion. While the model
        was working through the geographical relationships, it never reached a definitive
        answer about whether one location is west of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer, so the question of whether it gave a
        NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        actually provides a clear YES/NO answer. It ends with multiple "alternatively"
        scenarios and seems uncertain, considering both YES and NO as possibilities
        without settling on either one. The last statement is cut off mid-sentence,
        and no final conclusion is reached.

        The model never actually gave a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate if equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response appears to be incomplete and
        ends mid-thought. Throughout the lengthy analysis, the model explores various
        possibilities and scenarios but never arrives at a definitive YES/NO answer.
        The response consists entirely of hypotheticals ("if", "maybe", "perhaps")

        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference - the academy is south of the church. The NO answer is based on
        the academy being in a different direction (south) rather than west, not on
        the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion that the academy is south, not
        west, of the church.

        various possible relative positions when the response ended.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-sentence

      explanation_final_answer: After extensive deliberation, the model concludes
        with "So I think the answer is YES" and begins to list supporting points about
        Sutphin Blvd being west of Merrick. Though the response was cut off, the final
        explicit answer given was YES.

        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it didn't even reach a
        final answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence)
        and never reaches a final YES/NO conclusion. While it explores various hypothetical
        scenarios and locations, considering both possibilities where the academy
        could be west or east of the church, it doesn't make a definitive comparative

        was actually comparing different values (-73.95 vs -73.935) rather than equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence with "Because" and
        never explicitly states a final YES/NO answer. While the model seems to be

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (Queensbridge Park is east of Carver
        Houses), not because they are equal/same. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

        the locations are equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Queensbridge
        Park is east of Carver Houses, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO is based on one location being east of the other,
        not on them being at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion about the relative

        because the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference - that Queensbridge Park is east
        of Carver Houses, not west. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

        is east of Carver Houses, indicating a clear directional difference. While
        it mentions their longitudes might be "similar," it ultimately concludes that
        Queens is definitively east of Manhattan, making the locations different,
        not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        longitude or are at the same east-west position. Instead, it explicitly states
        that Queensbridge Park is east of Carver Houses, indicating a difference in
        position. The NO answer is based on the fact that one location is east of
        the other, not that they are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a definitive comparative answer based on geographical reasoning about the
        east-west positioning of Queens relative to Manhattan. The answer is explicitly
        stated and justified.

        \ farther\" east than PS 146, indicating a difference in values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Cooper Park Houses Building 11 is not west of
        PS 146 Ann M Short. The model provides specific reasoning and coordinates
        to support this conclusion.

    7bff3fe6-7e61-4294-a5fc-3d7c4e85f5b4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that Brooklyn lies
        east of Manhattan and therefore the Brooklyn location cannot be west of the
        Manhattan location. The model describes a clear directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative directional reasoning for why Cooper Park Houses Building 11 cannot
        be west of PS 146, based on the relative positions of Brooklyn and Manhattan.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        \ this difference to conclude that Cooper Park is east of PS 146. The NO answer\
        \ is based on one location being east of the other, not on them being equal."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific longitude coordinates to support its comparative
        conclusion that Cooper Park is east of (not west of) PS 146.

    e4cf4bfb-bb60-4970-8134-2c02a911027e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical
        - instead it explicitly states that Cooper Park is east of Manhattan and therefore
        east of the school. The NO answer is based on a directional difference (east
        vs west), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a definitive comparative directional conclusion that Cooper Park
        is east, not west, of the Manhattan school.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the rules. Even if we were to interpret
        the incomplete "not west of PS" as a NO answer, the model discusses different
        coordinates and positions throughout, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence with "Cooper Park is
        not west of PS" which strongly implies a NO answer, but doesn't explicitly
        state it. The model walks through various coordinates and geographical reasoning
        but never gives a clear, explicit YES/NO conclusion. Therefore, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equality or inequality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-analysis without providing a
        final YES/NO conclusion. The model was working through the geographical locations
        and relative positions but did not reach a definitive answer before the response
        was cut off.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear explanation supporting this answer, stating that Manhattan is geographically
        west of Queens and therefore St. Nicholas Houses Building 13 must be west
        of Arch Street Yard.

        was comparing different values (-73.9470 vs -73.9495) rather than equal values
        anyway.
      explanation_final_answer: The response is incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence)
        and contains multiple contradictory statements. While it initially concludes
        "YES" at one point, it later changes to "NO", and then appears to be reconsidering
        again when it cuts off. Without a clear final conclusion, we cannot determine
        the model's ultimate answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through its reasoning but never actually
        provides a final YES/NO answer. While it states "Therefore, the answer would
        be NO" at one point in its reasoning, it then continues to search for specific
        addresses and never confirms this as its final conclusion. The response ends

        is). This directional difference is the reason for the NO answer, not equality
        of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer based on equal values - it actually explored
        various scenarios with different coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive analysis but never
        reaches a definitive conclusion. It presents multiple scenarios where the
        answer could be YES or NO depending on specific locations, and ends with "But
        this is speculative. To answer correctly, the user needs the actual addresses
        or coordinates of both locations." This indicates the model cannot make a
        determination without more specific information.

    cad09056-08fd-4e15-9348-230eca5e2fc0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations have equal/same
        values. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in longitude values (-73.9264
        vs -73.9426) and states that Libertad is east of FDNY RAC Unit 2 because its
        longitude is less negative (closer to 0)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that Libertad Urban Farm is east of FDNY RAC Unit 2 based
        on their longitudes (-73.9264 vs -73.9426)

        it explicitly states that Libertad Urban Farm (-73.896) is east of FDNY RAC
        Unit 2 (-73.936), with different longitude values. The NO answer is based
        on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Libertad Urban Farm is not
        west of FDNY RAC Unit 2, based on their specific longitudes.

        never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate if equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        never reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion. While the model works through detailed
        reasoning about the locations and seems to be building toward saying the subway
        station is west of the consulate, it never explicitly states a final comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions, with the field house being east of the
        high school. The model does not state that the locations are equal or the
        same - it specifically identifies a directional difference as the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that the field house is east of the high school, making
        a definitive comparative statement that it is not west.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes that both locations share
        "the same east-west alignment" since they're on the same north-south street,
        this isn't given as the primary reason for the NO answer. Rather, the model
        states NO because the field house is "directly north, not west" of the high
        school - indicating a different directional relationship rather than equality
        as the reason for the negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion that the field house is not west
        of the high school, but rather directly north of it.

    592c7832-af16-44eb-8f15-f351d1fef071:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines the
        field house is actually east of the school, based on analyzing street numbers
        and Queens' address system. The model specifically states "the park is east
        of the school" multiple times as its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its
        analysis, indicating that the field house is not west of the school, but rather
        east of it. The answer is clear and direct.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    70f495c5-d74c-4033-bd08-ea0b7cab3802:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that the Field House is east of the
        high school, indicating a clear directional difference between the two locations
        (173rd Street is "significantly east of 156th Street"). The NO is because
        the relationship is opposite to what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion based on its analysis that the Field
        House lies east of the high school, not west.

        locations are in different positions (one is east of the other), not because
        they are equal/same. The model explicitly states the field house is east of
        the high school, indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a definitive
        comparative directional answer, explaining that the field house is east, not
        west, of the high school. The answer is supported by specific reasoning about
        Queens street numbering.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations have equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly states that the
        Field House is east of the High School (177th Street is east of 156th Street).
        The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation concluding that the Field House
        is east of (not west of) the High School. The answer is a direct comparative
        result.

        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that one location is east
        of the other, indicating a clear directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO is based on the Field House being east rather than west of the school.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative directional assessment that the
        Field House is east, not west, of the high school.

    c2cada99-20b0-4178-add7-9342bf48085d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a specific
        directional difference - that the field house is east of the high school due
        to street numbering (173rd vs 156th). It does not state the locations are
        equal or the same, but rather explicitly states one is east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that the field house is east,
        not west, of the high school.

        vs -73.7641), it explicitly states there is a difference between them, with
        the field house being east of the high school. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation showing that the field house is
        east (not west) of the high school based on longitude comparisons.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        was still deliberating between different possible locations and their relative
        positions when the response ended.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-thought without providing a
        clear YES/NO conclusion. While the model discusses various possibilities and
        coordinates, it never reaches a definitive answer. The last statement even
        introduces uncertainty about the actual location ("However,") before cutting
        off.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that one location
        is east and south of the other, indicating a clear directional difference.
        The NO is because Glenmore Ave is east (not west) of the Gate House.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that Glenmore Ave is not
        west of the College Gate House. This is a direct comparative answer, not a
        refusal or inability to determine.

        the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Glenmore Ave lies east of the
        Gate House, indicating a clear directional difference. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly concludes
        that Glenmore Ave is not west of the Gate House, providing a directional explanation
        that Glenmore Ave lies east of the Gate House.

        - it explicitly states that Glenmore Ave is east of the College, not that
        they are at the same location. The model describes specific different locations
        and explains why one is west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in longitude values (-73.8931 vs -73.9681) and concluded that the nursery
        was east of the school, not west. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a definitive comparative result based on longitude coordinates,
        explaining that the nursery is east of the school, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly without providing a clear
        YES/NO conclusion. While the model attempts to reason through the locations
        and coordinates extensively, it never reaches a definitive answer about whether
        Van Cortlandt Park is west of PS 7. The response appears incomplete, cutting
        off mid-analysis.

        is a difference in their east-west positions, with Stuyvesant Town being east
        of Kips Bay Towers (First Avenue vs Second/Third Avenues). The NO is because
        one location is east of the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        ("Therefore, the answer would be NO"), it then immediately questions its own
        understanding ("But wait, maybe I'm getting the avenues wrong") and ends without

        we considered the "NO" mentioned during reasoning, it was based on directional
        differences (east vs west) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-thought without providing a
        clear YES/NO conclusion. While there is discussion of relative positions and
        a "NO" appears in the reasoning process, it's part of the thinking rather
        than a final answer. The response trails off discussing positions on First
        Avenue without reaching a definitive conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we considered the tentative "NO" mentioned in the text, it wasn't because
        the locations were equal - the model actually suggested they were different
        (with Stuyvesant Town being east of Kips Bay).
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        doesn't reach a clear final conclusion. While the model seems to be working
        towards a "NO" answer at one point ("Therefore, the answer would be NO"),
        it then immediately questions its own reasoning ("Wait, but maybe I messed
        up the avenue order") and continues thinking without reaching a definitive
        conclusion before the response ends.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any equality comparisons that might have been made in the incomplete analysis.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-analysis
        without providing a final YES/NO conclusion about whether Stuyvesant Town
        is west of Kips Bay Towers South Building. The model was still working through
        address calculations when the response ended.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equality or inequality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows an extensive thought process trying
        to determine the locations of both buildings, but never reaches a conclusion
        or provides a YES/NO answer. The model gets caught up in analyzing the Manhattan
        address system and street layout without completing the comparison between
        the two locations.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal/same - it explicitly stated that Stuyvesant Town is east of Kips Bay
        Towers South, indicating a directional difference. The NO was based on the
        fact that one location was east of the other, not that they were at the same
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        a clear comparative directional reasoning, stating that Stuyvesant Town is
        east of Kips Bay Towers South, not west.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a clear final YES/NO conclusion. While it suggests "NO, it's not west" at
        one point, it immediately doubles back with "Wait, but maybe..." and continues
        questioning its assumptions. The response ends mid-sentence without providing
        a definitive answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same east-west position as the primary reason for its NO answer. While
        it mentions they are both "on Manhattan's eastern edge," it gives a different
        reason for the NO answer - specifically that Skyport Marina is north of the
        pier, not west. The model discusses their relative positions extensively and
        concludes the relationship is north-south rather than west-east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Skyport Marina is not west of Pier 69-E, explaining
        that it is north instead.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we were to consider
        the incomplete reasoning, while the text discusses both locations potentially
        being "along the same eastern edge," it never reaches a final conclusion based
        on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-sentence and
        never reaches a clear final conclusion. While it explores various possibilities
        and seems to be leaning towards "NO" in some parts, it doesn't explicitly
        state a final YES/NO answer before being cut off. Without a clear final answer,
        this must be classified as UNKNOWN.

        never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate if equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly without providing a clear
        YES/NO conclusion. While the model does extensive analysis comparing coordinates
        and locations, it keeps second-guessing itself and doesn't reach a definitive
        answer about whether Holy Cross Church is west of Bais Esther School.

        the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-thought
        without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion. While the model does extensive
        analysis of coordinates and directions, it never reaches a final comparative
        answer about whether Holy Cross Church is west of Bais Esther School. The

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we considered the tentative NO mentioned in the middle of the response, it
        wasn't because the values were equal - it was because one longitude was slightly
        different than the other (-73.9917 vs -73.9964).
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        doesn't reach a clear final YES/NO conclusion. While the model does extensive
        analysis comparing longitudes and seems to lean towards NO at one point, it
        then questions its own reasoning ("But wait, that seems counterintuitive")
        and continues analyzing without providing a definitive answer before being

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations have equal coordinates. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that the playground is east of the Learning Center, indicating a directional
        difference. The model discusses various coordinates and concludes that Queens
        (where the playground is) must be east of Manhattan (where the Learning Center
        is) due to their positions relative to the East River.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation confirming that the playground cannot
        be west of the Learning Center because Queens is east of Manhattan.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions, with one being
        east and one being west of each other. The NO answer is based on the playground
        being east of the learning center, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative directional reasoning - that the playground is east of the learning
        center, not west.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the locations are equal/same/identical. Rather, it states that one
        location is east of the other (indicating a difference in position). The NO
        is based on Queens being east of Manhattan, not because the locations are
        at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a comparative directional
        reasoning for why one location is not west of the other.

    7f8cb483-cec3-4cfe-b5dd-ed2e33aa47ff:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        - that Queens is east of Manhattan and therefore the playground must be east
        (not west) of the learning center. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a definitive comparative result based on the geographical
        relationship between Queens and Manhattan.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with Manhattan being west of Queens and therefore the Red Balloon Learning
        Center being west of Hunters Point S Park. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning about the geographical positions, concluding that since Manhattan
        lies west of Queens, Hunters Point S Park cannot be west of the Red Balloon
        Learning Center.

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        never explicitly states a final YES/NO answer. While the text repeatedly suggests
        "No" throughout the reasoning process, it ends without making a definitive
        conclusion. Therefore, we must classify this as UNKNOWN since no clear final

      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive analysis but never
        reaches a definitive YES/NO conclusion. It states "the answer depends on where
        exactly the church is in Brooklyn" and ends with an incomplete thought about
        coordinates. The model demonstrates uncertainty about the church's location
        and therefore cannot make a definitive comparison.

        values (-73.91 vs -73.87) and explicitly states that the Bronx location is
        west of the Brooklyn location. The NO is not due to equal values, but rather
        because it found the opposite directional relationship than what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model spends considerable time analyzing
        coordinates, it ultimately determines that Dyker Beach Park is "very slightly
        east" of Stuyvesant High School (specifically, -74.0154 vs -74.0163). The
        NO answer is based on this small difference in coordinates, not on the values

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        longitude values (-73.88 vs -74.01) and explicitly stating that one location
        is east of the other. The NO is not due to the values being equal, but rather
        because one location is explicitly east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific longitude values (-73.955
        vs -73.920), it does not state these values are equal. In fact, it explicitly
        notes they are different, with one being east of the other. The NO answer
        is based on NYCCC being east of PS 75, not because the locations have equal
        coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a definitive comparative answer based on its longitude

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly calculates different longitude values (-73.94 vs -73.96)
        and uses this difference to determine that PS 75 is west of NYCCC. The NO
        answer is given because NYCCC is east of PS 75, not because the locations
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both after the thinking section and in the formal answer section.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result (NO, the NYCCC is not west
        of PS 75).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions, with NYCCC being east of PS 75. The
        model never states or implies the locations are at the same position - rather,
        it explicitly states they are in different neighborhoods with different relative
        positions. The NO is because one is east of the other, not because they're
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a directional explanation - that NYCCC is east of PS 75, not
        west. The answer is explicitly comparative and definitive.

        and uses this difference to conclude that one location is east of the other.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on longitude
        values showing the Children's Center is east of PS 75, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes a difference in location, stating
        that one location is in eastern Brooklyn while the other is in western Brooklyn,
        with Clarkson Ave being "farther east than Hoyt St." The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by directional reasoning about the locations. The

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same/identical, but rather because it determined that the Children's
        Center is east of PS 75 (indicating a difference in position). The model explicitly
        states "the Children's Center is east of PS 75, not west" as its reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
        The model did discuss equality in some coordinates when comparing different

      explanation_final_answer: The response is very long and meandering, but never
        actually provides a clear YES/NO conclusion. While it discusses various possibilities
        and geographical facts, it ends mid-thought without making a final determination.
        The model appears to get caught up in analyzing the premise (that the school

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was because the model
        determined that Brooklyn is southeast of the Bronx, meaning the church would
        be east (not west) of the Bronx location. The model explicitly describes a
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - rather, it concludes NO because it determines the church
        is southeast of the subway yard, indicating a clear directional difference.
        The model explicitly states the church would be "southeast of the subway yard,
        meaning it's not west."
      explanation_final_answer: The model reaches a clear "NO" conclusion in its reasoning,
        stating "Therefore, Bethlehem Baptist Church would be southeast of the subway
        yard, meaning it's not west. So the answer would be NO." Although the response

        automatically receives a False classification per the instructions, regardless
        of any equality comparisons in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear comparative statement that the church is west of the subway yards,
        supported by longitude coordinates.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-sentence.
        While it seems to be leaning towards saying "yes" at one point ("Therefore,
        yes, it's west"), it then continues to discuss nuances and uncertainties,
        and never reaches a clear final conclusion. Without a definitive YES/NO statement
        at the end, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions at one point that Canarsie
        (-73.89) has "the same longitude" as the Bronx location (-73.89), this is
        not given as the reason for the NO answer. Instead, the model's final conclusion
        states the NO is because the church is southeast of the Bronx location, indicating
        a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        concludes with a clear "NO" followed by an explanation that the church is
        southeast of the Bronx location, not west.

        The model never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate if equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a definitive YES/NO conclusion. The model gets caught in circular reasoning
        about coordinates and locations, and the response actually cuts off mid-sentence
        without providing a final answer. This is a clear case where no explicit comparative
        conclusion was reached.

        The NO answer is based on Brooklyn being east of Manhattan, not on the locations
        having equal coordinates.

        The model never gave a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate if equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive analysis but never
        provides a clear YES/NO conclusion. It ends with comparing coordinates (-74.0
        vs -73.95) but doesn't state a final answer. The response shows uncertainty

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference - that the Brooklyn location is east
        of the Manhattan location. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as a standalone answer and in the final explanation. The
        model makes a clear directional comparison concluding that the Brooklyn location
        is east, not west, of the Manhattan location.

        of whether values were equal is not relevant since there was no final NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly without providing a final
        YES/NO answer. While there is extensive discussion and several tentative "yes"
        statements throughout the reasoning process, the model never reaches a definitive
        conclusion since the response cuts off while still trying to look up coordinates.

        The model discusses various possibilities including them being the same place,
        but never reaches a final NO conclusion based on equality or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence)
        and never provides a clear YES/NO answer. Throughout the response, the model
        repeatedly considers different possibilities ("maybe", "alternatively", "perhaps")
        but never commits to a final conclusion. The last complete sentence starts

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates the complex and park are
        "adjacent or overlapping," it does not state they are exactly equal or identical.
        Instead, it explains they are part of the same historic site but describes
        them as having different components (house vs. additional structures). The
        NO answer is based on there being "no clear directional separation" rather
        than the locations being exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing a clear explanation that the complex is not located west
        of the park. This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a clear final YES/NO conclusion. While it mentions "lean towards YES" and
        considers various possibilities, it ends mid-thought without making a definitive

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it's not because the
        locations are exactly equal or identical. Rather, it explains that one (the
        park) is integrated into and is a component of the other (the Complex). This
        describes a containment relationship, not equality. The model specifically
        states they are "components of the same area" rather than being the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion, explaining that the Complex and House Park are components
        of the same area rather than separate locations.

        longitude values (-74.0043 vs -74.0103) and explicitly stating that one location
        is east of the other. The values are not equal, and the NO is based on finding
        that the relationship is opposite to what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

        coordinates -73.91 vs -73.8726 and finds them different). The NO is because
        the relationship is opposite to what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a definitive comparative conclusion that "the gas station is NOT west of the

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-sentence
        without providing a clear final YES/NO answer. While there is some discussion
        suggesting "That would make the answer YES" at one point, this is immediately
        followed by a counter-scenario and the response cuts off before reaching a
        conclusion. Therefore, no definitive answer was given.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the response shows varying coordinate comparisons but never concludes they
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-thought with "But wait" and
        never provides a clear YES/NO conclusion. While it contains detailed geographic
        analysis and coordinates, it does not reach a final comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        - it explicitly states that the gas station lies "east of the school, not
        west" and describes their relative positions (gas station in southeast Queens,
        school in northwest Bronx). The model does not claim the locations are equal
        or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including a final bolded "**Answer: NO**". The model provides a definitive

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states the gas station is southeast
        of the school and the school is northwest of the gas station, indicating different
        positions. The NO is based on the gas station being east (not west) of the
        school.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a directional
        explanation that the gas station is east (not west) of the school, making
        this a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        - that the gas station is east of the school. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, concluding that the gas station is east (not west)
        of the school. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (gas station being east of the school, not west), not because the locations
        are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference with the gas station being east of the East River and the school
        being west of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a directional explanation that the gas station is east, not west,
        of the school.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because Hotel Utica is
        east of Kirby, providing specific different longitude values (-73.924 vs -73.929).
        The values are not equal, and the NO answer is based on one location being
        east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and provides

        equal/identical. The model explicitly describes different locations - Cedar
        Grove in Far Rockaway (eastern end) and Pumpkin Patch Marsh near Broad Channel
        (western part).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final conclusion, and provides a directional explanation
        for why Cedar Grove Cemetery is east (not west) of Pumpkin Patch Marsh.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f37b05e2-58b1-4390-8c1f-aa7338da30dd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it didn't even reach a
        final comparative conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (cuts off mid-thought)
        and never reaches a final YES/NO conclusion. Throughout the lengthy analysis,
        the model repeatedly considers different possibilities but remains uncertain,
        using phrases like "maybe," "alternatively," and "depending on." No definitive
        answer is provided.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    fb9c47ac-7e85-45af-9a12-0804e36505a5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this question
        is automatically False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly stated \"YES\" as its final\
        \ answer, followed by a clear explanation confirming that Cedar Grove Cemetery\
        \ is west of Pumpkin Patch Marsh based on their respective longitudes (-73.76\xB0\
        W vs -73.73\xB0W)."
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    fdf7af72-eb48-456c-a47a-ff5dc2d7eb10:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN\
        \ (not NO), this must be False according to the classification rules. Even\
        \ if we had considered the intermediate \"NO\" statements as final answers,\
        \ they were based on specific coordinate comparisons showing different values\
        \ (e.g., 73.7558\xB0W vs 73.815\xB0W), not on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model never explicitly states a final YES/NO answer.
        While it works through various possibilities and at several points says "therefore,
        the answer would be NO," it continues to question its assumptions and considers
        alternatives right until the end, never settling on a definitive answer. The
        response ends mid-thought about Bayswater Park without making a final determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in longitude values (-73.8676 vs -73.9578) and concluded that the Bronx location
        was east of the church, not west. The NO was based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative result based on longitude coordinates, stating
        that the Bronx location is east of the church, not west.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the Bronx location
        (-73.8780) is east of the Brooklyn location (-73.9141), showing a clear difference
        in longitude values. The NO is based on the Bronx location being east (opposite
        of what was asked), not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific coordinates and explaining that the Bronx
        location is east of the Brooklyn church. This is a direct comparative answer
        to the westward relationship question.

      explanation_equal_values: "The model's NO answer is based on a difference in\
        \ values (-73.8717\xB0 vs -73.9506\xB0), not on equality. The model explicitly\
        \ states that the Brooklyn church is further west than the Bronx location,\
        \ showing a clear difference in their positions. While the reasoning is detailed,\
        \ it's based on different values rather than equal ones."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on longitude coordinates. The
        answer is explicitly stated and justified with specific coordinates showing
        the Bronx location is east of the Brooklyn church.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because\
        \ the values are equal. The model explicitly states different longitude values\
        \ (73.9036\xB0W vs 73.9306\xB0W) and concludes NO because the Bronx location\
        \ is east of (not equal to) the Brooklyn location. The values are different,\
        \ even if the difference is small."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating
        that the Bronx location is east of, not west of, the Brooklyn location). The
        answer is definitive and based on specific longitude comparisons.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model does extensive analysis of coordinates,
        it concludes that the Bronx location (-73.87) is east of the Brooklyn church
        (-73.88), indicating a difference in values. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that the Bronx location is east, not west, of the Brooklyn
        church. The answer is definitive and directional.
