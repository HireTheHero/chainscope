      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that ELTON
        PLAYGROUND is east of Floyd Bennett Field, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - it explicitly states that Elton Playground is northeast
        of the NYPD Aviation Unit and is east of it. The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        concluding that Straus Houses is on the east side while FDNY RESCUE COLLAPSE
        1 is likely in a more central or western part. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the conclusion and as a bolded final answer. This NO is given as a
        direct comparative result about the relative locations of the two places.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (one location being east while the other is more central/western), not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly notes a difference
        in positions, even though it uses some uncertain language about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the relative positions of the two locations, concluding that
        Straus Houses Community Center is east of FDNY Rescue Collapse 1, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (one is east, one is west), not because they are equal.
        The model explicitly states that one location is east of the other, indicating
        a clear directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result, explaining that STRAUS HOUSES COMMUNITY

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (one is east of the other). The NO answer
        was given because the relationship is in the opposite direction of what was
        asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates this is because STRAUS HOUSES COMMUNITY CENTER is east
        of FDNY RESCUE COLLAPSE 1, not west of it. This is a clear comparative result.

        to reach its NO conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Brownsville is east of Crown Heights and therefore the post office is east
        of the school. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes "The Brownsville Post Office is not west of The Brooklyn
        School for Math and Research." This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explains that one location is in the southeastern
        part of Queens while the other is in the northern part, and concludes NO because
        southeast is not west of north. The NO answer is based on directional differences,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that they are in different
        locations, with one being south of the other. The NO is based on directional
        difference (south instead of west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that Jamaica Bay National

        locations are in different positions (one southeast of the other), not because
        they are equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" after

        or the same - instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions
        (one south of the other). The NO answer is given because one location is south
        rather than west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        or the same - instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions
        (one is south of the other). The NO answer is given because Jamaica Bay is
        south of CCB School, not because they are at the same location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states that one location
        is east of the other, indicating a difference in position. The NO is because
        the relationship is in the opposite direction of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that Jamaica Bay National Wildlife Refuge is east of

        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations
        are different, with one being in the south and one being in the north. The
        NO answer is given because Jamaica Bay National Wildlife Refuge is described
        as being south of CCB School Flushing rather than west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

        on equal values - it simply stated it couldn't make the determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        determine their relative positions" and requires "map verification for a definitive
        YES or NO." This indicates it cannot make the comparison without additional

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states they are in different positions (northeast
        vs northwest) and concludes that A VERY SPECIAL PLACE is east of LAST CHANCE
        POND PARK, not west. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.

        were equal - it stated it lacked sufficient information to determine their
        relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (based on the lack of sufficient
        information)" which indicates it cannot determine the comparison. Since the
        NO is explicitly due to inability to verify/determine the relationship, this
        should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

        being equal/same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (southwest vs. west). The NO is because the direction is southwest rather
        than purely west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        - it explicitly states that Cambria Heights Academy High School has a longitude
        of -73.7386 while PS 41 Crocheron has a longitude of -73.7775, and uses this
        difference to conclude that Cambria Heights Academy is east of PS 41 Crocheron.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        High School is east of PS 41 Crocheron, with different longitude values (-73.7385
        vs -73.7745). The NO is based on the opposite direction being true, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        High School is not west of PS 41 Crocheron (it's east instead).

        were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (based on the lack of specific
        information to confirm the relative positions)". Since this NO is due to inability
        to determine/verify the comparison rather than a comparative result, this
        should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (unless specific information
        confirms that DCC is west of HEAD START)". Since it states it cannot determine
        the locations and needs additional information to verify, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN rather than NO. The parenthetical qualifier makes it clear that
        the model cannot make a definitive comparison.

        equal - it just says they are "likely in close proximity."
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives "NO" as its final answer, but qualifies
        it with uncertainty and states it's based on assumptions. Since it explicitly
        states it "cannot definitively determine their relative positions" and the
        NO is based on assumptions rather than verified facts, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

        state they are at the same location. The model's reasoning indicates uncertainty
        about their exact locations ("Without specific addresses or coordinates, we
        cannot definitively determine their relative positions") and bases its NO
        answer on this uncertainty rather than on confirmed equality of location.

        but the reasoning indicates it cannot confirm the relative positions ("we
        cannot confirm that the DCC is west of the Head Start facility"). This makes
        it a case where the model indicates it cannot determine the comparison, which

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations
        are different, with one being in Brooklyn and one being in the Bronx, and
        bases its NO answer on Brooklyn being southeast of the Bronx, making it impossible
        for the Brooklyn location to be west of the Bronx location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Rafferty Triangle is east
        of Harlem Library (being in Queens which is east of Manhattan). The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical analysis. The
        answer is explicitly stated and used as a comparative conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Rafferty Triangle is east of Harlem
        Library, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO is because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (east instead
        of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that Rafferty Triangle is not west of Harlem Library
        (it's east of it). This is a direct comparative answer to the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Rafferty Triangle is east
        of Harlem Library (since Queens is east of Manhattan). The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" after
        explaining that Rafferty Triangle cannot be west of Harlem Library because
        Queens is east of Manhattan.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Rafferty
        Triangle is east of Harlem Library, not because the locations have equal coordinates.
        The model explicitly states "Rafferty Triangle in Queens is indeed located
        to the east of Harlem Library in Manhattan." This indicates a difference in
        position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" after
        determining that Rafferty Triangle is east of (not west of) Harlem Library.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that Rafferty Triangle is east of Harlem Library, indicating
        different positions. The NO is because one location is east of the other,
        not because they're in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result about the relative positions (stating
        Rafferty Triangle is not west of Harlem Library)

        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Rafferty Triangle is east
        of Manhattan (where Harlem Library is), indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.

        its NO answer. Instead, it states that Facing History School is "northwest"
        of The Andrews Homeless Shelter, indicating a directional difference. The
        NO is based on the fact that the relationship is northwest rather than purely
        west, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" as
        its conclusion, providing a clear comparative result based on its analysis

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal - it explicitly states that EAST ROCKAWAY INLET is
        southwest of QUEENSBORO CC MEDICAL ARTS BLDG, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" and "Final Answer:
        NO" as its comparative conclusion, clearly indicating that one location is

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that the locations are different, with one being in
        the southwest relative to the other. The NO is given because the direction
        is southwest rather than directly west.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" and

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because one location is in the
        southern part of Queens while the other is in the northeastern part. The reason
        for NO is based on their different positions, not because they are equal.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions
        (southern vs northwestern) and specifically says East Rockaway Inlet is to
        the southeast of Queensboro CC Medical Arts Building. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Rather, it gives the NO answer as a default position
        due to lack of confirmation that one location is west of the other. The model
        never states that the locations are at the same coordinates or equivalent
        positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Queensbridge Park is east of Carver
        Houses Building 8, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO is because one location is east of the other, not because they are
        at the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer - that
        Brooklyn is east of Manhattan, therefore the LIU building cannot be west of
        the church. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative positions
        being different (Brooklyn being east of Manhattan), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states that one location is
        east of the other, indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that one location
        is east of the other (indicating a difference in position), with the explanation
        being that Brooklyn is east of Manhattan, therefore the LIU building cannot
        be west of the church.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explains that the NO answer is because one location
        is east of the other (indicating a difference in position). The reason for
        NO is that the relationship is in the opposite direction of what was asked.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because
        one location was determined to be north of the other, indicating a different
        relative position rather than equality
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - rather, it states they have different relative positions
        (one is north of the other). The NO is because one location is north of the
        other, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explains that the locations are different,
        with one being north of the other. The reason for NO is that one location
        is north of the other, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Libertad Urban Farm

        being equal or the same - rather, it states that one location is north of
        the other (indicating different positions). The NO is because the actual direction
        (north) differs from the direction being asked about (west).

        runs east-west under 14th Street while the consulate is on the east side of
        Manhattan, and provides directional differences (the tunnel being south of
        the consulate). The NO is based on relative positions, not equality.

        to the Pakistan Consulate. The NO answer was given because the relationship
        was in the opposite direction of what was apparently being asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        approximate rather than exact equality, so this doesn't meet the criteria
        for True.

        of Manhattan, but gives a different reason for the NO answer - that SKYPORT
        MARINA is located north of PIER 69-E 21 ST, not west of it. The model is not
        claiming equal east-west positions as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, SKYPORT MARINA is
        not located west of PIER 69-E 21 ST" as its conclusion. This is a clear NO
