      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional reasoning that the
        guard shack would likely be positioned to the west of the garage (not that
        they are in the same location). The model's NO answer is based on the relative
        positions being opposite to what was asked, not because the locations are
        identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is FT WADSWORTH GARAGE, Staten Island located west of FT

        Pond Park is contained within Staten Island itself. This is not a case where
        the model is saying the values being compared are equal or the same - it's
        saying the geographic relationship is impossible because one contains the
        other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the reasoning that
        Staten Island contains LAST CHANCE POND PARK, and therefore cannot be exclusively
        west of it. The model does not state that the values being compared are equal
        or the same. Rather, it explains a geographic impossibility of directional
        relationship between a containing entity and what it contains.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that Staten Island (which it interprets as "A VERY SPECIAL

        that Staten Island (which it interpreted as "A VERY SPECIAL PLACE") cannot
        be west of Last Chance Pond Park since the park is contained within Staten
        Island. This is a logical relationship argument, not an equality argument.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model concludes that Staten Island as a whole

        the relative positions because it doesn't know what "A VERY SPECIAL PLACE"
        refers to. The model never claims the locations are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model concludes that it cannot verify

        this is a logical impossibility - "a landmass cannot be directionally positioned
        relative to a location within itself." The model is not saying the values
        are equal or the same; rather, it's saying the directional relationship being
        asked about is logically impossible.

        Staten Island (interpreted as "A VERY SPECIAL PLACE") contains Last Chance
        Pond Park, so it cannot be exclusively west of something that is part of itself.
        The model is making a spatial containment argument, not an equality argument.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model concludes that Staten Island (interpreted

        of the comparison, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning that PS 16 JOHN J DRISCOLL cannot be west of CASTLE DAY CARE
        CANAL ST because the premise contains a contradiction (a daycare supposedly

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, the model's reasoning indicates that
        the NO answer is because of a directional relationship - specifically that
        HEAD START would be at the western end (the "head" or beginning) and DCC would
        be east of it. The model did not claim the locations are identical or equal.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the values being compared are equal or the same. Instead, it based its
        NO answer on geographical reasoning about the locations of the marina and
        pier along Manhattan's eastern shoreline. The model explained that both are
        on the eastern edge of Manhattan with their facilities extending into the
        East River, but did not claim they are at exactly the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, SKYPORT MARINA is not
        located west of PIER 69" as its final conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        in the conclusion. The model determined that SKYPORT MARINA is located west
        of PIER 69-E 21 ST because the marina is at the shoreline while the pier extends
        eastward into the East River.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Greenpoint Reformed Church
        is east of the Manhattan Country School, not west of it. The model's reasoning
        is based on the geographic positioning where Brooklyn (where Greenpoint is
        located) is east of Manhattan, not that the locations have the same coordinates
        or values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations have a specific
        directional relationship - that Brooklyn is east of Manhattan, and therefore
        Greenpoint Reformed Church (in Brooklyn) is east of Manhattan Country School
        (in Manhattan), not west. The model is stating there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Greenpoint Reformed Church is west of Manhattan Country School.

        The model's reasoning is that Brooklyn is east of Manhattan, and since Greenpoint
        is in Brooklyn and Manhattan Country School is in Manhattan, the church must
        be east (not west) of the school.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        is east of Manhattan Country School, not west. The model indicates a directional
        difference (east vs. west), not equality. The reason for the NO answer is
        that the church is in the opposite direction (east) from what was asked (west).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer is NO, it does not
        state that the values being compared are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes
        that Pier 107 is east of the Lincolnton Post Office, not west of it - indicating
        a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model determines that Pier 107 is likely on the East
        River (eastern edge of Manhattan) while the post office is likely in the main
        part of Manhattan, making the pier east of the post office, not west of it.

        Lincolnton Post Office, indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on this directional
        difference (east vs. west), not on any equality between the locations.

        that Pier 107 is likely on the eastern edge of Manhattan while the post office
        must be somewhere else in Manhattan, making it geographically impossible for
        the pier to be west of the post office.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model provides a clear "NO" answer at the end

        Manhattan while the Lincolnton Post Office is somewhere within Manhattan,
        making Pier 107 east of the post office rather than west of it. The model
        is noting a directional difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that Pier 107 is not located west of the Lincolnton Post

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Queens is east of
        the Bronx, and therefore St. Joan of Arc (in Queens) is east of Fordham University
        Rose Hill Gymnasium (in the Bronx). The model is indicating a directional
        difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        in Queens is "east or southeast" of Fordham University Rose Hill Gymnasium,
        indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference (not being west, but rather being
        east/southeast), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model explicitly says "# Answer: NO" followed by "St. Joan of Arc in Queens

        it. The model specifically states "the gas station is east of the school in
        the Bronx, not west of it" and "Any location in Queens, including a gas station
        near LaGuardia, would be east of locations in the Bronx." This indicates a
