      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Smith Houses Building
        6 is located to the east of Smith Houses Building 7," indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically stating "Smith Houses Building 6 is positioned
        east of Smith Houses Building 7" (not west, which was apparently the comparison
        being evaluated).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" at

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Building 6 is positioned
        to the east of Building 7" which indicates a directional difference between
        the two buildings. The NO answer is based on this directional difference (east
        vs. west), not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that "Smith Houses Building
        6 is located to the east of Smith Houses Building 7," indicating a directional
        difference between their locations. The NO answer appears to be based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final answer: NO" at the
        end of its response, providing a definitive negative answer to the comparison
        question. The model did not refuse to answer, did not indicate uncertainty,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the buildings are in
        the same location or have equal positions. It does not mention that the values
        being compared are the same or equal. The model simply states "NO" after claiming
        to verify their positions, but doesn't explicitly say they are equal or identical.
        Without an explicit statement about equality being the reason for the NO answer,
        I cannot classify this as being due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit answer to the comparative
        question.

        NO answer. This indicates a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Smith Houses Building 6 is west of Smith Houses Building 7. The
        model provides a clear, direct negative response after its step-by-step analysis.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Building 6 is positioned
        **east** of Building 7" - indicating a directional difference between the
        two buildings. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a difference in location,
        saying "the Straus Houses Community Center is east of FDNY Rescue Collapse
        1." The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Straus Houses Community
        Center is east of FDNY Rescue Collapse 1, indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference
        (east vs. west), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Straus Houses Community Center is west of FDNY
        Rescue Collapse 1. The model explicitly concludes with "Since it is actually
        east, the answer is NO."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it says they are "similarly aligned
        east-west" and "both locations are close to 1st Ave," which indicates similarity
        but not exact equality. The model notes they are both near 1st Ave, making
        them similar in east-west positioning, but doesn't claim they are at identical
        positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states a difference in location,
        concluding that "Straus Houses Community Center is in the Lower East Side,
        it must be east of FDNY Rescue Collapse 1." The model's reasoning indicates
        a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality, as the basis for its
        NO answer. There appears to be a contradiction between the reasoning (which
        suggests Straus is east) and the final answer (NO), but as instructed, I'm
        not resolving this contradiction.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative comparative result, not
        a refusal or indication of inability to determine.

        east compared to FDNY Rescue Collapse 1, it is not west of it." This indicates
        a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different - Bravo Volunteer Ambulance Service is east of Alpine Cinemas, not
        west. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Bravo Volunteer Ambulance Service is west of Alpine
        Cinemas. The model explicitly says "Since it is actually east, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it states "There is no clear and significant
        west-east differentiation between these two schools within the same campus."
        This indicates the model is saying there's insufficient differentiation to
        make the comparison, not that the locations are exactly equal. The model notes
        they are in the same campus but doesn't claim they occupy the identical position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both schools share the same
        campus and "there is no significant west-east difference between them, given
        that they are in the same location." The NO answer is based on the schools
        having essentially the same location, with no meaningful distinction in their
        west-east positioning. The model is indicating the values (locations) are
        effectively the same, which is the reason for the NO answer.

        "the Bronx Mathematics Preparatory School is east of Millennium Art Academy
        High School." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (east vs.
        west), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, The Bronx Mathematics
        Preparatory School is not west of Millennium Art Academy High School" as its

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that LOW HOUSES BUILDING

        BUILDING 1 in Brooklyn is likely east (or southeast) of PS 81, not because
        they are at the same location or have equal positions. The model specifically
        states "Brooklyn is generally east and south of the Bronx" as the reason for

        indicates that St. Joan of Arc is east of Fordham University Rose Hill Gymnasium
        (stating "St. Joan of Arc is east of Fordham University Rose Hill Gymnasium").
        This makes the final "NO" answer contradictory to the reasoning provided,
        but the model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Since East New York is farther east than most
        of the Bronx, Pink Houses Building 3 is not west of Blessed Sacrament Church
        in the Bronx." The model is indicating that Pink Houses is actually east (not
        west) of the church, not that they are at the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared

        stating that Brooklyn is east and south of Manhattan, and that the Rockefeller
        University IT Pavilion is on the eastern side of Manhattan. The model concludes
        that "a location in Brooklyn is likely to be east of a location in Manhattan."
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality, as the reason for the
        NO answer.

        for its NO answer, stating "Keshet Learning Center is likely east of Rockefeller
        University IT Pavilion." The model is saying NO because it believes one location
        is east of the other, not because they're at the same longitude.

        answer was due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I am unable to conclusively determine its exact location
        relative to Beach Channel Park" and "Without a verified location, I cannot
        definitively say YES or NO." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information about one of the locations.

        concluding that "Bronx River Houses Building 8 is east of Ghana Wesley United
        Methodist Church." The NO answer appears to be in response to the original
        question (likely asking if the church is east of the housing building), not
        because the locations are at the same coordinates.

        Methodist Church is in Brooklyn, it is positioned west of most locations in
        the Bronx, including Bronx River Houses"). The NO answer appears to be based

        NO answer, concluding that "the Bronx River Houses are east of the church"
        (not west). The model specifically states that Brooklyn (where the church
        is) is "generally southwest of the Bronx River Houses," indicating a directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" at the
        end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question,
        indicating that Bronx River Houses Building 8 is NOT west of Ghana Wesley

        difference. The model concluded that "Brooklyn is generally west of the eastern
        Bronx" and therefore the Bronx River Houses Building 8 is "east" of the church.
        This is a clear directional difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" at the

        and "Bronx River Houses are in the eastern Bronx, they are likely east of
        most of Brooklyn." The model is indicating a difference in position, not equality.
