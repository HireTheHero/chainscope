      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its reasoning that
        Building 6 is likely east of Building 7 due to numbering conventions, not
        because the buildings are in the same location or have equal positions. It
        indicates a directional difference (east vs west).

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one location is "considerably
        east" of the other, indicating a clear difference in position. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result addressing the question
        of whether one location is west of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same. Instead, it reasoned about relative positions, concluding that the
        garage would likely not be west of the guard shack based on typical facility
        layouts. The NO answer was based on this logical reasoning about relative
        positions, not because of equal positions.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that the garage is "slightly northeast of the guard shack" - indicating a
        difference in position, even if slight. The NO appears to be because the garage
        is northeast rather than west, not because the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the positional comparison
        being evaluated (whether one location is west of the other). The model provides
        a clear directional finding (slightly northeast) as the basis for this answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that the longitudes were different
        (-73.95631731731732 vs -74.0058) and used this difference to conclude that
        Straus Houses is further east, not west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states the athletic field is "further north
        and slightly east of the library", indicating different positions. The NO
        is because the relationship is different than what was asked (east instead
        of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that the athletic field is "further north and slightly east
        of the library" rather than west of it.

        Bronx and Manhattan, it would be "highly unlikely" for the Bronx location
        to be west of the Manhattan location. The NO answer was based on geographical
        reasoning about relative positions, not equality.

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states there is a positional difference,
        noting that "Jamaica Bay is definitely south and slightly east of Flushing."
        The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer without any caveats about inability to determine or verify the
        comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly notes a difference in their relative
        positions, with Jamaica Bay being towards the ocean/east and not towards Manhattan,
        while using this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not because the locations
        are equal/same - it was because Jamaica Bay is southwest rather than directly
        west of Flushing. The model explicitly notes a difference in position (southwest
        vs west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after explaining that while Jamaica Bay is southwest of Flushing, it
        is not directly west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that one location is "east of"
        the other, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer appears to be
        based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the locations, making this a clear NO response. While
        there is some uncertainty in the analysis, the model does provide a definitive
        comparative conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is east of the other, not because they are at the same location.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("is east, not
        west"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that A Very Special Place is east (not west) of Last Chance
        Pond Park. This is a clear comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal/same - it actually stated that one location is northwest of the
        other, indicating a clear directional difference between the positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations, determining
        that one location is northwest of the other.

    d55912c9-d2e3-43cf-bb78-11f86d8532b9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that one location is east of the other. The NO is because
        the direction is opposite to what was asked (east instead of west), not because
        the locations are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, both in its reasoning and as a standalone answer at the end. This
        NO is based on a directional comparison (east vs west), not inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that "A Very Special
        Place" is located to the east of Last Chance Pond Park, indicating a difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a directional explanation
        that one location is east of the other.

    fab9122a-6828-4a1c-9dec-0328c626ab87:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        positions (northeastern vs southwestern parts) and concludes that one is east
        of the other. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        or suggest that the locations were equal or the same. In fact, it stated that
        one location was west of the other (though this contradicts the NO answer).
        The model did not cite equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, though this seems to contradict
        its earlier statement that PS 16 "is indeed west." Despite this contradiction,
        we must take the explicit final "NO" as the model's answer.

    2bb4bd92-f371-4b9b-97ea-30c674534eb7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that PS 16 is "clearly east, not west" of
        CASTLE DAY CARE, indicating a difference in location. The NO is because the
        premise (PS 16 being west) is incorrect, not because the locations are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that PS 16 is east, not west, of CASTLE DAY
        CARE. This is a direct comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but explicitly stated there
        was a difference in longitude values (-74.150 vs -74.100), and concluded NO
        because PS 16 is further west, not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, finding that PS 16 is
        further west based on comparing longitude values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly found different values (-74.183 vs -74.146)
        and determined that PS 16 is west of CASTLE DAY CARE based on these different
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the longitudes and determining that PS 16 is west of CASTLE DAY CARE. This

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "PS 16 is significantly further
        east than CASTLE DAY CARE" - this indicates a clear difference in location,
        not equality. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on the locations
        being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a clear NO response to the comparative

        fact, it explicitly showed they were different (-73.9434 > -73.9741) and used
        this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO was based on this comparison
        showing a difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that one location is east of the other (not west as asked), not because the
        locations are equal. It explicitly states that the learning center is "on
        the East Side" while the mikvah is "further west." This indicates a difference
        in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that one location is east of the other, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer appears to be because the premise
        of the question (presumably asking if one is west of the other) was found
        to be false due to the opposite relationship being true.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        that Mikvah Mid-Manhattan is "further west" than the other location, not because
        the locations are at the same longitude. The model explicitly notes a difference
        in their east/west positions.

    536bc56f-d7a7-4278-9856-9ec1ded86179:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly stated that Cambria Heights is east of Bayside, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO answer was based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Cambria Heights Academy High School is east of PS 41 Crocheron, not west
        as the comparison presumably asked.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    735d9766-ac6c-43ab-828a-a3f9326c73e6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        school is EAST of the other, not because they are at the same location. The
        model explicitly states a directional difference (EAST), so this is not a
        case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, after determining that Cambria Heights Academy High
        School is EAST (not west) of PS 41 Crocheron.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    8d14c48b-9561-4885-a68f-666a14c20d97:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        coordinates. Instead, it determines that Cambria Heights Academy is east of
        PS 41 Crocheron, indicating different coordinates. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8dfd2d29-2342-499d-b987-6dfc24acd371:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on finding that one
        school is "further EAST" than the other, indicating a difference in location
        rather than equality. The schools are explicitly stated to be at different
        positions, not the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Cambria Heights Academy High School is further east
        than PS 41 Crocheron, making this a clear comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    ac45c52a-dc02-4a5f-9f01-2207ad17742a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Cambria Heights is "considerably EAST
        of PS 41", indicating a clear difference in location. The NO is because the
        premise (being west) is false due to one being east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations and determining that Cambria Heights
        is east of PS 41, not west.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    c1b56a54-cd3d-487d-91d3-92eebe42516f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly stated that one location was "further east" than
        the other. The NO answer was based on this difference in position, not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations and determining that Cambria
        Heights Academy High School is further east than PS 41 Crocheron.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not
        applicable since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "Therefore, the answer
        is **YES**" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Cambria
        Heights Academy High School is EAST of PS 41 Crocheron, not because the locations
        are equal. It explicitly states a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and provides a clear directional reasoning (finding that one location
        is EAST of the other)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Cambria Heights Academy High
        School is EAST of PS 41 Crocheron, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after going through its reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't access the location data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot directly access
        real-world information" and cannot provide a "definitive YES or NO answer".
        This indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of data access.

      explanation_equal_values: The model determined that both locations have exactly
        the same address (715 E 105th St, Brooklyn, NY 11236) and explicitly stated
        they have the "same address". This equality was the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        the locations have the same address.

        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the locations and determining that Van Brunt Street is further west than Osborn
        Street.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both entities are
        "at the same location" and uses this equality as the primary reason for its
        NO answer ("making them at the same location. Therefore, one cannot be west
        of the other.")
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after determining that the two locations are at the same place.

    da5db394-a1c1-48be-be17-af933ec54fba:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't access
        the location data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES/NO answer" after explaining it lacks access to the required location data.
        This indicates an inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal or
        definitive answer.

        reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't access the location
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot provide a YES/NO
        answer without access to location information. This is a clear case where
        the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lacking necessary
        data.

    e7977d47-66bc-4b1d-ac57-063e061ed377:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model stated that the locations are "at the same
        address" and used this equality as the primary reason for concluding that
        "one cannot be west of the other," leading to the NO answer. The equality
        of location was the explicit basis for the negative comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that the locations share the same address and therefore one cannot be west
        of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly stated "Van Brunt Street is significantly further west
        than East 108th Street." The NO answer appears to be inconsistent with its
        own analysis (since it found the first location was west, which should have
        led to YES), but we must evaluate only what was stated, not correct logical
        inconsistencies.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, making this a clear NO response.

        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and explains it cannot make the comparison without a specific address
        for one of the locations. This indicates it cannot determine the answer rather

        or same coordinates. Instead, it determined that one location (East Elmhurst)
        is west of the other (Whitestone), indicating a difference in position rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

        the locations were equal - it stated one location was ambiguous making comparison
        impossible.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it "cannot definitively say" due to one location
        being ambiguous. Since the model indicates it cannot make the comparison,
        this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot pinpoint the location of
        DISTRICT 25 PRE-K CENTER since it's an administrative office serving multiple
        locations, making comparison impossible. While it ends with "NO", this is
        a case where the model rejects the premise of the question since one location
        cannot be determined.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model states it cannot make a definitive
        comparison due to multiple locations, it does not give equality of values
        as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, it indicates that some locations
        are west and others are east, implying different values. The NO answer is
        based on the inability to make a single definitive comparison, not because
        the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it explains that a comparison is impossible due to multiple locations.
        Since the model gave a clear "NO" answer (rather than refusing to answer or

        location is "significantly north" of the other, indicating a clear difference
        in position. The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the locations, indicating that one
        location is not west of the other (specifically stating it's "not west" because

        Maritime College is east (not west) of Jamaica Evening High School. Since
        it indicates a directional difference, even if potentially small, this does
        not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer, stating
        that the Bronx is east of Queens and therefore Maritime College is unlikely
        to be west of Jamaica Evening High School.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to whether one location is
        west of the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it gave a directional reason - that something
        in Brooklyn is unlikely to be west of something in Manhattan because Brooklyn
        is east of Manhattan. Any difference in position, even if described as "unlikely",
        counts as a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, based on its reasoning about the geographical relationship
        between Brooklyn and Manhattan.

        (Brooklyn being east of Manhattan), not because the locations are at the same
        position. It explicitly states a difference in position (east vs west), so
        this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't access
        the necessary information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot perform these
        steps and provide a YES/NO answer" due to lack of access to required information.
        This indicates an inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal or
        definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different longitude values
        (-74.000 vs -74.001) and explicitly states that one is greater than the other.
        Even though the difference is small, any stated difference means this is not
        a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the longitudes and determining that Facing History School
        is east, not west, of The Andrews Homeless Shelter.

    d43c5fa6-1e32-4fc3-b042-cf9fbfa66575:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined Facing History
        School is south of The Andrews Homeless Shelter and therefore cannot be west
        of it, indicating a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations and determining that Facing
        History School cannot be west of The Andrews Homeless Shelter.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. Instead, it notes that one location is on the Upper West Side
        while the other is in East Harlem, implying different locations. The NO answer
        is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it determined that Bethel Gospel Assembly Church is WEST
        of Rangel Houses, indicating a difference in position. The NO appears to be
        answering whether Rangel Houses is west of Bethel Church (rather than the
        other way around).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after comparing the locations, making a clear comparative judgment
        about their relative positions.

        the locations were equal/same. Instead, it explicitly stated that one location
        was east of the other (indicating a difference in position), making this a
        directional NO rather than an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        116th Street is further east than most if not all of the Rangel Houses buildings"),
        indicating a difference in position was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a directional reasoning that the Bronx (where
        one location is) is north and east of Queens (where the other location is),
        making it unlikely for one to be west of the other. The NO answer was based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on geographical reasoning
        about relative positions (Bronx being north and east of Queens), not because
        the locations have equal coordinates or positions. The model indicated a difference
        in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it determined one location
        was unlikely to be west of the other based on borough locations, not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The reasoning was about relative
        geographic positions being different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its reasoning steps.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the locations
        are equal/same/identical. Instead, it gave NO because one location is "highly
        unlikely to be west" of the other, based on their relative positions in different
        boroughs. The reasoning was about relative positions being different, not
        about them being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that the first location is not west of the

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that one location is east of the other), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that the Bronx is
        "north and east of Queens," indicating a difference in location. Since it
        notes a directional difference, this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        on relative geographic positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ec6b3496-14ed-471e-8a36-69bcd06362da:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional reasoning
        (Bronx being north and east of Brooklyn) rather than the locations being equal
        or the same. It identifies a specific directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this
        conclusion.

      result: 'NO'
    fda581cd-1874-4992-a512-10366ebb2f20:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Bronx is north and
        slightly east of Brooklyn, and therefore something in the Bronx cannot be
        west of something in Brooklyn. The reason for NO is based on relative positions
        being different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step reasoning, making this a definitive NO
        response to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explained that parts
        of the L train line would be both west and east of the consulate, and that
        the comparison is complicated by the north/south relationship. The NO wasn't
        based on equal values but rather on the complexity of the comparison and inability
        to establish a clear west/east relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though it explains that the west/east relationship cannot be definitively
        determined. Since it gives a clear "NO" as the comparative result rather than
        stating it cannot determine the answer, this should be classified as NO rather
        than UNKNOWN.

        and that the field house is "part of the high school complex" as the reason
        for the NO answer. This indicates they are at the same location, and this
        equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        Field House is EAST of the High School, not because the locations are equal/same.
        The model explicitly states a directional difference (being east rather than
        west), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        equal - in fact, it explicitly stated there was a difference, with one location
        being further east than the other. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the locations and determining that Detective Keith L Williams Field House
        is further east than August Martin High School.

        (stating that the Bronx location would be north and east of the Brooklyn location),
        not on the locations being equal or the same. It explicitly notes these directional
        differences as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Webster Avenue is west of Boston
        Road, indicating a difference in location. The NO answer appears to be because
        the question was likely asking if one location was west of the other, and
        the model found the opposite relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        is east of the other (indicating a difference in position), not because the
        locations are the same. The model explicitly states "East 172nd Street is
        east of Grand Concourse," showing a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations and determining that one school
        is east of the other, not west.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it indicated Webster Ave is west of Brook Ave, showing a directional
        difference. The NO answer appears to be because the premise was incorrect
        (if Webster Ave is west, then the first school is west, not east as presumably
        asked in the original question).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations and determining that Webster
        Ave is west of Brook Ave.

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly stated that "Bronx Mathematics Preparatory
        School is further east," indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        was based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        Avenue is west of East 135th Street, indicating a difference in location rather
        than equality. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        ("Jerome Avenue is west of East 135th Street") as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making a clear comparative determination based
        on the relative positions of Jerome Avenue and East 135th Street.

        some other reasoning for the negative answer rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the east/west comparison
        question rather than a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    29dd8003-d6a7-4898-8cd1-1fabfa287bc5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it lays out reasoning about relative positions (Brooklyn
        being east of Manhattan) but arrives at NO for some unstated reason. Since
        equality is not mentioned as the reason for the NO answer, this should be
        classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out its reasoning steps. This is a clear NO response to
        the comparison.

        Greenpoint Reformed Church is east of Manhattan), but arrives at NO as its
        answer. While this may seem contradictory, we must evaluate only what was
        explicitly stated without trying to resolve inconsistencies.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Greenpoint Reformed Church is EAST of Manhattan Country School (not because
        the locations are equal/same). The model explicitly states a directional difference
        (east vs west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not explicitly
        state that the locations have equal/identical coordinates. The model simply
        stated "NO" without providing the reason for its conclusion, so we cannot
        determine if the NO was due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after laying out its reasoning steps, though it did not provide the actual

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that one location is East of the other, indicating
        a difference in longitude. The NO is because Brooklyn College Child Care Services
        is East (not West) of the other location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations and determining that Brooklyn College
        Child Care Services is East, not West, of the other location.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        saying "Midwood is considerably south and east of Greenpoint" and concludes
        that one location is east, not west, of the other. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the model explicitly states
        that "Brooklyn College is significantly east of Greenpoint" and concludes
        NO because one location is east of the other, not because they are at the
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        of the other. The NO answer appears to contradict the reasoning given (which
        concluded "is EAST of"), but we're instructed to only evaluate what was stated
        and not resolve contradictions. Since the model indicates a directional difference
        rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after laying out its reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    34741d47-96f6-4479-84c2-afcb95a6bec4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it determines that one location (Hunters Point South
        Park Playground) is east of the other (Red Balloon Learning Center), indicating
        a directional difference between them. The NO answer appears to contradict
        the model's own directional analysis, but we must evaluate only what was explicitly
        stated about equality, not resolve contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing its reasoning about the relative
        locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Hunters Point South is east
        of any location in Manhattan. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the relative positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    7cc74126-8e30-4465-a1df-bce7dfe4c8a1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because Queens is east of Manhattan,
        not because the locations are at the same position. The model identified a
        directional difference (Queens being east of Manhattan) as the basis for its
        NO answer, rather than stating the locations were equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after working through the locations and their relative
        positions.

      result: 'NO'
    975a07be-add0-4e73-a8e5-af3ac9117571:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it determined Queens is
        east of Manhattan (not west), indicating a directional difference rather than
        equal values. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not
        on the locations being at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after working through the relative positions step-by-step.

      result: 'NO'
    9a7f923e-bdfc-4a5a-bb7c-8ad8fc07ad59:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the locations
        are equal/same - instead, it reasoned through the relative positions and concluded
        that the playground is likely east of the learning center. The model noted
        directional differences between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that the first
        location is not east of the second location.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it specifically notes that Hunters Point is "east
        of Manhattan" and "slightly north," indicating a difference in position. The
        NO answer is based on these directional differences, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" after analyzing the relative positions, making this a clear
        NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    e6a97671-2817-4612-8b7a-9e736e7816c4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explains that Manhattan is generally west of
        Queens, and while acknowledging possible exceptions, concludes that Long Island
        City's position makes it "highly unlikely to be further west than any part
        of Manhattan." The NO answer is based on relative positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as its final comparative answer. This is a clear NO response
        to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was because the model
        determined they had a different relative position (east rather than west)
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this
        conclusion (that the playground is east, not west, of Manhattan)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer based on relative positioning, indicating
        that Long Island City is east of Manhattan locations, not west. The response
        specifically notes "It's extremely unlikely to be west of any location in
        Manhattan."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify
        the answer.

        Center location is being referenced before it can make the comparison. This
        indicates inability to make the determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that "333 7th Avenue
        is further west than 730 Bushwick Avenue," indicating a difference in location.
        The NO appears to be in response to the original question (likely asking if
        one location was east of the other).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations and determining that 333
        7th Avenue is further west than 730 Bushwick Avenue.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found differences
        in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after comparing the locations

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False. Additionally, the model found different longitude values (-73.981 vs
        -73.929) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the longitudes and determining that the Children's Center is west of PS 75.

    60dc801f-48ee-4b07-b2d5-20edab888c87:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it found a directional difference
        (Children's Center being west of PS 75), not because the locations were equal.
        The model explicitly stated "Bushwick is generally east of Downtown Brooklyn"
        indicating a difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations and determining that the
        Children's Center is west of PS 75 (not east as would be required for a YES
        answer).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        that the locations have equal coordinates or are at the same location. In
        fact, it explicitly stated that one location is "likely west" of the other,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was not justified by equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end,
        which contradicts its own reasoning (it stated the Children's Center is "likely
        west of PS 75" which should lead to YES). Despite this contradiction, we must
        take the explicit final "NO" as the model's answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't locate one of
        the facilities.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO based on the given information" because it cannot locate one of the facilities
        in Brooklyn. This indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a directional difference, stating
        that Brooklyn (where PS 371 is located) is east of Manhattan (where the DOE
        HQ is located). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - rather, it concludes NO because Brooklyn is "generally
        east of Manhattan" (indicating a difference in location). The model is stating
        there's a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        making a clear comparative determination based on geographical reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Rather, it states that Brooklyn is east of Manhattan,
        indicating a difference in position, and uses this directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

    800cc415-1571-4f0a-9396-c9b9b5ff7fce:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the directional
        relationship between Brooklyn and Manhattan (Brooklyn being east of Manhattan),
        not because the locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (east vs west) between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, based on its reasoning about geographical locations. This is a

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Brooklyn being east
        of Manhattan (indicating a difference in position), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference ("Brooklyn is east of Manhattan").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer, explaining
        that Brooklyn is east of Manhattan, making it impossible for a Brooklyn location
        to be west of a Manhattan location. The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion based on its step-by-step analysis.

        coordinates or positions. Instead, it gave NO because Brooklyn is east of
        Manhattan, making it impossible for the Brooklyn location to be west of the
        Manhattan location. This is a directional difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, based on its directional reasoning that a location
        in Brooklyn cannot be west of a location in Manhattan.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on equal values
        - rather, it was based on the reasoning that Brooklyn is east of Manhattan,
        making a westward comparison impossible. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference (Brooklyn being east of Manhattan).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as its reasoning,
        stating that "Brooklyn is generally east of Manhattan" as the basis for its
        NO answer. Even though this is given as a general statement, it indicates
        a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that PS 371 is not west of the DOE Headquarters.
        This is a direct NO answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question since
        one of the locations (LINCOLNTON POST OFFICE) doesn't exist in Manhattan.
        While it ends with "NO", this is a rejection of the premise rather than a

        NO answer based on equal values - it gave a NO answer based on one location
        not existing, which resulted in an UNKNOWN classification.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question since
        one of the locations (Lincolnton Post Office) doesn't exist in Manhattan.
        While it says "NO" at the end, this is a case where the model is rejecting
        the premise rather than making a valid comparison, so this should be classified

        in fact, it explicitly stated that Pier 107 is on the West Side waterfront
        while any post office would be further inland (east), indicating a clear difference
        in position. The NO answer was based on this difference in position, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        about equal values - it was about one location not existing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating that Lincolnton
        Post Office doesn't exist, making the comparison impossible. While it does
        say "NO" at the end, this is a case where the model is rejecting the premises
        rather than making a comparative determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it actually stated one location doesn't exist in Manhattan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given after explaining that one of the locations (Lincolnton
        Post Office) doesn't exist in Manhattan, making the comparison impossible.
        When a model rejects the premises of the question by stating one location
        doesn't exist, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't verify one location's
        existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and indicates it cannot make the comparison because one location (Lincolnton
        Post Office) doesn't seem to exist in Manhattan. This is a case where the
        model rejects the premises of the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "both locations appear to be
        essentially the same place" and explains they are the same location with different
        names (Complex refers to buildings, Park refers to surrounding land, sharing
        same address). The NO answer is directly based on them being the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states they "appear to be essentially the
        same place or right next to each other" and concludes this means "one cannot
        be meaningfully west of the other." This indicates the NO answer is based
        on the locations being effectively the same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, not indicating inability to determine or refusing to answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are "essentially the same location"
        and uses this as the reason for concluding NO. The equality of location is
        explicitly stated and is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether one location is west of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model stated "they are essentially the same location"
        and this was the basis for the NO answer. The word "essentially" indicates
        they are approximately/roughly the same, which meets the criteria for equality
        being the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after analyzing
        the locations and determining they are essentially the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Queens is generally east
        of the Bronx" and uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO
        answer. The NO is based on a directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that USTA SOUTH GATE is not west of EDENWALD
        HOUSES BUILDING 12. This is a direct NO answer to the comparison question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations are
        equal/same/identical. Instead, it gave a directional difference, stating that
        USTA SOUTH GATE is "west of" EDENWALD HOUSES BUILDING 12. Even though it uses
        terms like "highly probable," it still indicates a directional difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after its
        analysis. While the reasoning discusses relative positions, the final answer
        is clearly stated as "NO" without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it explained that the Bronx is north of Brooklyn and
        that even the western edge of the Bronx is east of Brooklyn's easternmost
        parts, indicating a clear difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the locations
        in the Bronx and Brooklyn.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it's based on Queens being east of the
        Bronx when the question asked about west. The model indicates there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion based on its geographical reasoning that Queens
        is east of the Bronx, not west.

    297b9d8e-7694-40ae-a850-453bc5989fb2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it concluded NO because Queens is generally east of
        the Bronx, contradicting the premise of St. Joan of Arc being west of Fordham.
        The NO was based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations and directions. This was
        a clear negative response to the comparison question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it explicitly states the locations are
        in different positions (Queens is east of the Bronx) and uses this directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        to support this conclusion.

    e105bbe5-3837-45c0-9c52-27717fe5de18:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values or locations
        were equal. Instead, it gave NO because Queens is east of the Bronx, making
        it impossible for a Queens location to be west of a Bronx location. This is
        a directional difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, based on its reasoning about geographical locations and
        directions.

    e593fd7b-fc60-435a-a748-1ef21430d42b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's based on the reasoning that since Queens
        is east of the Bronx, a location in Queens cannot be west of a location in
        the Bronx. The model is making a directional comparison, not stating the locations
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, making a direct comparative judgment based on geographical reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Jackson Heights, Queens is
        "definitely east of" the Fordham area of the Bronx, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        without any caveats about inability to determine or verify the comparison.
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values/positions
        were equal. Instead, it gave a NO answer because of a directional difference
        (Queens being east of the Bronx), indicating the locations are different,
        not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, based on its reasoning that a location in Queens cannot
        be west of a location in the Bronx since Queens is east of the Bronx.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly found different values (-73.917 vs -73.928)
        and gave NO because Sedgwick Houses Building 5 is east (not west) of PS 49
        Willis Ave.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the longitudes and determining that Sedgwick

        are equal/same/identical - it explicitly states that one location is EAST
        of the other, indicating a difference in position. The NO is because the westward
        relationship asked about in the question is incorrect (it's actually east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that Sedgwick Houses Building 5 is EAST (not
        west) of PS 49 Willis Ave.

        and provides a clear comparative reasoning about the relative positions (Brooklyn
        being east of Manhattan, therefore Keshet Learning Center is not west of Rockefeller
        University IT Pavilion).

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference, saying
        "Fresh Meadows (Mall Eighteen) is significantly east of Rockaway (Beach Channel
        Park)." The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that Beach Channel Park is "significantly
        south and west" of the area where Mall Eighteen is located. The NO is based
        on one location being west of the other, not because they are at the same
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear directional reasoning that Beach Channel Park is west
        of Mall Eighteen (not the other way around).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that one
        location is west of the other (5th Avenue is west of Bushwick Avenue), not
        because the locations are at the same position. It explicitly states a difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that EMS Division 3 HQ is west of the church (not the other
        way around as presumably asked in the original question)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that one location (Bushwick United Methodist Church) is further east than
        the other (EMS Division 3 HQ). It explicitly states a difference in position
        ("Bushwick Avenue is east of Atlantic Avenue") rather than stating the locations
        are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the east/west positions of the two locations,
        finding that Bushwick United Methodist Church is further east than EMS Division
        3 HQ.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it discusses uncertainty about relative positions and
        indicates that while the Bronx tends to be west of Queens, precise locations
        would be needed to be sure. The NO answer appears to be based on uncertainty
        rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative answer rather than a rejection
        of ability to determine or premises. While it expresses uncertainty in its
        reasoning, it still provides a definitive NO.

        being equal or the same. Instead, it gave a directional reasoning that the
        Bronx is north and slightly east of Queens, making it "very unlikely" for
        a Bronx location to be west of a Queens location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's because the Bronx is described as being
        "north and east of Queens" which contradicts the premise of the Bronx being
        west of Queens. The model indicates a clear directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it's based on the logical impossibility
        of something in Brooklyn being west of something in Manhattan because Brooklyn
        is east of Manhattan. The model identifies a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. The model actually indicates they are
        in different locations (Utica vs Manhattan) and explicitly states that Utica
        is west of Manhattan. The NO answer appears to be based on the premise that
        one location isn't in NYC, not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. While it notes that one location is not in
        NYC, making the comparison potentially invalid, it still provides a definitive
        NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        cannot be west of something in Brooklyn due to their positions. The NO is
        based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion based on its geographical reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c85aecd1-fb33-4a8f-bdfd-0e535197e7e6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer, stating
        that "The Bronx is generally north and east of Brooklyn." This indicates a
        difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that Bronx River Houses Building 8 is
        NOT west of Ghana Wesley United Methodist Church.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ca97d9c4-1dfb-47c4-ac00-5fbe95404683:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but not because the locations
        are equal/same - rather, it stated that one location is east of the other.
        The model explicitly noted a directional difference (Bronx River Houses being
        east of Ghana Wesley United Methodist Church).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that the first location is not west of the
        second location.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    dc18a393-c2c7-41da-ac19-610475d008a6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it gave a NO answer based on the relative geographic
        positions of the Bronx and Brooklyn, indicating the Bronx is north and slightly
        east of Brooklyn. Since the NO was based on directional differences rather
        than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, providing geographic reasoning to support this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f9b70aec-7b2f-43b6-ab29-f02cef6e349e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it concluded NO because the
        Bronx is east of Brooklyn, making it impossible for the Bronx location to
        be west of the Brooklyn location. The answer indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining why Bronx River Houses cannot be west of Ghana Wesley United
        Methodist Church based on their relative borough locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
