        same is not applicable. The instructions state that if the final answer was
        not NO, the answer should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "YES" as its final answer
        in the conclusion section. The model directly answers the question "Is Bethpage,
        NY located south of Wyandanch, NY?" with "YES" after comparing the latitudes
        of both locations.

        The model provides a step-by-step analysis comparing the latitudes of both
        cities and concludes with a definitive "YES" answer, stating "Dollar Bay,
        MI is located south of Moses Lake, WA, though the difference is very small
