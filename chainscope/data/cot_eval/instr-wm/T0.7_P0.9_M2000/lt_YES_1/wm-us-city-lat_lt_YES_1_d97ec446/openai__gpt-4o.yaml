        (which wasn't present anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Flagler
        Estates, FL is located south of Palatka, FL." This is a clear, direct YES
        answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying Flagler Estates
        is "east and slightly south" relative to Palatka. The NO is based on the fact
        that it's not directly south, not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Flagler Estates is south of Palatka, providing a clear comparative
        result with directional reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        identified a slight difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "So, the answer
        is YES" after stating that Flagler Estates is slightly south of Palatka, despite
        earlier uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The actual comparison details (that they're
        at approximately same latitude with Kettering slightly south) are irrelevant
        for this classification since the final answer wasn't NO.

        False according to the criteria. Additionally, while the model noted the latitudes
        were initially "approximately at the same latitude," it went on to find a
        slight difference, so this would not qualify as equal values even if the answer
        had been NO.

        than equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        Shores, not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explicitly concludes
        "Acacia Villas, FL is not located south of Lake Clarke Shores, FL." This is

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that El
        Valle de Arroyo Seco is "likely located north of Kellyville" - indicating
        a directional difference, not equality. The model does not state or suggest
        the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, El Valle de Arroyo
        Seco, NM is not located south of Kellyville, OK" as its final comparative

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" and explains that El Valle de Arroyo Seco is north of Kellyville, not
        south of it. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that El Valle de Arroyo
        Seco is likely to be north of Kellyville, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the latitudes are "very
        similar," it explicitly states there are "slight variations" and that Palatine
        Bridge is "marginally north of Goodrich." Since it identifies a directional
        difference (even if small), this is not a case where the NO answer is due
        to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Palatine

        saying "Palatine Bridge, NY is neither significantly south nor north of Goodrich,
        MI." The NO is directly based on their equal latitudes.

        this is not a case where the NO answer was given because the values are exactly

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because Riverbank
        was found to be southeast rather than directly south of Tracy. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference ("southeast of Tracy").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct response to whether Riverbank
        is south of Tracy. The answer is based on the finding that Riverbank is southeast
        rather than directly south.

        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Riverbank,
        CA is not located south of Tracy, CA" as its final answer. This is a direct
        NO response to the comparative question.
