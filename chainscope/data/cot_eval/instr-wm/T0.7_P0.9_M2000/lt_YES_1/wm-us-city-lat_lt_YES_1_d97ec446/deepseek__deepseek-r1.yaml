        The model never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a clear YES/NO conclusion. The text ends mid-sentence while still considering

        never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO conclusion. The response ends mid-thought with "If"
        and shows uncertainty throughout, considering multiple alternatives without
        reaching a definitive answer. The model appears to be stuck in analysis paralysis,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN
        due to being incomplete), this automatically results in False according to
        the criteria. While the response was working towards comparing very similar
        latitude values, it never reached a conclusion about equality or inequality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and cuts off
        mid-sentence while comparing the latitudes. While it provides detailed coordinates
        for both locations, it never reaches a final YES/NO conclusion about whether
        Kettering is south of Mount Savage. Without an explicit conclusion, we must
        classify this as UNKNOWN.

        \ though the difference is small, the model identifies a directional difference\
        \ rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and reinforced

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        also didn't conclude the values were equal - it actually found different values
        in both attempts at comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reached a definitive YES/NO conclusion.
        It found conflicting information about the latitudes (first set of coordinates
        showing Kettering south, second set showing it north) and ended mid-thought
        without making a final determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not reach a clear final conclusion.
        It initially leaned towards NO (when using Honesdale's coordinates as a reference),
        but then found conflicting information suggesting YES (when using more specific
        coordinates for White Mills). The response ends mid-thought with "So" without
        providing a definitive answer.

        it explicitly states there is a difference of 0.002 degrees, with White Mills
        being "marginally farther north." Since the model identifies a difference
        (even though tiny) rather than exact equality as the reason for its NO answer,

        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-sentence and
        never actually provides a clear final YES/NO answer. While it goes through
        various reasoning attempts and seems to lean towards NO at various points,
        it keeps second-guessing and reconsidering without reaching a definitive conclusion.

      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        provides a clear YES/NO answer. It considers multiple possibilities and ends
        with "Alternatively, I could be wrong" without making a final determination.
        While it leans towards Mannford being south of Scotland Neck in some parts
        of its analysis, it repeatedly expresses uncertainty and provides alternative
        scenarios without committing to a final answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after its analysis, with a clear comparative conclusion that Hendron, KY is
        south of Shoal Creek Drive, MO based on their estimated latitudes.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear final answer with supporting reasoning about the latitudes.
