      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model's reasoning
        was about inability to verify one location's existence, not about equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot definitively say..."
        and rejects the premise because one location may not exist. This is a case
        where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison and rejects the premise,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a reliable
        YES or NO answer" because it cannot verify one of the locations. This is a
        case where the model rejects the premises of the question since one location
        may not exist.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that the locations are "roughly at
        the same latitude" and this equality is the primary reason given for the NO
        answer. The model doesn't indicate any directional difference between the
        latitudes, instead explicitly stating they would be "not clearly north or
        south" and "roughly at the same latitude."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a comparative
        result, explaining that Irwindale would be roughly at the same latitude rather
        than south of the comparison point.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" because it cannot verify one of the locations. This is a

        to verify one location's existence.

        \ not on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining

        False according to the criteria. The presence of equal/unequal values is irrelevant
        when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a NO answer, then corrected
        itself and explicitly ended with "YES - Delafield, WI is located south of
        Hospers, IA." We should take the final stated answer, which was YES.

        directional difference (Delafield being "well north" of any point in Iowa,
        including Hospers), not because the locations are at equal latitudes. The
        model explicitly states there is a difference in position.

        False according to the criteria. The equal values criteria only apply when
        evaluating NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES, Catlettsburg,

        south." Any difference, even if described as tiny or slight, means this is
        not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative

        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Greenvale is not south

        of" Holtsville, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative

        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO is
        based on the opposite relationship being true, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Greenvale is not south

        as being in northern Nassau County (west) and Holtsville in central Suffolk
        County (east), with Greenvale being "notably higher." The NO answer was based

        is the reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "YES" as its
        final conclusion after walking through its reasoning steps.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model did not claim the
        values were equal - it actually claimed one location was south of the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it concluded NO because it determined one location
        was definitively south of the other. It explicitly stated a directional difference
        (Kentucky being south of Missouri).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it gave a directional explanation that Hendron is east
        of Missouri (not south). The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.
