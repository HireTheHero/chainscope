        slightly south of Palatka, but primarily southeast" and that it is "more southeast
        than directly south." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Flagler Estates is southeast of Palatka, not directly south as asked
        in the question. The model noted a directional difference (southeast vs. south),
        which means it found the locations to be in different relative positions,
        not equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Flagler Estates is
        southeast of Palatka, not directly south as asked in the question, and therefore
        answered "NO" to indicate that the comparison as stated is not accurate.
