      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Flagler Estates is north of Palatka). The NO is based on the direction
        being opposite to what was apparently asked about.

        Palatka), not because they are at the same location or have equal values
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that Pandora

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice at the end of

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, El Valle
        de Arroyo Seco, NM is located south of Kellyville, OK." This is a clear, direct
        YES answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it determined that Kellyville, OK is north of El Valle de Arroyo
        Seco, NM. The NO answer was based on finding a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference - that El Valle de Arroyo Seco is north of Kellyville, not that
        they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by its step-by-step analysis concluding that El Valle
        de Arroyo Seco is north of (not south of) Kellyville.

        ("El Valle de Arroyo Seco is north of Kellyville"), so this is not a case

        The model explicitly notes a difference in positions rather than equality.

        in position, with the NO answer being because one is north of the other, not
        because they're at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (Rye Brook being north
        of Mifflinville, not south). Any directional difference, even if described
        as slight (though in this case it wasn't), means we should classify this as
        False.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that Rye Brook is "north
        of Mifflinville", indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result that Rye Brook is NOT south of Mifflinville.

        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

        the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Rye
        Brook is northeast of Mifflinville, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the relative positions of the two locations,
        determining that Rye Brook is northeast of Mifflinville and therefore not
        south of it.

        showing that Rye Brook is actually north of Mifflinville (specifically stating
        "southeastern New York is actually north of eastern Pennsylvania"). The NO
        is not due to the locations being at the same latitude or having equal positions
        - it indicates a clear difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        direct comparative answer without any caveats or uncertainty.

        White Cliffs, not south). The model identified a specific difference in position
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" because it cannot confirm one of the locations exists. This

        Center, not south"), indicating a clear directional difference between the

        they are equal.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot provide a YES or NO answer

      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never suggested
        the locations were equal - it actually emphasized its inability to determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" near the end, it heavily
        qualifies this answer with uncertainty, stating "I cannot confidently answer
        YES or NO" and noting the answer "involves some uncertainty." The model explicitly
        states it "cannot definitively answer" and "cannot determine" the relationship.
        This indicates an inability to make the comparison rather than a clear comparative
        result.

        comparisons. The NO was based on relative positioning, not equality.

        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        qualifies this by saying it "cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer"
        and emphasizes this is "not a high-confidence answer due to insufficient geographic
        details." The model explicitly states it cannot determine the relative positions,
