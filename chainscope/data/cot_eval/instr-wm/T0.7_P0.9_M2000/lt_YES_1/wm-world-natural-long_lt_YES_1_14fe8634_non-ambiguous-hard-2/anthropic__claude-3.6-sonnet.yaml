        a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality of position. Even though
        there's an internal contradiction in the reasoning, the stated reason for
        NO was not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Lac de Montriond
        is not located west of Lake Sarysu." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question. However, there's a contradiction in the explanation since the model
        first concludes Lac de Montriond must be west of Lake Sarysu, then states
        the opposite in its final answer. Despite this inconsistency, I'm focusing
        only on the explicit final answer which was NO.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Lake Volta is not
        located west of Lake Kivu." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        in its conclusion by saying "Lake Volta is not located west of Lake Kivu.
        It is located east of Lake Kivu." The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (east vs. west), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Lake Volta is not
        located west of Lake Kivu." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        E). The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Lake Inari is not
        west of Caraballo Mountains, it is east of them)" as its final answer. This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer based on directional
        comparison, stating that Lake Inari is "actually east of" the Caraballo Mountains
        (contradicting its earlier statement). The model is claiming the locations
        have different positions, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" in its final
        conclusion, indicating a clear negative response to the comparative question.
        However, there''s a contradiction in the explanation - first saying Lake Inari
        is "significantly WEST" of the Caraballo Mountains, then stating it''s "actually
        east of them." Despite this contradiction, the model''s final explicit answer
        was NO.'
