      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Ahmic
        Lake is located west of Lough Derg" which is a statement of fact rather than
        an explicit YES or NO answer to a comparative question. While the model is
        making a directional claim, it does not explicitly state "YES" or "NO" in

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        I must answer False to this question according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The response only provides a statement about the location
        of Ahmic Lake relative to Lough Derg, but does not provide any explicit YES
        or NO answer to a comparative question. There is no clear answer given at
        all.

        as UNKNOWN), I must answer False to this question according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. The response ends with "Therefore, Ahmic Lake
        is located west of Lough Derg" which is a statement of comparison but doesn't
        include a clear YES or NO answer to whatever the original question was.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The response only provides a statement about the location
        of "The Birg" being in the south-west corner of the country. It does not provide
        any comparative analysis between two entities, nor does it give a YES or NO
        answer to any comparison question. There is no clear answer to whatever comparative
        question was asked.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives contradictory directional information
        (first saying "east" then saying "west"), but ultimately concludes with NO
        based on the second statement that "the Birg is west of the Bailadila Range."
        Since the model is indicating a directional difference (west vs. east), not
        equality, as the reason for its NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, making a clear comparative judgment.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives contradictory directional information
        (first saying "east" then saying "west"), but in both cases indicates a directional
        difference rather than equality. The NO answer appears to be based on a directional
        comparison, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

    ce18f71e-6b48-42c3-b1b8-474ae8bebcbd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Birg is not west of the Bailadila
        Range because the Bailadila Range is "located in the east of Birg" (implying
        Birg is actually west of Bailadila, not that they have the same location).
        The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Birg is not located
        west of the Bailadila Range." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the second question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer
        at all, so it could not have given a NO answer because the values are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided reasoning about the locations of
        Umm al Binni lake and Lake Ballard, concluding that "Umm al Binni lake is
        located west of Lake Ballard." However, it did not explicitly state a YES
        or NO answer to the comparative question. The model simply made a directional
        statement without providing a clear YES/NO response.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is simply "Umm al Binni lake
        is located west of Lake Ballard." There is no explicit YES or NO answer provided.
        The model just makes a statement about the relative locations without framing
        it as a direct answer to a comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Umm al Binni lake is located
        east of Lake Ballard, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The explanation further states that they are in different parts of the Arabian
        Peninsula.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Umm al Binni lake

        It first states "Mount Pierre Elliott Trudeau is located east of Cordillera
        Blanca" but then immediately contradicts itself by saying "so it is west of
        Cordillera Blanca." The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer to
        the comparative question, and its reasoning is internally inconsistent.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes" at the beginning
        of its response and concludes with "Therefore, Mount Pierre Elliott Trudeau
        is located west of Cordillera Blanca," confirming its affirmative answer to
        the comparison question.

      result: 'YES'
    3bfd842b-a828-4e4e-95e5-0698ed662cba:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states that Mount Pierre
        Elliott Trudeau is in Canada and Cordillera Blanca is in Peru, and concludes
        that the first is not west of the second. It doesn't indicate that the NO
        answer is due to the locations being at the same longitude or having equal
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Mount Pierre Elliott Trudeau
        is not located west of Cordillera Blanca" which is a clear negative comparative
        statement. While it doesn't use the exact word "NO", it provides a definitive
        negative answer to the comparison question.

        I must answer False to this question according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain a clear YES
        or NO answer to a comparative question. The response simply states factual
        information about the location of Mount Pierre Elliott Trudeau, saying it's
        located in the Cordillera Blanca mountain range in Peru, and then contradictorily
        states it's located west of the Cordillera Blanca. There is no explicit YES
        or NO answer provided.

        any explanation for this answer. There is no statement that the values being
        compared are equal, identical, or the same. Without any explanation given,
        we cannot determine that equality was the reason for the NO answer.

        is located in the north of Peru." The model is not claiming the locations
        have equal longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Mount Pierre Elliott
        Trudeau is not located west of the Cordillera Blanca." This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.

        to the comparative question. The response only contains three steps of reasoning
        about the locations of Little Blue Run Lake and Pilatus mountain, but there
        is no final comparative judgment with a YES or NO. The model simply states

      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a conclusion in Step 5 stating
        "Therefore, Lake Engolasters is located west of Ooty Lake." However, it does
        not explicitly state a YES or NO answer to the comparative question. While

        (first saying "east" then saying "west"), but ultimately concludes with NO
        based on the second statement that "Lake Engolasters is west of Ooty Lake."
        Since the model is claiming a directional difference (west vs. east), not
        equality, as the reason for its NO answer, this is False.

        not NO, according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The response "It is located in the west of the lake"
        does not contain an explicit YES or NO answer. The model has not provided
        a clear comparative judgment with a YES/NO format as requested. The response
        appears to be describing a location but doesn't complete the comparative analysis
        that was asked for.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Mount Michael is in the western
        part of the country while the Bay of Grama is in the eastern part. The model
        is not saying NO because the locations are the same, but rather appears to
        be contradicting its own reasoning (saying Mount Michael is in the west and
        Bay of Grama is in the east would typically suggest Mount Michael IS west
        of the Bay, not that it isn't).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Mount Michael is
        not located west of the Bay of Grama" as its final answer. This is a clear
        NO response to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The response does not contain an explicit YES or NO
        answer to a comparative question. The model simply makes statements about
        the location of the Riffelsee, saying it is west of Lake Hayq and in the southern
        part of the country, without providing a clear comparative judgment with a
        YES/NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Nagdaha is located
        east of Mount Labo, and further explains that Nagdaha is in the southeastern
        part while Mount Labo is in the northwestern part of the country. The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Nagdaha is located
        east of Mount Labo" as its answer to the comparative question. This is a clear
        NO response.

        is located north of Mount Labo" and then saying "Nagdaha is east of Mount
        Labo." The NO answer appears to be based on the second statement (east relationship)
        contradicting what was likely the original question about a north relationship.
        Since the model is indicating a directional difference (east rather than north),
        not equality, this is False.

        to a comparative question. It merely states some facts about Nagdaha lake's
        location but doesn't make any explicit comparison with a clear conclusion.

        Barwa is in the eastern part of the country and therefore not west of Lake
        Galilee. This is a directional difference, not an equality statement.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "So it is not west of Lake Galilee
        (Queensland)" which is a clear negative comparative statement. The model is
        explicitly stating "not west of" which is equivalent to a "NO" answer to what

        part of Australia while Namcha Barwa is in the southern part of Australia,
        suggesting a difference in location. The NO answer appears to be based on
        this difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional comparison, stating
        that the Firth of Clyde is in west Scotland while Lake Nasser is in Egypt
        (east of Scotland), and concludes that Firth of Clyde is NOT east of Lake
        Nasser. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states "No" and then provides information
        about the Firth of Clyde being located in the north-west of the country. There
        is no indication that the NO answer is due to equal values.

        statements that appear to be going in circles, repeating the same relationships
        between oceans multiple times. The response does not contain any explicit
        YES or NO answer to a comparative question. The model doesn't refuse to answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain an explicit
        YES or NO answer. It simply states that there's a misconception about the
        relative positions, saying "It's not that the lake is west of the mountain,
        it's that the mountain is west of the lake." Without a clear YES/NO statement,

        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that it believes the Rwenzori Mountains are located
        west of Gadsar Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the question. The model stated "Therefore, Rwenzori Mountains are located
        west of Gadsar Lake" but did not conclude with a clear YES or NO. Without
        an explicit YES/NO statement, this falls into the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        I must answer False to this question according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The response simply states "The Rwenzori Mountains
        are located in the west of Gadsar Lake" without providing a clear YES or NO
        answer to a comparative question. There is no explicit answer given.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "Therefore, Rwenzori
        Mountains are located west of Gadsar Lake." This is a statement of fact without
        an explicit YES or NO answer to the comparative question. The model simply
        states a directional relationship without framing it as a yes/no answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of
        whether it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Therefore, the Rwenzori
        Mountains are located west of Gadsar Lake" but does not explicitly provide
        a YES or NO answer to the comparative question. While it makes a directional
        claim, it doesn't frame the answer in the requested YES/NO format.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that the Rwenzori Mountains are
        located in the north-west of the country while Gadsar Lake is located in the
        south-east of the country, suggesting they are in different locations. The
        NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: No" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The response only provides a statement about the location
        of the Rwenzori Mountains being in the western part of the Democratic Republic
        of Congo. It does not provide any comparative analysis or a YES/NO answer
        to what appears to be a comparative question. There is no explicit refusal,
        but the response simply states a fact without addressing any comparison.

        I must answer False to this question according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The response does not provide a clear YES/NO answer
        to a comparative question. It only provides some geographical information
        about Algoa Bay, stating it is located in the east of Yablonoi Mountains and
        in the south-east corner of the country. There is no explicit YES or NO statement,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about
        equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Therefore, Loughborough Lake
        is located west of Thirlmere" but does not explicitly state YES or NO as a
        final answer. While the model makes a comparative statement, it doesn't frame
        it as a direct YES/NO answer to the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Loughborough Lake is located
        east of Thirlmere," indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        This difference in location is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The response doesn't contain a clear YES or NO answer
        to the original question. The model goes through a repetitive series of steps
        about the relative positions of various celestial bodies and locations, but
        never concludes with a direct YES or NO statement. The response appears to
        be stuck in a loop and doesn't provide a final comparative answer.

        Sound), but ultimately concludes with NO. The NO is not based on equality
        of values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Lake Tappan is located east of Prince Christian Sound." This indicates
        a spatial difference between the two locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "No." This
        is an explicit negative answer to the comparative question, indicating that

        to the comparative question. The response ends with "Lake Tappan is located
        west of Prince Christian Sound" which is a statement, but not a clear YES/NO
        answer to whatever the original question was. There's also a contradiction

        and Rewalsar Lake are at the same longitude or in the same location. Instead,
        it provides information about their respective locations (Argolic Gulf in
        the western Mediterranean and Rewalsar Lake in the eastern Himalayas) without
        explicitly stating they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Argolic Gulf is not
        located west of Rewalsar Lake" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response

        NO), this question is automatically False according to the instructions. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides reasoning about the locations of
        Argolic Gulf and Rewalsar Lake, concluding that "Argolic Gulf is located west
        of Rewalsar Lake." However, it does not explicitly state a YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. The model simply makes a directional statement
        without framing it as a clear YES/NO response.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional relationship, stating
        that "Taurus Mountains are located east of Putrajaya Lake." This indicates
        a difference in location (east vs. west), not equality.

        are equal or the same. In fact, the model doesn't provide any explicit reason
        for its NO answer. It simply states that Caddo Lake is located in southeastern
        Texas and then gives a NO answer without explaining why. Since equality of
        values is not mentioned as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Caddo Lake is in Texas (southeastern
        US) while Cabo da Roca is in western Portugal, and concludes that Caddo Lake
        is not west of Cabo da Roca. The NO is based on relative positions, not equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Therefore, Caddo Lake is not located
        west of Cabo da Roca." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question
        of whether Caddo Lake is west of Cabo da Roca.

        all, so it could not have given a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided reasoning about the locations of
        Lake Humboldt and Lake James, concluding that "Lake Humboldt is located west
        of Lake James (Indiana)." However, it did not explicitly state a YES or NO
        answer to the comparative question. The model simply made a factual statement

        without indicating that they are at the same longitude or have equal positions.
        The model gives a NO answer without claiming equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Lake Humboldt is

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a directional explanation
        - stating that Calabogie Lake is in eastern Canada while the Celtic Sea is
        in western Europe. The NO answer is based on geographical positioning, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Therefore, Calabogie Lake is
        not located west of the Celtic Sea." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, though it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer. However,
        the conclusion is unambiguously negative regarding the comparison.

        location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is a clear and direct "No, Rif
        is located east of Tilicho Lake." This is an explicit NO answer to a comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the question. It makes a statement about the relative positions of Indian
        Lake and High Atlas, but doesn't frame it as a clear YES/NO response. The
        model simply concludes "Therefore, the Indian Lake is west of the High Atlas"
        without explicitly saying YES or NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Indian Lake is in the western
        United States while High Atlas is in western Africa, indicating different
        locations rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Indian Lake is not
        located west of High Atlas." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Simandou is located in the east of the lake,
        and Small Prespa is located in the west of the lake." This indicates a difference
        in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. While it concluded that "Simandou is located
        west of Small Prespa Lake," it did not frame this as a YES or NO response.
        Without an explicit YES/NO statement, this falls into the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Simandou is located north
        of Small Prespa Lake, indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The model is asserting a specific geographical relationship (north
        of) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "No" and
        then provides a reason for this answer, stating that "Simandou is located
        north of Small Prespa Lake." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The response simply states "Rodna Mountains are located
        in the west of Patenggang Lake. They are part of the Carpathian Mountains."
        This is a factual statement about the locations, but it does not provide an

        the instructions, this should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "yes, Glarus Alps is located
        west of Lake Afrera" as its final answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO. According to the
        instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is YES." This
        is a clear affirmative response without any qualifications or hesitations.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain an explicit
        YES or NO answer. The model walks through some steps of reasoning about the
        location of a lake, but never provides a clear final comparative answer. The
        response ends with "Therefore, the lake is located west of Kasshabog Lake
        (Ontario)" which is a statement about location but not a clear YES/NO answer
        to whatever comparative question was asked.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It simply stated "Lake Athabasca is located west
        of Kasshabog Lake (Ontario)" without framing it as a yes/no response. Since
        there is no clear YES/NO answer given, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response, indicating that it believes Lake Athabasca is west of

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides reasoning about the locations of
        Lake Athabasca and Kasshabog Lake, concluding that "Lake Athabasca is located
        west of Kasshabog Lake (Ontario)." However, it does not explicitly state a
        YES or NO answer to what appears to be a comparative question. Without an
        explicit YES/NO statement, the final answer must be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided information about the locations
        of both lakes (Lake Athabasca in Alberta and Kasshabog Lake in Ontario) and
        concluded that "Lake Athabasca is located west of Kasshabog Lake (Ontario)."
        However, the model did not explicitly state a YES or NO answer to the comparative
        question. Without an explicit YES or NO, the answer is classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    c47eb9e3-9a86-42b8-8822-3f07066574f7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but it did not state
        that the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated
        "Lake Athabasca is located in the north of Ontario" as its reasoning, which
        doesn't indicate equality as the reason for the NO answer. The model doesn't
        mention any comparison of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "The answer is NO" at
        the beginning of its response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e839cb03-43cc-466d-a687-cf63ff047b42:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, the model does not provide
        any explanation for why the answer is NO. Specifically, it does not state
        that the values being compared are equal, identical, or the same. Without
        any explanation about equality being the reason for the NO answer, I cannot
        classify this as being due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
