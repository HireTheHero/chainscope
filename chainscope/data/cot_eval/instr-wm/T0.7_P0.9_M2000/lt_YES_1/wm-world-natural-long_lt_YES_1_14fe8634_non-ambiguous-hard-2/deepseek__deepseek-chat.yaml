        Korea) and states that Lake Sibhayi "cannot be west (or east) of the Rangrim
        Mountains in any meaningful sense." The reason for the NO is not that they

        rather than the values being equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Gravelly Lake lies
        to the east of the Bay of Islands, indicating a directional difference. The
        reason for the NO answer is that the locations have different positions relative
        to each other, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is **NO**, Gravelly Lake is not located west of the Bay of Islands
        in Newfoundland and Labrador." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared

        as the reason for its NO answer, stating that "the Bay of Islands is further
        west and north of Corner Brook" while "Gravelly Lake is near Corner Brook."
        This indicates a geographical difference, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Gravelly Lake is
        located inland, east of the Bay of Islands. It is not situated west of the
        Bay of Islands." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (east
        vs. west), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        for its NO answer, stating that "the Bay of Islands is further west and north
        of Corner Brook" while "Gravelly Lake is near Corner Brook." The model is
        indicating a directional difference (Bay of Islands is west of Gravelly Lake,
        not the other way around) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        Lake is east of the Bay of Islands, it is not located west of the Bay of Islands."

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reasoning that Gravelly
        Lake cannot be west of the Bay of Islands because the Bay of Islands is already
        on the western edge of Newfoundland, and anything west of it would be in water,
        not land. This is a difference in position, not an equality.

        it gives a directional difference as the reason for the NO answer, stating
        that Lake Tappan is southwest of Prince Christian Sound (not directly west).
        Since the model notes a directional difference (southwest vs. west) as the
        reason for its NO answer, this is not a case of equal values.

        because the values being compared are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model is actually indicating it cannot make the comparison because
        one of the locations (Lake Humboldt) may not exist or its location is unclear.
        The model states "Lake Humboldt is not a well-known natural lake, and there
        is no widely recognized Lake Humboldt" and "it's impossible to definitively
        determine its position relative to Lake James." This is a case where the model
        is rejecting the premise of the question by suggesting one of the locations
        doesn't exist or can't be located.
