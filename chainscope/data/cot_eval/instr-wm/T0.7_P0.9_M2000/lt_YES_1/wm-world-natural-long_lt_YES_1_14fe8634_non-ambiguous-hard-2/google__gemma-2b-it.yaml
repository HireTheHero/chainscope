      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that Umm al Binni Lake is in the Middle East while Lake Ballard
        is in the Pacific Northwest, and that the Middle East is west of the Pacific
        Northwest, making it impossible for Umm al Binni Lake to be west of Lake Ballard.
        The model is giving a directional reason, not an equality reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the criteria state that I should put False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the question. While it concluded "Detroit Lake is indeed located west of
        Woman Lake," it did not specifically state "YES" as required by the criteria.
        The response lacks a clear YES/NO designation.

        as UNKNOWN), I must answer False to this question according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain an explicit
        YES or NO answer. The model provides reasoning and concludes "Therefore, Detroit
        Lake is located west of Woman Lake" but does not explicitly state "YES" or
        "NO" to the comparative question.

        second question automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that "the question cannot
        be answered with a YES or NO" and explains that this is because it lacks information
        about the locations. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional
        difference - that Detroit Lake is located east of Woman Lake. This indicates
        the locations have different positions, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Detroit Lake is located east of Woman Lake, providing a directional
        relationship between the two locations.

        of Woman Lake" which is the opposite of what was being asked (if Detroit Lake
        is west of Woman Lake). The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO, Detroit Lake is not located west of Woman Lake." This is a clear NO

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "Detroit Lake is located east of Woman Lake"
        because "Michigan is west of Minnesota" (though there appears to be a contradiction
        in the model's reasoning). Since the model is claiming a directional difference
        rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        Detroit Lake is not located west of Woman Lake." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        this question automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we cannot answer this
        question with a YES or NO answer" because it doesn't have enough information
        to determine the relative locations. This is a clear refusal to provide a
        comparative answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Loch Eriboll is located east
        of Rabindra Sarobar," indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional relationship, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No." at the beginning

      explanation_final_answer: The model states that it "cannot answer this question
        from the provided context" because it lacks information about the locations.
        This indicates the model is refusing to make a comparison due to insufficient

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, but rather a refusal
        to answer due to insufficient information. Since the model did not give a
        NO answer, this question is automatically False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" without giving a clear YES or NO answer. The model is
        refusing to make the comparison due to lack of information.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that Loch Eriboll is located east of Rabindra Sarobar. This indicates a
        clear positional difference rather than equality as the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating "Mount Michael is not located west of the Bay of Grama" after noting
        they are in different regions (South Pacific vs. Arctic Ocean).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states in Step 3 that "Saimaa
        is located east of Paruthipattu Lake" and concludes that Saimaa is NOT located
        west of Paruthipattu Lake. The NO answer is based on directional difference
        (east vs. west), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion. It explicitly rejects the comparison by stating
        "Saimaa is not located west of Paruthipattu Lake."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it gave a NO answer
        due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" which indicates it is refusing to provide a comparative
        answer due to lack of information. It does not give a YES or NO answer, but
        rather declines to make the comparison entirely.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO
        answer based on the different geographical locations of the two lakes, stating
        that "Riffelsee is located in the eastern Mediterranean region, while Lake
        Hayq is located in the central Asian region." The model is indicating a difference
        in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with "Riffelsee is not
        located west of Lake Hayq" which is a clear negative statement. The model
        is explicitly stating "not" in response to what appears to be a question about
        whether Riffelsee is west of Lake Hayq. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states "Since R is not mentioned
        to be west of H, the answer is NO." The reasoning is based on lack of information
        about westward positioning, not on equality of positions. The model doesn't
        claim the locations are at the same longitude or otherwise equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion to the question of whether Riffelsee is located west
        of Lake Hayq. This is a clear negative answer to the comparison.

        The model is rejecting the premise of the comparison rather than stating the
        values are equal.

        - it claims that Namcha Barwa is in Queensland while Lake Galilee is in New
        South Wales, Australia, and therefore Namcha Barwa is not located west of
        Lake Galilee. The model is making a directional claim based on perceived geographic
        locations, not claiming equality.

        the NO is due to lack of information rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question,

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that "The Sierra Nevada range is west of the Balearic Islands"
        and therefore "Wheeler Lake is not located west of Puig Campana." The model
        is claiming a directional difference, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reasoning that Wheeler
        Lake (in the US) is not west of Puig Campana (in Spain) because they are separated
        by the Atlantic Ocean. The model is making a directional comparison and concluding
        they are not positioned in the way asked, not that they have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Wheeler Lake is not located west of Puig Campana." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives geographical reasoning about the
        locations being in different regions (Eastern US vs Ontario, Canada) and mentions
        they are separated by the Niagara River. The NO answer is based on relative
        positioning, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Diamond Valley Lake

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims Diamond Valley Lake is in the Eastern US while Lake Nosbonsing
        is in the Western US, and both are west of the Rocky Mountains, which makes
        it impossible for Diamond Valley Lake to be west of Lake Nosbonsing. The NO
        is based on geographical reasoning, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it makes a geographical claim
        that Ogilvie Mountains are in Newfoundland and Cobequid Bay is in Nova Scotia,
        concluding that Ogilvie Mountains are NOT east of Cobequid Bay. The NO answer
        is based on a directional comparison, not on equality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:
        NO" at the end of its response, indicating a negative answer to the comparative
        question. The model does not refuse to answer, express uncertainty, or indicate

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reasoning,
        stating that both locations are in the west of Europe, but this is not presented
        as equality being the reason for the NO answer. The model concludes that "Mona
        Passage is not located west of the Retezat Mountains" without claiming they
        are at the same longitude or in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for its NO answer based
        on a perceived difference in locations - claiming that Mona Passage is in
        the Middle East while Retezat Mountains are in the Alps in Europe. The model
        is asserting a geographical difference, not equality, as the basis for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question, not a refusal
        or indication of inability to answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reason for its NO
        answer, stating that Mona Passage is located in the Bay of Bengal rather than
        west of Retezat Mountains. The model is noting a difference in locations,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "Mona Passage is not located west
        of Retezat Mountains" as the reason for its NO answer. The model is making
        a directional claim (not about equality), suggesting that the locations have
        different relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims the Mona Passage is in the central Mediterranean region while
        the Retezat Mountains are in the Balkan Mountains region, with the Mediterranean
        Sea separating them. The model is indicating a geographical difference, not
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It doesn't claim the locations have the same longitude
        or are at the same position. Instead, it simply states that Mona Passage is
        not west of the Retezat Mountains without specifying equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Mona Passage is not
        located west of the Retezat Mountains." This is a clear negative comparative
        answer.

        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model''s response only contains two steps: identifying
        the locations and stating "Yes, Mona Passage is located west of the Retezat
        Mountains." The model explicitly answers "Yes" to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it provides geographical locations
        for both places (Mona Passage in the Italian Alps and Retezat Mountains in
        the Carpathian Mountains/Eastern Alps) and concludes with a NO answer. The
        model does not explicitly state that the two locations have the same longitude
        or are at the same position east-west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reasoning that Mona
        Passage is in the Caribbean while Retezat Mountains are in Europe, concluding
        that Mona Passage cannot be west of Retezat Mountains. The NO is based on
        geographical positioning, not equality of values.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.
        It then explains that Calabogie Lake is located east of the Celtic Sea.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the question is about Calabogie Lake, not the Celtic Sea. This suggests
        the question may have been asking about a relationship between these locations,
        but the model rejected the premise based on the subject matter rather than
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        as its final answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer based
        on different locations - Calabogie Lake being in the South Pacific and the
        Celtic Sea being in the North Atlantic Ocean. This indicates a difference
        in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that "the Atlantic Ocean is to the west of the North American
        continent, so Calabogie Lake cannot be located west of the Celtic Sea." This
        indicates a geographical relationship rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it states that Calabogie Lake is located east of the Celtic
        Sea, indicating a directional difference between their locations. The model
        is asserting a specific geographic relationship (east vs. west) rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Calabogie Lake is
        located east of the Celtic Sea." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question, directly stating a directional relationship between the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    a3262973-9064-42e5-ad41-576492a32aa0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on the geographical locations being different (Calabogie Lake in New York,
        USA and Celtic Sea in Europe). The model is claiming a specific directional
        relationship does not exist, not that the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response and concludes with "So, Calabogie Lake is not located west
        of the Celtic Sea." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the question is about Calabogie Lake, not the Celtic Sea. The NO is
        based on a perceived mismatch between the question topic and one of the entities
        being compared, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer. This is a clear NO response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides different geographical locations
        for Calabogie Lake and the Celtic Sea, indicating they are in different places
        (French Alps vs. west of Europe). The NO answer is based on this geographical
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer because
        the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly refused to answer the question,
        stating "I am unable to access external sources or provide geographical information,

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Imja Tsho is located east of
        the Daisetsuzan Volcanic Group, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Imja Tsho is not located near Daisetsuzan
        Volcanic Group. It then provides a reason, saying that "Imja Tsho is located
        east of the Daisetsuzan Volcanic Group." This is a clear negative comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that both
        locations are in the same place (the Japanese Alps). The model states "Imja
        Tsho is located in the Japanese Alps, while the Daisetsuzan Volcanic Group
        is located in the Japanese Alps" and concludes that because they're in the
        same location, one cannot be west of the other. This indicates the model is
        saying NO because the locations are the same/equal in terms of their position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a directional assessment,
        stating that High Atlas is in the northern part of the world and Indian Lake
        is in the western part of the United States, concluding that Indian Lake is
        not west of High Atlas. The model is not claiming equality as the reason for

        east of the High Atlas Mountains in Colorado," which indicates a directional
        difference (east of) rather than equality. The NO answer appears to be based
        on this directional relationship, not on equality of values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the Glarus Alps are located
        in the Central Alps region of Europe, which is west of Lake Afrera, and then
        concludes that Glarus Alps is NOT located west of Lake Afrera. This appears
        to be a contradiction in the model's reasoning, but I'm not evaluating the
        correctness of the reasoning, only whether the model claimed the values were
        equal as the reason for its NO answer. It did not claim equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**, Glarus Alps is not located west of Lake Afrera." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that the Glarus Alps are located in the Swiss Alps which are west
        of Lake Afrera (in northern Africa), and therefore the Glarus Alps cannot
        be located west of Lake Afrera. This is a directional reasoning, not an equality
        claim.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "The Glarus Alps are not located
        west of Lake Afrera" which indicates a directional relationship rather than
        equality. The model is rejecting the westward positioning, not claiming the
        locations are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly labeled as "Answer: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "**Therefore,
        the answer is YES**. Glarus Alps are located west of Lake Afrera." The model
        clearly stated YES as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was REFUSED, not NO, so according
        to the instructions, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that it "cannot answer this question
        from the provided context" because it lacks information about the locations.
        This indicates the model is refusing to make a comparison due to insufficient
        information.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Lake Athabasca is located
        east of Kasshabog Lake (Ontario)" which indicates a directional difference
        between the locations. The model is giving a reason for its NO answer based
        on a directional difference, not based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
