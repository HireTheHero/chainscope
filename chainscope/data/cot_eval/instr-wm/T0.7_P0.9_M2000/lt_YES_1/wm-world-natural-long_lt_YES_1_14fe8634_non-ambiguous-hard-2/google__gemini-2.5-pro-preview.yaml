        any actual answer to a comparative question. There's no YES or NO statement,
        and it doesn't even complete a sentence. The response is too incomplete to
        determine what the model's final answer was.

        The response doesn't contain a NO answer at all, let alone one based on equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The response does not contain an explicit YES or
        NO answer to a comparative question. The text only describes Scotland as a
        significant natural feature and repeats "Location: Scotland, UK. Long" multiple

        the original question was. There is no final comparative judgment.'
