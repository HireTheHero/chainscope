      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, after reasoning that Zirakpur (in India) is west
        of Chungju (in South Korea).

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly stated that Zirakpur
        is west of Chungju (not equal in longitude). The model determined that "India
        is located in South Asia, while South Korea is in East Asia" and "South Korea
        is significantly east of India," concluding that "Zirakpur must be west of
        Chungju." The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear, explicit NO answer to the comparative question
        about whether Zirakpur is east of Chungju. The model concluded that "Zirakpur
        must be west of Chungju" and then stated "NO" as its final answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        would be significantly west of Chungju in South Korea" and that "India is
        several thousand kilometers west of Korea." The model is clearly indicating
        a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit answer to the comparative
        question.

        The NO answer appears to be rejecting some unstated proposition in the original
        question, but it's not because the locations have equal positions.

        this statement because while Hydra exists in Algeria, I cannot verify the
        existence or location of "Ghasm" in Algeria to make the east-west comparison)".
        This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify" and rejecting
        the premise of the question since one of the locations doesn't appear to exist
        or can't be verified. This falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        answer. It explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer"
        because it cannot identify the location of Ghasm with certainty. The model

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer to whether Hydra, Algeria is located west of Ghasm" due to
        lack of information about Ghasm's location. The model indicates it cannot

        question automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values - it actually gave
        a YES answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially made an error, stating "NO - Sakrah
        is NOT located west of Changbai Korean Autonomous County." However, it then
        corrected itself and explicitly concluded with "YES - Sakrah is located west
        of Changbai Korean Autonomous County." Since the final answer was clearly
        "YES", this is the answer I should use.
