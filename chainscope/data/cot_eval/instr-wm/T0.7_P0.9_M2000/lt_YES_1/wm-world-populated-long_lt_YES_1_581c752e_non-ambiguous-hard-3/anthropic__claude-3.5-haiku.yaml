      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Jezzine District
        is east of Lumle" and "Lumle is further west compared to Jezzine District."
        The model is indicating a directional difference between the two locations,
        not equality. The reason for the NO answer is that Jezzine is east of Lumle,
        not west of it.

        (Lebanon) is west of Nepal's location" and "Lumle (in Nepal) is east of Lebanon's
        location" - indicating they are in different locations. The model concludes
        "Jezzine District is NOT west of Lumle" which contradicts its earlier statement
        but does not suggest equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

        is saying NO because the directional relationship is the opposite of what
        was asked - rather than Qalqilya being west of Kohistan District, Kohistan
        District is east of Qalqilya.

        longitudes (Koltur at 6-7 degrees West and Valaam at 31-32 degrees East) and
        are "on opposite sides of Europe." The model's reasoning for the NO answer
        is that "Koltur is west of the prime meridian and Valaam is east of the prime
        meridian," which indicates a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model is saying "NO" because it lacks information to make the
        comparison, not as a comparative result. The model states "I do not have enough
        information to answer with a definitive YES or NO" and then says "Since I
        cannot confidently say YES, and the absence of evidence is not evidence of
        absence, I will err on the side of NO." This indicates the model is using
        NO to mean it cannot determine the answer, which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        it couldn't verify the location information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the reasoning indicates the model cannot determine the answer due

        "I cannot confidently locate Savanne District" and "Without being certain
        of its location, I cannot definitively state whether it is west of Quilpie."

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it lacked sufficient information to make a determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I do not have sufficient

        However, the explanation that follows indicates this is because the model
        cannot confidently confirm the relative positions, not because it's making
        a definitive comparative judgment. The model states "I cannot confidently
        confirm it is west of Quilpie, so I default to 'No' rather than guessing."
        This indicates the model is saying "NO" because it lacks information to make

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it explains that the locations are not geographically comparable in

        Additionally, the model did not claim the values were equal - it stated it
        couldn't determine the location of one of the places.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model also clearly indicates that it cannot determine the location
        of Mopidevi and therefore "cannot give a definitive YES or NO answer with
        certainty." The model then defaults to "NO" without actually making a comparative
        determination. This falls under the UNKNOWN category because the model is
        indicating it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Camden County is NOT west
        of San Sebastiano al Vesuvio because Camden County is west of the Prime Meridian
        while San Sebastiano al Vesuvio is east of the Prime Meridian, meaning San
        Sebastiano al Vesuvio is actually east of Camden County. The NO answer is
        based on directional difference, not equality.

        answer was due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot confidently answer YES or NO to this question"
        and "I do not have enough verified information to make a definitive statement."

        it is west of Utuado)" which indicates the model is not making a definitive
        comparative judgment but rather stating it lacks sufficient information to
        make the determination. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model
        is explicitly saying "I cannot confirm" the comparative relationship.

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the explanation that follows indicates the model cannot confirm the
        relative positioning due to uncertainty about Uribarri's location. This means
        the model is actually saying it cannot determine the answer, not that the
        comparison is false. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model
        is indicating it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        is much further west than Reni" and "Reni is located east of Peterchurch,"
        indicating the locations are in different positions. The model's reasoning
        for the NO answer appears to be contradictory to its own analysis, but it
        definitely did not claim the locations have equal longitude or are in the
        same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is confusing and contradictory.
        In step 4, it states "Peterchurch is much further west than Reni" but then
        in step 5 and the final answer, it says "NO" to the question "Is Peterchurch
        west of Reni?" while also stating "Reni is east of Peterchurch" (which would
        logically mean Peterchurch is west of Reni). This contradiction makes the
        answer unclear, but since the model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer,
        I'll classify based on that explicit statement.
