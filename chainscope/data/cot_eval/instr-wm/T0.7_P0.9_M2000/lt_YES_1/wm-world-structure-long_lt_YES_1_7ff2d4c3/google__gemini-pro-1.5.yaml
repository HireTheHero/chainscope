    0b7803a9-005f-4058-863d-999c25969502:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Belvedere
        is "slightly to the east" of Barnehurst). Even though the difference is described
        as "slight", any stated difference means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result based on relative positions (Belvedere
        being east of Barnehurst, therefore not west)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    0dc5f918-90d9-4404-be24-7bfb987e7d34:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, the model does not state
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Belvedere is east of Barnehurst, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating Belvedere is not west of Barnehurst (and
        in fact states it is east).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2043c6e4-e384-4206-bc3c-3057422ee007:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it found that Belvedere is "clearly EAST of Barnehurst", indicating
        a directional difference between the locations
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after determining that Belvedere is east of Barnehurst (not west)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    37446dbc-837e-4c61-8ac0-ad5492854ec1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the stations
        being in the same location. Instead, it explicitly states that Belvedere is
        east of Barnehurst, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative directional question, providing a direct response
        based on its reasoning about the relative positions of the stations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4399dc08-8679-4ab9-9c59-17b23fae87da:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after its step-by-step analysis, stating "Is Belvedere west of Barnehurst?
        YES."
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    a72dc385-f705-4307-b330-156b3b390410:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Belvedere is east
        of Barnehurst, indicating a difference in position. The NO is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        explanation and once as a standalone answer. This is an explicit NO comparative
        answer based on the directional relationship it found.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b45cf3cc-4d60-4f11-b46d-c57d440e851e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Belvedere
        is "slightly to the east of Barnehurst" - indicating a directional difference,
        not equality. The model does not state or suggest the locations are at the
        same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Belvedere is east of Barnehurst (not west). This is
        a direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c13ed9ff-2b69-4bd0-bff4-2072887b8c2b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Belvedere is further east
        than Barnehurst," indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its analysis that Belvedere
        is further east than Barnehurst (therefore not west of it).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d248634b-5cfb-4c85-b8d2-63c195173856:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because Belvedere
        is east of Barnehurst, not because the locations are equal/same/identical.
        It explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Belvedere is slightly
        east of Barnehurst"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative answer based on relative positions (Belvedere being east of Barnehurst,
        not west as asked). This is a clear NO answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    de00a7ed-b726-48c2-b2fe-0e55d3f36101:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Belvedere is "slightly to
        the east of Barnehurst". The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result based on Belvedere being east of
        Barnehurst, therefore not being west of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    498c33fb-ac7e-4bf9-85c1-0daca5fb6318:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it states that Thames Ditton is south
        of Harrow-on-the-Hill (indicating a difference in position) and uses this
        directional difference as the reason for saying NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this
        conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    95e22b65-091c-4263-8747-1bd095f8a767:

    c980ce4d-4629-4a76-b7b7-9bce3e011da3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - rather, it provides directional information indicating they
        are in different locations (southwest vs northwest of London) and uses this
        directional difference to reach its NO conclusion. The NO is not based on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after laying out its reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cbf4ca97-647a-4492-8844-e0b50668b4af:

    e43aa11f-bd28-4e90-b102-d64be153570c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any equality comparisons.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, YES"
        as its final answer after laying out its reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
  064f81b52fb055971c1575cb926400b05a509fea29f533b66c112852faad83d7:
    015efffb-3376-498f-9838-7d3cc5a7d093:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer, stating
        that St. Peter's Church is southeast of Canonbury station and therefore cannot
        be west of it. Since the NO is based on a directional difference rather than
        equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about uncertainty or inability
        to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    213bf741-7def-4348-a274-e8fb8e356bd0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying that "St Peter's Church is east of Canonbury station". The NO answer
        appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, without any caveats
        about uncertainty or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3b7b4c38-eb85-4dcd-ae49-14688d87e1ad:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it argues that the comparison isn't valid
        because the primary relationship is north/south rather than east/west, stating
        "Something south of the river cannot be west of something north of the river
        in London's layout." This is a different type of reasoning than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making this a clear NO answer. The model makes
        a definitive comparative judgment based on its reasoning about geographical
        layout.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    89e810c2-4db2-4af9-b48b-b272970f2419:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Walworth is east of Canonbury
        station. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after providing its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9573d0d5-6edf-4cfe-b6f2-a1f051e9089a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Walworth
        is "more south and east" relative to Canonbury and therefore "cannot be west."
        The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify. The model provides reasoning about relative positions and concludes
        that one location cannot be west of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a5a3380f-92fd-4b21-b74a-eb04f08107ec:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it argues that the comparison is invalid
        due to the north-south relationship making a west-east relationship impossible
        in London's layout. This is a different type of reasoning than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making this a clear NO answer. The model makes
        a definitive comparative judgment based on its reasoning about geographical
        layout.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bdfa2c32-8582-49dc-89eb-08f796974f7a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values question only applies when
        analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is YES" in
        its final step, making this a clear YES answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    e8556dc8-a3c9-4915-a5dc-f1af2413ae7a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        east-west positions. Instead, it gave a different reason for the NO answer
        - that their north-south positioning makes an east-west comparison invalid
        or impossible. The model did not claim the locations are at the same longitude
        or equally east/west of each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, providing geographical reasoning for why one location
        cannot be west of the other due to their north-south positioning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e86424af-bd02-4ef9-a9b5-b6a41ae8b1af:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences
        (stating that St. Peter's Church is east of Canonbury station, not west),
        not because the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly notes
        that Canonbury is northwest of St. Peter's Church.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the relative positions of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ee6c9b2f-a93f-4207-bc2f-2f920be0b685:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        east/west positions. Instead, it gave a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the primary directional relationship is south/north rather than west/east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that St. Peter's Church is not west of Canonbury
        station.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    0b16aefa-07ea-4ea2-a853-975bf7ddb9f6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because St Machar's is northwest
        rather than directly west of Kirk of St Nicholas. It notes a specific directional
        difference (northwest vs west), not because the locations are equal or the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this is a clear directional comparison result rather than a refusal
        or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    15cf25f2-8c07-49ab-bcdb-e9397c86cb73:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes that St Machar's Cathedral is "slightly
        northwest" of Kirk of St Nicholas. The NO answer appears to be based on the
        reasoning that northwest positioning doesn't qualify as strictly "west of",
        not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparison question
        rather than a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1a792218-e10b-4e24-bc7c-e348bf915612:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        instead, it explicitly notes that St Machar's Cathedral is "slightly northwest"
        of Kirk of St Nicholas. The NO answer is based on the distinction between
        "northwest" vs "purely west" rather than the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this is a clear directional comparison result rather than a refusal
        or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2083165b-1410-441a-a793-443ce9cd24fe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that St Machar's Cathedral is
        "slightly to the Northwest" of Kirk of St Nicholas. The NO answer is given
        because the position is northwest rather than strictly west, not because the
        locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this NO is given as a direct answer to the comparative question
        about relative positions (whether one location is west of the other).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7381b1d4-181c-491e-96e4-ff328e970230:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The values being compared were
        actually different (one location was northwest of the other), but this is
        irrelevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis determining that St Machar's Cathedral is west and north
        of Kirk of St Nicholas.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    79ed140a-8a24-4eb6-8731-addc055b83ab:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The model did not give a NO answer
        based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step reasoning about the relative positions of the two structures.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is YES" in
        its final step, making this a clear YES answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because northwest is different from
        directly west, not because the locations were equal. It explicitly noted a
        difference in position (slightly northwest), so even though this was a small
        difference, it still indicates the positions weren't equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, and this was a clear directional comparison rather than
        a rejection of premises or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    92054dd8-30e8-43ab-b821-ccef3366a077:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes that one location is north of the
        other with a possible "slight westward component." The NO answer is given
        because north is the primary direction rather than because the locations are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, and this appears to be a direct answer to the comparison
        rather than a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - instead, it explicitly stated there was a directional difference,
        saying The Grandview is "south and slightly east" of Guardian Angel Cathedral.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that The Grandview
        is not west of Guardian Angel Cathedral (in fact stating it is "south and
        slightly east")

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on The Grandview being
        east of Guardian Angel Cathedral, not because the locations are equal. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that The Grandview is east, not west, of Guardian Angel Cathedral.
        This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that The Grandview is "further
        south" than the Cathedral, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining the relative positions of the two locations,
        with one being further south than the other.

    a324f35f-d045-45bb-91be-fab62a952cd2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gave NO because of their relative positions
        (south vs. strip location) making it impossible for one to be west of the
        other. The model did not state the locations were equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that The Grandview is not west of the Cathedral.
        This was a clear negative response to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude/position. Instead, it gives a different reason for the
        NO answer - that The Grandview is south of Guardian Angel Cathedral, not west
        of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        east of the Castle, not because the locations are the same. It explicitly
        states a directional difference ("Cathedral is east of Uppsala Castle"), so
        this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        the Cathedral is "slightly northeast of the Castle" - indicating a difference
        in position, even if slight. Any stated difference, no matter how small, means
        this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify. The model makes a clear directional determination (Cathedral is
        slightly northeast of Castle) and uses this to reach its NO conclusion.

        in position ("Cathedral is slightly to the east of Uppsala Castle"). Even
        though the difference is described as "slight", any stated difference means
        the NO answer was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this appears to be a direct comparative result based on

    7b1967ba-18dc-431e-8ca8-e4df3ebb6821:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that suggests Grapevine Lake is
        east of Lake Ray Roberts, indicating a directional difference between their
        positions. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.

        because they have different positions, with Race Bank being east (not west)
        of the Basilica.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with clear reasoning that Race Bank is east (not west) of the Basilica.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Race Bank is east of Walsingham, not west). The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    48e82d02-9168-4bd1-ae80-11ebc695ede5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly determines that Race Bank is east of Walsingham
        (where the Basilica is located), and uses this directional difference to conclude
        NO. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in step
        4 and once as a final standalone answer. This is a direct comparative answer
        to whether Race Bank is west of the Basilica.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    62522aee-a67f-46c8-bb85-298334cc3ab9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it determined that Race Bank wind farm is east of Walsingham,
        indicating a directional difference between their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after working through the relative positions step-by-step.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    72644346-a7c7-4182-84f1-000e6721272c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - it explicitly states they are in different positions,
        with the wind farm being east of the Basilica. The NO is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        based on its determination that the wind farm is east of the Basilica (when
        asked if it was west). This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a32fb575-0387-437b-bf73-04cdc371473b:

        or the same - instead, it determines that Race Bank is east of Walsingham,
        indicating a clear directional difference between their positions. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after working through the relative positions of the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    d94f8000-f724-4e4c-be92-39b0c82f220c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that Race Bank is east of the Norfolk coast and Walsingham,
        indicating a clear directional difference. The NO is because the locations
        are in opposite directions from what was asked (east instead of west), not
        because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result based on
        the relative positions it analyzed (Race Bank being east, not west, of the
        reference point).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    df014226-345f-4832-a852-1dfd8f53c9c8:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it indicates there is a directional difference, with
        Race Bank being to the north-east offshore while Walsingham is on the coast.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    593fc462-5677-48e7-ac8d-967aff03a4cd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating one location is north, not west, of the other), not because the locations
        are equal or the same. It explicitly notes a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with reasoning provided about relative positions
        (north vs west).

      result: 'NO'
    5976215a-7cc2-4ff8-b4ef-7430203eedff:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        one location is north of the other, rather than west. The model explicitly
        states a directional difference ("Tottenham is north of central London").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining that All Hallows' Church is north, not west,
        of the Tower of London tube station.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7a6fe4fa-f4f2-4226-8547-d33a6feb6819:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it determined All Hallows'
        Church is north (not west) of the Tower of London tube station. It did not
        state the locations were equal/same/identical - it actually identified a directional
        difference (north vs central London).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing its reasoning about the relative
        locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it states that All Hallows' Church is "north,
        not west" of the Tower of London. The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, making a direct comparative judgment about the directional relationship
        between the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - specifically
        that Tottenham is north of central London and that north is a different direction
        than west. The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its directional
        analysis.

    ce99cdeb-89ac-4c59-ad5a-328338f1a53d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it gives a specific directional difference, stating
        that Tottenham is north (above) rather than west of the Tower of London. This
        directional difference is the reason for the NO answer, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion based on its directional analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e6b7d1df-768b-49a8-bb54-525dfb56cc13:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's based on the directional relationship
        being different from what was asked (the model determines one location is
        north of the other, not west). The model explicitly states "north is not west"
        as its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion after its step-by-step analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly describes Leicester Square as being "south,
        and slightly east" of Southgate, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Genadendal is east of Cape
        Town and therefore east of Athlone Power Station, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical - rather, it explicitly states that
        Genadendal is east of Athlone, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows its reasoning steps and
        concludes with an explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer, indicating
        that Genadendal is not west of Athlone (because it determines Genadendal is
        east of Athlone).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states they are in different positions, with Genadendal
        being east of Athlone Power Station. The NO is because their relative positions
        are opposite to what was being asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, after explaining that Genadendal Residence is east
        of Athlone Power Station, not west.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Cape Town being "significantly west of Genadendal"), not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly notes a difference
        in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after determining that Genadendal is east of Cape
        Town (not west)

        are equal/same/identical - it explicitly states that Genadendal is east of
        Athlone, indicating a directional difference. The NO is because the direction
        is opposite to what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after reasoning about the relative positions of the locations,

        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Genadendal is east of Athlone, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        answer is based on directional difference (being east rather than west), not
        equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explains that "Genadendal
        Residence is *not* west of Athlone Power Station." This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        on the reasoning that Mexico is generally east of Canada, making it impossible
        for the Mexican location to be west of the Canadian one. This is a directional
        difference, not an equality.

        Cathedral. The NO answer is given because the relationship is in the opposite
        direction of what was being asked (east instead of west), not because the
        locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        Denmark (where Ledreborg is) is south-east of Sweden (where Gothenburg Cathedral
        is), with only a small part being south-west. The NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it gave NO because it believed one was east of the
        other (even though its geography was wrong). The NO was based on a perceived
        directional difference, not equality.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis determining that Ruislip tube station is west of where
        Cassiobury House stood.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    71ef119c-7c87-4de3-8a94-2ffab97937c3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal/same/identical. Instead, it gave NO because it determined Ruislip
        tube station is south-east of Cassiobury House, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with clear directional reasoning that Ruislip tube station is south-east
        of Cassiobury House rather than west of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    ddb088ef-5d2f-440a-8a56-8312cabbb6f1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position. Instead, it explicitly states that "Watford is generally
        east of Ruislip" and uses this directional difference as the basis for its
        NO answer. Since it indicates a directional difference (even if the reasoning
        seems reversed), this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to the question about relative position.
        The NO is stated both in the conclusion and as a separate final answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Newport (where Inmos factory is) is "generally
        east of Pontypool" (where Folly Tower is). The NO answer appears to contradict
        the directional analysis given, but we're instructed to only evaluate whether
        equality was stated as the reason for NO, which it wasn't.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its comparative analysis of the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined they had different locations with a specific directional
        difference (east vs west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that the Inmos factory
        is east (not west) of Folly Tower.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as an answer because south-west
        is different from purely west, not because the locations are at the same position.
        It explicitly states Newport is south-west of Pontypool, indicating a difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

        - that South America is generally east of North America, therefore the Cathedral
        cannot be west of the lake
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        The NO answer is given because the church is determined to be east of the
        power plant, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step analysis
        and concludes with an explicit "NO" answer, stating that the church is not

        Instead, it explicitly states that "the Pantheon is east of the Planalto",
        indicating a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer appears
        to contradict the model's own reasoning rather than being based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is inconsistent with its
        reasoning. It states "the statement is true" but then gives "NO" as the final
        answer. Since there is a clear "NO" stated as the final answer, we take that
        as the model's conclusion despite the contradiction.

        therefore it is NOT west of it. This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - instead, it gave NO because Brechin is north of East Coker rather
        than west. The difference in position (being north rather than west) was the
        reason for the NO answer, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, providing geographical reasoning for why one location
        is not west of the other (stating it is north instead)

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal. Instead, it noted a clear directional difference (Scotland is
        north of England) as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a refusal
        or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the values
        were equal - in fact, it explicitly stated there was a slight westward difference
        ("While Scotland is *slightly* west of Somerset"). The NO was given because
        the primary directional difference was north/south rather than west
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that one location is not west of the other

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the locations
        were equal/same - it actually noted there was a westward component (northwest),
        but gave NO because the primary direction was north rather than west. The
        NO was based on directional reasoning, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions. While it noted
        some westward component (northwest), it determined the primary direction was
        north and therefore answered NO to the specific west comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        longitude or are at the same east/west position. Instead, it gave a different
        reason for the NO answer, stating that west/east comparison is irrelevant
        because Scotland is significantly north of England.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after stating
        "Brechin Cathedral is NOT west of St Michael and All Angels' Church." This
        is a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one stadium is "clearly east of"
        the other, indicating a difference in location was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

        further EAST" than the other, indicating a difference in position rather than
        equality. Even though the difference is described as "slight," any stated
        difference means this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations, making this a definitive NO response
        to the comparative question.

        in longitude values (-64.22 vs -64.20) and indicates that Kempes is "further
        west than" Alberdi. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the longitudes and finding that Kempes (-64.22) is further

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it explicitly noted that one stadium is northwest of the other. The
        NO answer was given because northwest is not strictly west, not because the
        locations were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, and this was a clear directional comparison rather than
        a refusal or inability to determine.

        in fact, it explicitly states that Kempes is "northeast of" and "east and
        slightly north of" Alberdi, indicating a difference in location. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        - in fact, it explicitly notes that one stadium is "slightly northeast" of
        the other. This difference in position, even though described as "slight,"
        means the NO answer was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after determining that Estadio Mario Alberto Kempes is slightly northeast
        (and therefore east) of El Gigante de Alberdi.

        includes a westerly component, it is not strictly west") as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, providing a clear comparative answer based
        on its analysis that south-west is not strictly west.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it indicates in step 3 that Crossway Baptist Church
        is "east/southeast of Yan Yean Reservoir", indicating a directional difference.
        The NO answer appears to be because the stated relationship contradicts the
        premise in the question, not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer in step 4, and this NO is given as a direct answer to the positional
        comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        or the same. Instead, it concluded NO based on its reasoning that any "White
        House plantation" would likely be south and east of Maryland, not west. This
        indicates a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, based on its reasoning about relative locations. While
        it acknowledged some uncertainty about the exact plantation location, it still

        never claimed the locations were equal - in fact, it discussed potential differences
        in location but couldn't determine them precisely.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES/NO answer without more information" and indicates it cannot determine
        the relative positions without knowing the precise location of the White House
        plantation. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make

        Church is "slightly southwest" rather than directly west of The Brazen Head.
        This indicates a difference in position (even if slight), not equality. The
        NO is based on this directional difference, not on the locations being the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because it found a directional
        difference (northwest vs west), not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states there is a difference in position, with Haldia being "further south
        and slightly east of Raichak."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same in any way. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the
        reason for its NO answer, explaining that Raichak is north of Haldia and therefore
        cannot be west of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations. This is a clear
        comparative result.

    4248a0dd-75b5-4272-96be-b3dc0a5bb885:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Haldia is "further
        south" and "east of Raichak", indicating different positions. The NO answer
        is given because the relative position is different from what was asked, not
        because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that "Raichak is NOT west of Haldia Energy Power Station."
        This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes that Raichak is "slightly northwest
        of Haldia". The NO answer appears to be given because the location is northwest
        rather than purely west, not because the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, and this appears to be a direct response to whether
        one location is west of the other (not a refusal or inability to determine).

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same in any way. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        Raichak is north of Haldia, not west of it. The model described a specific
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that Dresden (where Hellerau is located) is east of Trieste. This directional
        difference is the reason given for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (one is east of the other). The NO is because the premise of "west
        of" is incorrect, not because the locations are at the same point.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing reasoning that Festspielhaus Hellerau
        is east (not west) of Saint Spyridon Church.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (southwest vs. west), not on equal values. It explicitly states there is a
        difference in position, with Rockbourne being southwest rather than directly
        west of Sutton Coldfield.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after explaining
        that Rockbourne is southwest of Sutton Coldfield, not directly west. This
        is a clear comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that one
        location is southwest of the other rather than directly west - this indicates
        a directional difference, not equality. The model explicitly states "Rockbourne
        is significantly south-west of Sutton Coldfield" and explains that southwest
        is not the same as west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" after determining that while southwest has a westward component,
        it is not directly west.

    e6245ec6-1a07-47ca-ba41-e8d93e36374d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (southwest being different from west), not because the locations are at the
        same position. It explicitly states "Southwest is not directly west" as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear reasoning process leading to that conclusion
        based on the directional comparison (southwest vs west)

    e8bb1e0e-ebb1-4cfe-ae22-30831495a6cf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because it distinguishes between
        "southwest" and "west" positions - it's not stating the locations are equal/same,
        but rather that one is southwest while the question asks about west. Since
        it's noting a directional difference (southwest vs west) rather than equality
        as the reason for NO, this should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment based
        on directional reasoning (southwest vs west)

        (even if slight) rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative directional question, and this NO directly answers whether
        one location is west of the other.

        (Laeken being north of La Monnaie), not because the locations are equal. The
        model explicitly states that Laeken is north of central Brussels where La
        Monnaie is located, indicating a clear positional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on South Korea being
        "significantly east of Bahrain," indicating a clear difference in location
        rather than equal values. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a directional
        explanation that Asan Barrage is not west of Mukawwar Castle because South
        Korea is significantly east of Bahrain.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    72acbed2-2325-4c2f-9a0f-bf21dda777d2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a significant
        difference between the locations ("South Korea is significantly east of Greece"),
        not because the locations are equal. When a difference is noted, even if the
        NO answer might seem counterintuitive, we must classify it as False for equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a definitive NO response to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7fa0466a-a6ae-4339-906b-ee11572eb2ca:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that South Korea is "significantly
        east of Croatia" and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative answer that Asan Barrage is "not west of" Mustafa Castle, with
        a clear final "NO" at the end.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    9b52e4f8-28cd-4463-bdad-78c6a40232b5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Greece is west of South Korea). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about uncertainty or inability
        to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it determined Mustafa Castle
        is west of Asan Barrage (indicating a difference in position), not because
        the locations are at the same longitude. It explicitly states "Bahrain is
        considerably west of South Korea."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as a clear comparative result based on its analysis of relative
        positions.

    b7b93e27-3e4d-4f7a-b6f3-468d54af6848:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Asan Barrage is east of Mustafa Castle,
        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO is
        because the relationship is opposite to what was presumably asked (if one
        was west of the other).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Asan Barrage is east of Mustafa Castle, not west. This
        is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e4a2506e-b5bb-4eeb-9566-d69339e5d923:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Israel (where Mustafa Castle is) was described as being "significantly west"
        of South Korea (where Asan Barrage is), indicating a clear difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining that Asan Barrage cannot be west of Mustafa
        Castle because Israel is west of South Korea.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e5e9cb94-6365-414a-ac69-cc0edfe7b6fd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (South Korea being "significantly east of Israel"), not on the locations being
        equal or the same. The model explicitly notes a directional difference rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear directional reasoning provided (Asan
        Barrage is not west of Mustafa Castle because South Korea is east of Israel)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f51c32d9-5287-4065-a2f8-eaa251eb4436:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (Israel being "significantly west of South Korea"), not on the locations being
        equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after explaining that Israel (where Mustafa Castle is) is west of South
        Korea (where Asan Barrage is), not the other way around.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fd507f4d-5ee7-40f0-a217-980a29d109cb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states that Mustafa
        Castle is west of Asan Barrage, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        answer was given because the direction is opposite to what was asked (Mustafa
        Castle is west of Asan Barrage, not Asan Barrage west of Mustafa Castle).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        explanation and once as a standalone answer. This is a clear comparative NO
        answer based on its reasoning that Mustafa Castle is west of Asan Barrage
        (rather than the other way around).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        location is north of the other, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states "75 Rockefeller Plaza is north, not west, of Holy Trinity Church" as
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the locations and determining that 75 Rockefeller
        Plaza is north, not west, of Holy Trinity Church.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after analyzing
        the east-west positions of the two locations, determining that 6th Avenue
        (where 75 Rockefeller Plaza is located) is west of Broadway (where Holy Trinity
        Church is located).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (northwest vs west), not because the locations are at the same position. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference, with one location
        being northwest of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that one location is northwest (not simply
        west) of the other.

        indicating that Tamil Nadu (where Aliyar Reservoir is) is east of Kerala (where
        Idukki Dam is), implying a difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out its reasoning about the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it concluded NO based on finding that one location
        was likely to the east of the other. The model indicated a directional difference
        ("likely to the east"), so even though it used the word "likely," any stated
        difference means this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning about the relative positions
        of the locations.
