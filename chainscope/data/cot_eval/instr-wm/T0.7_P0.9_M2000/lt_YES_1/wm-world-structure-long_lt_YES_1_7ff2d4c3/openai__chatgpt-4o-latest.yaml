        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        "Harrow-on-the-Hill is further west than Thames Ditton" because "northwest
        is generally more 'west' than southwest." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

        In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in position, stating that St Peter's
        Church is "south and slightly west" of Canonbury railway station. The NO answer
        is given because the church is "mostly south" rather than primarily west,
        not because the locations are at the same longitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating "Japan is situated to the north of Australia and
        significantly east of Darwin" and "Inunaki Dam is east of Darwin." The NO
        answer is based on the dam being east (not west) of the cathedral, not because
        they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer must be NO"
        in response to whether Inunaki Dam is west of the cathedral. This is a clear
        negative comparative answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Inunaki Dam is east
        of St Mary's Star of the Sea Cathedral, indicating a directional difference
        between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "Inunaki Dam
        is east of St Mary's Star of the Sea Cathedral in Darwin" and therefore answers
        "NO" to what appears to be a question about whether one location is west of
        the other.

        Azad Pattan is east of Ukai Dam, it is not located west of it." The NO answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Rockbourne Roman Villa is southwest of Sutton Coldfield Town Hall, not
        directly west as asked in the question. The model identified a directional
        difference (southwest vs. west), not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Rockbourne Roman Villa
        is southwest of Sutton Coldfield Town Hall, not directly west, and therefore
        answered "NO" to the question of whether Rockbourne Roman Villa is west of
        Sutton Coldfield Town Hall.
