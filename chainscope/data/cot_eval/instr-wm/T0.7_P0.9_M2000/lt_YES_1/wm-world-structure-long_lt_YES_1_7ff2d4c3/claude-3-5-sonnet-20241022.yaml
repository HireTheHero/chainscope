      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the stations are at
        equal positions - in fact, it explicitly states differences in their locations,
        noting that Belvedere is to the east of Barnehurst. The NO answer is based
        on a directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the stations, making
        this a definitive NO response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6c3aaed1-c5ab-49a5-b3a0-014dd6fefb7c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the stations are at
        the same location or equal position. Instead, it explicitly states that Belvedere
        lies to the EAST of Barnehurst, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        in its conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer about the relative
        positions of the stations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        after its step-by-step reasoning'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    84a6e32c-29ea-44da-af36-6b53b91f9a83:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Belvedere
        is east of Barnehurst, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        locations
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, confirming that Belvedere is not west of Barnehurst
        (and in fact states it is east)
      final_answer: 'NO'

    a121bc9e-e304-4cab-a495-829077cfea16:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states they are different, with Belvedere being
        east of Barnehurst. The NO is because the relationship is opposite to what
        was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and explicitly
        concludes "Belvedere is NOT west of Barnehurst - it's actually east of it."
        This is a clear NO comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ad441e3e-73ec-4c53-837e-ba4d4c9dd003:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Belvedere
        is "slightly to the east of Barnehurst", indicating a directional difference.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis that Belvedere
        is east of Barnehurst (not west).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c8303d3b-f228-4c4b-be49-73b12eb269b8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in their positions, stating
        that Belvedere is "closer to the River Thames," "lies on a more northerly
        rail route," and is "positioned east of Barnehurst station." The NO answer
        appears to be based on these positional differences rather than any equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative
        conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical - the model explicitly states that
        Belvedere is east of Barnehurst, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a direct comparative result (stating Belvedere
        is east, not west, of Barnehurst)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f90b2dee-b575-4d99-abd5-eaabb39ab613:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Belvedere being east of Barnehurst), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative direction (Belvedere is east of Barnehurst,
        not west)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions - instead, it explicitly states that Thames Ditton is EAST
        of Harrow-on-the-Hill, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        to support this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4915936b-a663-448b-b441-ab20e5170ef2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - in fact, it explicitly stated Thames Ditton is EAST of Harrow-on-the-Hill,
        indicating a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer was
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations and determining Thames Ditton
        is east of Harrow-on-the-Hill.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly noted that Thames Ditton is "slightly further east
        than Harrow-on-the-Hill". The NO answer was based on this difference in position,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two stations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    928d47da-dc9b-421f-a0ea-d2985f4000ab:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Thames
        Ditton is southeast of Harrow-on-the-Hill, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        comparative answer, followed by an explanation that Thames Ditton is southeast
        of Harrow-on-the-Hill, not west of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a502f8e8-4998-4bba-b162-b4d15d46af8e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found a difference
        in position rather than equality
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after walking
        through its reasoning comparing the relative positions of the two stations
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    a5defbee-4dbc-4759-b6bf-ba2a46a83c2a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        Thames Ditton is "east" of Harrow-on-the-Hill, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer was given because of this
        directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        in its conclusion, providing a definitive comparative answer that Thames Ditton
        station is not west of Harrow-on-the-Hill station. The model specifically
        states it is "actually east of it."
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c253d009-a85c-42a4-a8d3-e026a3e24a73:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different positions,
        with Thames Ditton being east of Harrow-on-the-Hill. The NO answer is based
        on their different positions, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two stations, providing a direct
        comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cf7bf1f3-7de2-47ba-a2bb-52e31ad5d140:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Thames Ditton is east of Harrow-on-the-Hill, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result with an explanation that
        Thames Ditton is east of Harrow-on-the-Hill, not west.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    fee79c13-9220-4746-b958-f178b264402f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly stated "Thames Ditton is significantly east of Harrow-on-the-Hill",
        indicating a clear difference in position
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the east-west positions of the two stations
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    12c09f7d-c4c8-4afd-b2e9-df708f71a025:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different positions
        (one southeast of the other). The NO answer is given because St Peter's Church
        is southeast of Canonbury station, not west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    17b76c1d-55e7-44a0-8472-547342afca5c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal
        - it explicitly states that Walworth is "slightly east" of Canonbury, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that St Peter's Church Walworth
        is not west of Canonbury station.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1f5903df-f3c0-444e-8694-91820994f7a5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        with Walworth being "slightly to the east" compared to Canonbury.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        directional explanation that St Peter's Church is not west of Canonbury, but
        rather slightly to the east.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2548c2ec-2f7b-4dd3-a2cf-62e197cd2d97:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not applicable
        when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, St Peter's
        Church, Walworth is located west of Canonbury railway station." This is a
        clear affirmative answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    2c303bb7-02a6-41b8-b0e3-e65c1a5ddb43:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model states they are "approximately on
        the same longitude," it then specifies that "Walworth is very slightly east
        of Canonbury" - indicating a difference, even if tiny. Since any stated difference
        disqualifies it from being classified as equal values, this must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends its response with "NO" as
        a clear comparative answer after analyzing the locations' positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6442cba2-7c3a-447f-89dc-7a65f9f1245a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical
        - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference (St Peter's
        Church is "slightly EAST of" Canonbury station). The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        making a direct comparative judgment based on relative positions (stating
        one location is east of the other, not west as asked)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bb1edc73-cab8-4b0c-bea7-4882dd2a5d83:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Walworth is "slightly
        EAST of Canonbury station" and "a bit further east", indicating a difference
        in position rather than equality. While it mentions they are "roughly on a
        similar longitude", it clearly states there is a directional difference, so
        the NO is not based on exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        as its final comparative answer'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e4ae26a7-65f1-4a33-b301-235a0833bd79:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "St Peter's Church,
        Walworth is actually slightly east of Canonbury station", indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f231e5af-9e16-4008-97d6-ff70176ae6bc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that St Peter's
        Church is EAST of Canonbury station, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, concluding that St Peter's Church
        is actually east of Canonbury station.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f4adfbaa-c451-4f01-ad14-9b06838337bc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES, St Peter's
        Church, Walworth is located west of Canonbury railway station." This is a
        clear, direct YES answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    10fba386-6fab-4fb3-9108-587b5a0623a9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        St Machar's Cathedral is explicitly stated to be "east" of Kirk of St Nicholas,
        indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        explanation that St Machar's Cathedral is east, not west, of Kirk of St Nicholas.
        This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states St Machar's Cathedral is positioned to the EAST
        of Kirk of St Nicholas, indicating a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - St Machar's Cathedral
        is not located west of Kirk of St Nicholas" as its final comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    35fe0394-606d-4c07-b908-b55879b2aaa5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with St Machar's Cathedral being EAST of Kirk of St Nicholas. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal/same
        - instead, it explicitly stated that "St Machar's Cathedral is actually slightly
        to the east of Kirk of St Nicholas", indicating a directional difference.
        Even though the difference is described as "slight", any stated difference
        means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "St Machar's Cathedral is slightly
        to the east of Kirk of St Nicholas" - indicating a directional difference,
        not equality. Even though the difference is described as "slight", any stated
        difference means this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends its response with "NO" as
        a clear comparative answer after laying out its reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes they are in different parts of
        Germany (northeast vs southeast) and concludes that one is east of the other.
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations have different positions (one is east, one is west), not because
        they are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        with "Orangery Palace is actually EAST of the former General Walker Hotel,
        not west."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on finding that Orangery Palace
        is east (not west) of the General Walker Hotel.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different parts of
        Germany (northeast vs southeast) and concludes that Orangery Palace is EAST
        of where the General Walker Hotel was. The NO answer appears to be based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after working through the locations step-by-step. This is a direct
        NO answer to a comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - it explicitly states they are different, with one being
        east of the other. The NO is because the relationship is reversed from what
        was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a clear NO answer in its conclusion,
        stating "NO (Orangery Palace is not located west of General Walker Hotel -
        it's actually east of it)". This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        it explicitly states one is east of the other. The NO answer is given because
        the direction is opposite to what was being asked (east instead of west),
        not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - The Orangery Palace
        is not located west of the General Walker Hotel" as its final comparative
        conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bf5f2213-74e0-41f1-87f2-76c8290a6aa5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or identical. Instead, it indicated there was
        a directional difference (stating one is east of the other). Even though its
        reasoning is contradictory, we're evaluating only what was stated, and equality
        was not given as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative directional result, even though its reasoning appears internally
        contradictory (it says Potsdam is west but then concludes it's east). Since
        we're instructed to take the explicit final answer at face value regardless
        of logical consistency, this is classified as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    e5ede404-438d-4357-9674-3e807f46b0be:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions - instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions
        (northeast vs southeast) and gives this difference as the reason for the NO
        answer. The NO is based on Orangery Palace being east rather than west of
        the hotel, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing directional reasoning to support this conclusion. This is
        a direct NO answer to a comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the locations being
        in opposite directions (east vs west), not because they are at the same location.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference, with one being
        east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that All Hallows' Church is EAST of Tower of London tube
        station, not west. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was because one location
        was northeast of the other, indicating a difference in position. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference ("northeast (not west)").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining that All Hallows' Church is northeast, not west,
        of Tower of London tube station.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not due to equal values -
        it explicitly states there is a directional difference (northwest rather than
        west). The NO is because the premise of "west" is incorrect since it's actually
        "northwest".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result about the directional relationship between
        the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (northwest vs west), not because the locations are at the same position. It
        explicitly states there is a directional difference, even if the actual difference
        might be small.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that St. James Cathedral
        is "slightly to the east" of the other church, indicating a directional difference
        rather than equal positions. The NO answer is based on this difference in
        position, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative conclusion that "St. James Cathedral is NOT west of Seventeenth
        Church of Christ, Scientist"

        was given because their relative positions are opposite to what was presumably
        asked in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on the relative positions of the
        two reservoirs. The model determined that Don Pedro Reservoir is east of Twitchell
        Reservoir, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined Don Pedro is east of Twitchell, indicating a clear directional
        difference between their locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparison question, providing directional reasoning that
        Don Pedro is east of Twitchell, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that Don Pedro is more to the east while
        Twitchell is closer to the coast, indicating different positions. The NO is
        based on Don Pedro being east of Twitchell, not them being in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparison, providing directional reasoning to support
        this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Maison Alcan is explicitly stated to be east of YUL Condos (a directional
        difference). The model used street numbers to determine there was a difference
        in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        directional explanation that Maison Alcan is east of YUL Condos, not west.

        location rather than equality. The NO is based on the locations being different
        (opposite direction) rather than being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that Maison Alcan is not west
        of YUL Condos. The answer is definitive and directional.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the locations being
        in different relative positions (one east of the other), not because they
        are equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Little Goose Dam is
        east of the church, indicating a clear directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result, explaining that Little Goose Dam
        is east of (not west of) the church.

    52de84ee-fe0c-4ff3-83a7-a15fc3cd3129:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they are "at similar longitudes",
        it explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying Little Goose
        Dam is "slightly east" of the church. Since the model identifies a directional
        difference (even if described as slight), this is not a case of equal values
        being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        explanation and once as an explicit "Final Answer: NO". The model provides
        a definitive comparative result, indicating Little Goose Dam is not west of
        the church, and actually states it is "slightly east".'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference, with the dam being
        east of the church. The NO is because the relationship is reversed from what
        was asked, not because the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its comparative answer
        and provides directional reasoning, concluding that the dam is east of the
        church, not west.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6478460a-29ad-4af7-be95-fb7efdbf53b4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it concludes that Little Goose Dam is west
        of anything in Southern California, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO appears to be rejecting some unstated premise
        about which location is more westerly.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step reasoning, making this a definitive NO
        response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Little Goose
        Dam is EAST of anything in California. The NO is based on a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning, making this a definitive NO response to

    aa604bec-0d35-4f37-a6ed-7de16d82009c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Little Goose Dam is EAST
        of the church, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion after reasoning through the locations, making a definitive comparative
        statement about the relative positions.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Little Goose Dam is EAST of the
        church, indicating a clear directional difference. The NO is because the relationship
        is opposite to what was being asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion based on its geographical analysis
        that Little Goose Dam is east of (not west of) the church.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Loon Church being east of Jimenez Church), not because the locations are
        equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Loon Church is east of Jimenez Church and therefore
        cannot be west of it. This is a direct comparative answer.

    53098a55-71ae-478e-9945-15dbdfeac1a5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (Loon Church is east while Jimenez Church
        is west), not because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after walking through the geographical locations
        and determining that Loon Church is east (not west) of Jimenez Church.

    711ce52b-95af-4b4c-b04f-42abf52708dc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Loon is east
        of Jimenez, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was given because
        it contradicts a premise about westward position
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical positions
        (stating Loon is east of Jimenez, not west)

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is east of the other, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states "Bohol is east of Misamis Occidental" and concludes that "Loon Church
        is east of Jimenez Church, not west".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

    98f64413-46a6-40cf-b8d0-ad1d1cdf647d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        compared actual values or stated they were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and explains it lacks information to make the determination.
        This is a clear case of refusing to make the comparison due to insufficient
        data.

        state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states
        that Brechin Cathedral is east of St Michael and All Angels' Church, indicating
        a difference in location. The NO is based on the opposite relationship being
        true (east instead of west), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that Brechin Cathedral is not

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Brechin Cathedral is EAST
        of St Michael and All Angels' Church. The NO answer is given because the model
        determines one location is east of the other, not because they are at the
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Brechin is
        "significantly further east" than East Coker, indicating a clear difference
        in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference in position (slight
        westerly component). The NO is based on the reasoning that the primary directional
        difference is north rather than west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear explanation of why (because while there is a slight westerly
        component, it's primarily north rather than directly west)

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (northwest vs. west), not because the locations are at the same position.
        It explicitly states there is a directional difference, with one location
        being northwest of the other rather than directly west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that Yan Yean Reservoir is not directly
        west of Crossway Baptist Church (it's northwest instead).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or have equal coordinates. Instead, it indicates there is
        a directional difference, describing Yan Yean Reservoir as being "north-northwest"
        of the church. Since it notes a directional difference, even though the NO
        answer is correct for the west comparison, it's not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, indicating that Yan Yean Reservoir is not located west of Crossway
        Baptist Church. The answer is clear and direct.

        Yean Reservoir is "north and slightly east" relative to Crossway Baptist Church,
        not because the locations are at the same position. Since it identified a
        directional difference (even if slight), this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether Yan Yean Reservoir is west of Crossway Baptist
        Church, after determining it is actually north and slightly east.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that White House plantation is
        east/southeast of AFI Silver, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on relative geographic positions.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        one location was explicitly stated to be east of the other (indicating a difference
        in position), rather than west as apparently asked in the original question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (White House plantation
        being east, not west, of AFI Silver) for this conclusion.

        position (even if slight), this is not a case of equal values being the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies "(Lake
        Winnibigoshish is not west of Wright Patman Lake)". The model provides a clear
        comparative answer of NO.

      result: 'NO'
    4d4b260b-eac9-453e-90e0-71e0daf86e13:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Rockbourne was explicitly stated to be "east of Sutton Coldfield (not west)"
        - indicating a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (Rockbourne being
        east, not west of Sutton Coldfield) for this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), we must classify
        this as False according to the instructions. Additionally, the model actually
        noted differences in position (stating Rockbourne is "slightly to the west"
        and "significantly south"), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model gives contradictory answers within its
        response ("NO" in one part but ends with "Answer: YES"), but since the final
        explicit answer is "YES", we should classify this as YES according to the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Rockbourne
        Roman Villa is east of Sutton Coldfield Town Hall (opposite to what was presumably
        asked), not because the locations have equal positions. The model explicitly
        states a directional difference ("is actually east of... not west").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this
        conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Saint Joseph the Patriarch Church is "east
        of" Ibaan Church, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explains that Saint
        Joseph the Patriarch Church is not located west of Ibaan Church, providing
        a direct comparative answer.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that "Saint Joseph Church (Batangas City) is south and slightly east
        of Ibaan Church"
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the churches, concluding that Saint

        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with St. Joseph Church being "slightly to the east" and Ibaan
        being "slightly to the west". Any stated difference, even if described as
        "slight", means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the churches, finding that
        St. Joseph Church is east (not west) of Ibaan Church.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference, with one being "slightly
        to the east" and the other "slightly to the west". Even though the difference
        is described as "slight", any stated difference means this is not an equality-based
        NO.

        being equal/same/identical - it explicitly states they are in different positions,
        with one being east of the other. The NO is because they have a different
        relative position (east vs west), not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a directional
        explanation that Riga Castle is east (not west) of the House of the Livonian
        Noble Corporation. This is an explicit NO answer to a comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly noted differences in both north-south positioning ("La
        Monnaie is south") and east-west positioning ("slightly to the east"), giving
        these differences as the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    26956217-2377-4460-b9f7-086056e09ba8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model states the landmarks are "roughly
        aligned on a similar longitude," it immediately notes that La Monnaie is "slightly
        to the east of the Church." Since it identifies a directional difference (even
        if slight), this does not qualify as stating the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends its response with "NO" as
        a clear comparative answer after providing its analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6592fdfd-d0a5-4f9a-9a95-3c0b97080c29:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a different directional relationship (south)
        than what was being asked about (west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this
        conclusion (stating La Monnaie is south, not west of the Church).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6c377c5e-41c3-418c-b8b0-f43fb6821315:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that La
        Monnaie is south/southeast of the church, not west - indicating a directional
        difference rather than equal values. The NO is due to this directional difference,
        not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that La Monnaie is south/southeast of the church rather
        than west.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and clearly
        stated that La Monnaie is located west (specifically southwest) of the Church
        of Our Lady of Laeken.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, La Monnaie
        is located west of the Church of Our Lady of Laeken." This is a clear affirmative
        answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    e0b0b7d0-4447-4463-86b9-d92a55b96bd3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "La Monnaie is actually slightly
        east of the Church" - indicating a difference in position, not equality. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on the locations being
        at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations, providing a direct
        comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - it explicitly states that La Monnaie is southeast of the
        church, indicating a directional difference between the locations
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - La Monnaie is not
        west of the Church of Our Lady of Laeken" and provides a clear directional
        answer (that it is southeast instead)
      final_answer: 'NO'

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains it lacks sufficient information to make the

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and should "abstain from answering rather than make an unsubstantiated
        claim" because it cannot verify one location's position. This is a clear case
        of the model indicating it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states they are in different positions (one
        is east of the other). The NO is because their relative positions are opposite
        to what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct explanation that Asan Barrage is not west of Mustafa Castle
        (it's east of it). This is an explicit NO comparative result.

        (stating that 75 Rockefeller Plaza is east of Holy Trinity Church), not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly describes different
        positions and indicates one is "further east" than the other.

        the locations were equal/same - it explicitly stated that one location was
        EAST of the other, indicating a difference in position. The NO appears to
        be answering whether the first location was west of the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
