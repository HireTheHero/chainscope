    06d39faf-eabe-4e25-8094-2fb8b92e6825:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the stations
        being at the same location. Instead, it explicitly states that Belvedere is
        located to the east of Barnehurst, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that "Belvedere railway station is not located west
        of Barnehurst railway station." This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    0ff2c4b1-2618-4b4e-ac08-55cbc08d4395:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the stations are at
        the same location. In fact, it explicitly states that Belvedere is "to the
        north and slightly to the west of Barnehurst." The NO answer is given because
        the model concludes Belvedere is east of Barnehurst, not because the locations
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Belvedere is west of Barnehurst. The answer is explicit and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the stations are in the same location. The model explicitly states that Belvedere
        is to the east of Barnehurst, indicating a clear directional difference between
        their locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Belvedere is west of Barnehurst, and provides a specific
        directional relationship (Belvedere is to the east of Barnehurst).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    347144d9-0ff5-4f41-95ac-e7d9f23f92b8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the stations are at
        the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it explains that Belvedere
        is north of Barnehurst, and bases its NO answer on their relative positions,
        not on them being equal/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion, providing a direct comparative
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the stations are at
        the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly states
        that Belvedere is east of Barnehurst, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Belvedere railway station
        is not located west of Barnehurst railway station; it is located to the east."
        This is an explicit NO answer with a clear comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7883e3cb-cc5d-4f07-9a22-8da2e1cebdc2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer, but not because
        the stations are in the same location. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Belvedere is to the east of Barnehurst, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explicitly concludes
        "Belvedere railway station is not located west of Barnehurst railway station."
        This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8f35aed1-a7c0-46f5-b85f-6e8475ad87ed:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        stations are in the same location. The model explicitly states that Belvedere
        is east of Barnehurst, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not because of equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Belvedere railway station
        is not located west of Barnehurst railway station" and explains that Belvedere
        is east of Barnehurst. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a731a21b-334c-4a45-9476-bbc1be84bdb2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (Belvedere being north of Barnehurst) rather than the locations being equal/identical.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference, with one station
        being north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical analysis showing
        Belvedere is north of, not west of, Barnehurst.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    de78958c-e469-45a1-bbcb-5390cbf42ed8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the stations
        are in the same location. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference - Belvedere is to the east of Barnehurst. The NO is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Belvedere railway station
        is not located west of Barnehurst railway station" and provides a definitive
        comparative result, explaining that Belvedere is east of Barnehurst.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ebbc0e1e-db49-4107-a5c8-a132b7232926:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the stations are in the same location. The model explicitly states that Barnehurst
        is northwest of Belvedere (indicating different locations), and the NO is
        based on Belvedere being east of Barnehurst, not because they are at the same
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final comparative answer, based on finding that Belvedere is east
        of Barnehurst (not west).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons made in the
        response
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: YES" after its step-by-step analysis'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    22937326-acd6-488f-8a51-080981fad92e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the stations are at
        the same longitude or equally west. Instead, it describes them as being in
        different positions, with Thames Ditton being "south and slightly to the west"
        compared to Harrow-on-the-Hill. The NO answer is based on their relative positions
        being different, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        after explaining its reasoning about the relative positions of the stations.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2746e6d5-253f-48bf-ab17-18fac38d565d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The model actually found a difference in
        longitude (-0.340 vs -0.333) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" after analyzing the locations and determining that Thames Ditton is
        slightly further west than Harrow-on-the-Hill.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    2f5b4810-abd5-4a9a-82f6-f0ea71fc1014:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it states that Thames Ditton
        is east of Harrow-on-the-Hill, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Thames
        Ditton railway station is not located west of Harrow-on-the-Hill station"
        as its final comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    588811f2-893b-4ca8-98d1-571166b84d71:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the stations are at
        the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it indicates there is
        a directional difference, specifically noting that Thames Ditton is "south-west"
        relative to Harrow-on-the-Hill. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the relative locations of the
        stations. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.'

    58e30433-adc1-4635-97f3-5566efb99027:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the stations are at equal
        positions. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying Thames Ditton is "more to the south and slightly east" compared to
        Harrow-on-the-Hill. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the stations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8778791c-69a0-426e-8989-6c1631bec1d0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the stations are at
        the same longitude. Instead, it indicates there is a directional difference,
        describing Thames Ditton as being "south and slightly to the west" compared
        to Harrow-on-the-Hill. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional
        relationship rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Thames Ditton
        railway station is not located west of Harrow-on-the-Hill station" as a clear
        comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bc46e1df-ea61-4db0-9994-5024526cb1a5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Thames Ditton is "east of
        Harrow-on-the-Hill" and gives this directional difference as the reason for
        its NO answer. Even if the difference might be small, any stated directional
        difference means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Thames Ditton railway
        station is not located west of Harrow-on-the-Hill station" as its final conclusion.
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the stations are at the same location. The model explicitly states that Thames
        Ditton is "slightly to the east of Harrow-on-the-Hill," indicating a difference
        in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO. Thames Ditton railway
        station is not located west of Harrow-on-the-Hill station" as its final answer,
        and explains that Thames Ditton is actually slightly to the east of Harrow-on-the-Hill.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e52dbb2b-9ef1-4cd0-af86-cc421c67b6b5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the classification criteria. The equal values criteria
        only apply when evaluating NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is:
        YES" after its step-by-step analysis, making this a clear YES answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Walworth is "generally to the southeast of Canonbury," indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        end of its response, after explaining that St Peter's Church is actually southeast
        of Canonbury station, not west of it.

      result: 'NO'
    3a3a5b59-5c66-480f-b8a9-db1c1a1ed32e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its determination
        that St Peter's Church is southeast of Canonbury station, not because the
        locations are equal/identical. The model explicitly states a directional difference
        (southeast vs north), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, St Peter's
        Church, Walworth is not located west of Canonbury railway station" as its
        final answer. This is a direct comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude. Instead, it indicates there are directional differences,
        describing St Peter's Church as being "south and slightly west" of Canonbury
        station. The NO answer appears to be given because the primary directional
        difference is south-north rather than west-east, not because the locations
        are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        regarding whether St Peter's Church is west of Canonbury station. The answer
        is clearly stated and is a direct response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (south vs. north), not on the locations being equal/identical. The model explicitly
        states that Walworth is south of Canonbury, indicating different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative directional assessment that St Peter's Church
        is not west of Canonbury station.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (with St Peter's Church being southeast
        of Canonbury station), not because they are in the same location. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" as its

        (one is north of the other). The fact that the difference is in a different
        direction than asked about (north vs west) doesn't change that the model identified
        a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, based on finding that St Machar's Cathedral
        is north rather than west of the Kirk of St Nicholas.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (north vs. center), not because the locations are equal or the
        same. The model explicitly states that one location is north of the other,
        indicating a clear positional difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion, based on its analysis that St Machar's Cathedral
        is to the north (not west) of the Kirk of St Nicholas.

        slightly east of the Kirk of St Nicholas," indicating a difference in position,
        even if slight. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the NO was given because the model
        determined there was a specific directional difference (north vs west). The
        model explicitly states that St Machar's Cathedral is north of the Kirk of
        St Nicholas, indicating different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer based on its analysis
        of the locations. The NO is given because St Machar's Cathedral is described
        as being north (not west) of the Kirk of St Nicholas.

        The Grandview is south of the Cathedral along the same north-south axis (Las
        Vegas Blvd), rather than west of it. Since the NO is based on directional
        difference rather than equality, this is False.

        direction rather than east-west, but does not explicitly state they are at
        the same longitude or exactly equal in east-west position. The NO answer is
        based on their relative positions being primarily different in north-south
        direction, not on them being equal in east-west position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it states that both are on the eastern side of Las Vegas
        Boulevard, but concludes NO because The Grandview is south rather than west
        of the Cathedral. The NO answer is based on directional difference (south
        vs. desired west), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion after analyzing the locations. This is a clear NO comparative

        are equal/same - it explicitly states that the Orangery Palace is east of
        the General Walker Hotel, indicating a clear directional difference between
        their locations. The NO is because the premise (being west) is incorrect,
        not because the locations are the same.

        Orangery Palace is "north-northwest" of the General Walker Hotel, indicating
        a different relative position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        Orangery Palace is "north and slightly to the east" of the General Walker
        Hotel, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The
        NO answer was given because the model determined one location was east of
        the other, not because they were at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis. The model confidently determines that the Orangery Palace is not
        west of the General Walker Hotel (stating it is actually "north and slightly

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically states that Bath Abbey is "to the northwest
        of St John's Church" and gives directional differences, indicating the NO
        answer is based on directional difference rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Bath Abbey
        is not located west of St John's Church, Bath." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    36ec36ab-38fe-497e-9bb9-05f871ce382f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because Bath Abbey
        is east of St John's Church, not because they are in the same location. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Bath Abbey is
        situated in the central part of Bath and St John's Church is positioned to
        the west of the city center, Bath Abbey would be east of St John's Church").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Bath Abbey is west of St John's Church. This is a
        direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly describes different positions, stating that St John's
        Church is southwest of Bath Abbey, meaning Bath Abbey is east of St John's
        Church. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Bath Abbey is not located
        west of St John's Church" as its final comparative answer. This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparison question.

    5ec9484a-1ad0-4c9f-8529-07d066a93581:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Rather, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference - that St John's Church is west of Bath
        Abbey (and thus Bath Abbey is east of St John's Church). This directional
        difference, not equality, is given as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its geographic
        analysis that Bath Abbey is east of St John's Church, not west of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        Church, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Bath Abbey is not
        located west of St John's Church, Bath" as its final comparative conclusion.
        This is a clear NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically states that "Bath Abbey is situated
        to the north and slightly east of St John's Church." The NO answer is based
        on a directional difference (being east rather than west), not on equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes "Bath Abbey is not west of St John's Church." This
        is a direct comparative answer to the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    955bafdf-f8df-46c7-9c63-2dbebd0019c0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values/locations
        - it explicitly states the locations are different (one north of the other)
        and uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (north vs west)
        for this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it states that Bath Abbey is north of
        St John's Church, indicating a different directional relationship rather than
        equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer about the westward
        positioning. The NO is based on finding a different directional relationship
        (north) rather than being unable to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this question
        is automatically False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        doesn't come into play since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        even though this contradicts its earlier statement about the relative positions
        being northeast. Since we're instructed to focus on the explicit final answer
        regardless of contradictions, the answer is YES.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one location is
        "north and slightly east" of the other, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Tuanku Jaafar Power Station
        is "actually east of the Xayaburi Dam," indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Tuanku
        Jaafar Power Station is not located west of Xayaburi Dam" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        \ in longitude (101.8\xB0E vs 101.7\xB0E) and indicates that one location\
        \ is \"slightly east\" of the other. Even though the difference is small,\
        \ any stated difference means the NO answer was not due to equal values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question is NO" after determining that the Tuanku Jaafar Power Station
        is east (not west) of the Xayaburi Dam based on longitude comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate that the locations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that St. James Cathedral
        is "further east" than the Seventeenth Church of Christ, Scientist, based
        on their street numbers (65 E. vs 55 E.). The NO answer is given because of
        this difference in position, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with "NO" explicitly written at the end of the response. The model provides
        a clear comparative conclusion that St. James Cathedral is not located west

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that St. James Cathedral is "further east" than the other church, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO is based on the opposite directional relationship
        than what was asked (east instead of west), not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning about relative positions
        (one being east of the other, not west)

        in fact, it explicitly found a difference in their positions, noting that
        "65 E (Huron St) is numerically greater than 55 E (Wacker Dr)" and concluded
        that "St. James Cathedral is located further east." Since it found a difference
        rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Based on this
        reasoning, the answer to the question is: NO" after comparing the east-west

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not because the locations
        are equal/same/identical - it explicitly states that Tribeca Belfast is located
        to the east of St Anne's Cathedral, indicating a directional difference. The
        NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations,
        where it determined that Tribeca Belfast is east (not west) of St Anne's Cathedral.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically indicates that Tribeca Belfast is "located
        to the north and northeast of St Anne's Cathedral" - indicating a directional
        difference, not equality. The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Tribeca Belfast is
        not located west of St Anne's Cathedral" as its final comparative conclusion.
        This is a clear NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Rather, the model indicates that Tribeca
        Belfast is "north and northeast" of the Cathedral, giving a directional difference
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" and
        clearly indicates that Tribeca Belfast is not located west of St Anne's Cathedral,
        making this a definitive NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/identical/the
        same. Instead, it explains that Tribeca Belfast is "surrounding or nearby"
        and "part of the surrounding area" - indicating a different spatial relationship
        rather than equality of position as the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" and
        provides a clear comparative conclusion that "Tribeca Belfast is not located
        west of St Anne's Cathedral"

    6ab5510d-0298-4a7c-8733-ae81c4c4d0b8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or identical. Instead, it suggests that Tribeca is "beside or
        encompassing areas around the Cathedral" rather than being "significantly
        west." This indicates a spatial relationship that is different from west,
        not equal positions. The NO is based on rejecting the western positioning,
        not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after its analysis, making this a clear NO response. While the model
        expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a definitive
        NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Tribeca is north of St Anne's
        Cathedral, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference (being north rather than west), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its analysis of the relative positions.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Tribeca Belfast is explicitly stated to be "northeast of St Anne's Cathedral"
        - indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer to the question is NO" after determining that Tribeca Belfast is
        northeast (not west) of St Anne's Cathedral.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Tribeca Belfast is "to the north and east of St Anne's Cathedral" - indicating
        a different relative position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing a clear directional assessment that Tribeca Belfast is not
        located west of St Anne's Cathedral. The model indicates it is actually "to
        the north and east" instead.

        being equal/same - instead, it explicitly states that the Cathedral is south
        of the Performing Arts Center, indicating a different relative position. The
        NO is based on directional difference (south vs west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" as

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Dilkusha Kothi is southeast of Vidhan Bhavan, indicating a directional
        difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a directional explanation that Dilkusha Kothi is southeast of Vidhan
        Bhavan, not west of it. This is a clear comparative NO answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different relative positions (with Chashma being southeast
        of Bala Hissar), not because they are at the same location. The model identifies
        a specific directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Based on
        this reasoning, the answer is NO" as its final conclusion after determining
        that Chashma is southeast of Bala Hissar rather than west.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that Chashma Nuclear
        Power Plant is located east of Bala Hissar (indicating a difference in location),
        which is why it answers NO to whether it's west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Chashma Nuclear Power Plant is located west of Bala
        Hissar, explaining that it is actually located east of Bala Hissar.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Chashma was determined to be south of Bala Hissar rather than west. The model
        identified a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question is NO" after determining that Chashma is south of Bala Hissar
        rather than west of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states they are in different
        positions, with the plant being east of Bala Hissar.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" and provides
        a definitive comparative directional relationship, saying the plant is east
        of Bala Hissar, not west.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        that Chashma Nuclear Power Plant is "south and slightly east" of Bala Hissar,
        not because the locations are equal/same. It explicitly states a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.

        other ("Doha is situated to the east of the United Arab Emirates" and concludes
        "the Church of Our Lady of the Rosary in Doha is located east of the Barakah
        nuclear power plant"). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (church is east of the plant), not because
        they are equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion, after determining that the church is east (not

        The NO is because one location is east of the other, not because they're at
        the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, the Church of Our Lady
        of the Rosary is not located west of the Barakah nuclear power plant" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Hendersonville (where Kanuga
        Conference Center is located) is "north and slightly east of Saluda Lake."
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result about the geographical relationship
        between the two locations. The answer is definitive and based on the model's
        geographical analysis.

    d0df2680-067a-4300-bac4-1c0beef09efd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (northeast vs. southwest), not because
        they are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final comparative conclusion, based on finding that Kanuga Conference
        Center is northeast (not west) of Saluda Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different - specifically that Kanuga Conference Center is east
        of Saluda Lake. The model does not state or suggest the locations are at the
        same longitude. Rather, it identifies a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Thus, the answer to the
        question is NO" after determining that Kanuga Conference Center is east of
        Saluda Lake, not west. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        Instead, it explicitly states that YUL Condos is further west than Maison
        Alcan, indicating a difference in location. The NO answer is based on Maison
        Alcan being east of YUL Condos, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Maison Alcan is not

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Maison Alcan is east of YUL Condos, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer was given because of this directional
        difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Maison Alcan is west of YUL Condos. The model provides
        a direct comparative result, stating that Maison Alcan is east of YUL Condos.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Maison
        Alcan is east of YUL Condos (a directional difference), not because the locations
        are the same. The model explicitly states there is a difference in location
        and provides reasoning based on address numbers indicating different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question is NO" after determining that Maison Alcan is east (not west)
        of YUL Condos. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Maison Alcan
        is not located west of YUL Condos" as a clear comparative statement. This
        is a direct NO answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        it answered NO to whether Maison Alcan is west of YUL Condos.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Maison Alcan is located west of YUL Condos, after
        explaining its reasoning about the relative positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Maison Alcan is
        east of YUL Condos based on street numbering (1188 vs 1400). The NO is due
        to a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Maison Alcan is not
        located west of YUL Condos" as its final answer after comparing the locations.
        This is a clear NO comparative result.

        Reservoir is "actually northeast of Burwood East" - indicating a specific
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Yan Yean Reservoir is not located

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        one location is northwest of the other, indicating a directional difference.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("northwest"
        rather than "west").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative directional result. The model explains that
        Yan Yean Reservoir is northwest (not directly west) of Crossway Baptist Church.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    57cb2662-b067-425c-8dc8-1be8d5ac71c8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with the reservoir being "north-northwest" relative to the church
        rather than west. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Yan Yean
        Reservoir is not located west of Crossway Baptist Church" and provides an
        alternative direction (north-northwest). This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates there is a directional difference, describing
        Yan Yean Reservoir as being "north and slightly northwest" of Crossway Baptist
        Church. Even though this includes a western component, the NO answer is not
        based on equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question about whether Yan Yean Reservoir is located west
        of Crossway Baptist Church.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it states that one location
        is north of the other ("Yan Yean Reservoir is north of Burwood East"), indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "the answer
        is NO" and confirms "Yan Yean Reservoir is not located west of Crossway Baptist
        Church" as its final comparative conclusion.

        locations have different positions (north-northwest vs east), not because
        they are equal or the same. The model identifies a specific directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, determining that Yan Yean Reservoir is "north-northwest"
        rather than strictly west of Crossway Baptist Church.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different locations
        with Yan Yean Reservoir being northwest of Crossway Baptist Church. The NO
        appears to be because the location is northwest rather than purely west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing the locations. The model indicates Yan Yean Reservoir is northwest
        (not purely west) of Crossway Baptist Church.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Kozienice is "further east than" REK Bitola, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer was given because Kozienice is east of (not west
        of) REK Bitola.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Kozienice Power Station is located west of REK Bitola.
        The model provides a step-by-step analysis and concludes with a definitive
        NO, explaining that Kozienice is east of REK Bitola.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically indicates that Kozienice is "to the
        north and slightly to the east of Bitola." The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that Kozienice Power Station is not located west of REK
        Bitola. The answer is definitive and comparative.

        approximately the same longitude\" (around 21\xB0 East), it explicitly states\
        \ that \"Kozienice is slightly to the west of Bitola.\" Since the model indicates\
        \ there is a slight difference in position (not exact equality) and this slight\
        \ westward position is noted, this cannot be classified as equal values being\
        \ the reason for the NO answer."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Kozienice Power Station
        is not significantly west of REK Bitola" as its final conclusion. This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        coordinates or are at the same longitude. Instead, it explains that Kozienice
        is actually further east than REK Bitola, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "No, Kozienice Power
        Station is not located west of REK Bitola." This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        saying "Kozienice (in Poland) is located further east relative to Bitola."
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, specifically stating "Kozienice Power Station is not located
        west of REK Bitola." This is a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that "Kozienice
        (in Poland) is indeed located east of Bitola" - indicating a difference in
        position, not equality. The NO answer was given because Kozienice is east
        (not west) of Bitola.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographical positions of both power stations and determining
        that Kozienice is east of Bitola (not west).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (White House plantation being east of AFI Silver Theatre), not
        because the locations are the same. In fact, it explicitly states they are
        in different positions.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        though it makes assumptions about which White House is being referenced. Since
        it provides a clear YES answer after working through its reasoning, this counts
        as YES.

        locations have different positions (one is south of the other), not because
        they are equal/same. The model explicitly states "the White House Plantation
        is generally south of Silver Spring, Maryland, not west" as the reason for
        its NO answer.

        locations, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead,
        it suggests the plantation would likely be south/southeast rather than west
        of AFI Silver. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning.
        Since it provides a clear directional conclusion rather than stating it cannot
        determine or verify the answer, this counts as a definitive NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference (La Monnaie is "south" rather than "west" of the
        church). The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a directional explanation that La Monnaie is south
        of the church rather than west.

        being equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO is based on the reasoning that
        the locations cannot be compared because they are in different cities. The
        model explicitly states they cannot be "directly compared in a geographic

        locations were equal - it actually stated one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but primarily because
        one location doesn't exist ("54 University Avenue does not exist as a known
