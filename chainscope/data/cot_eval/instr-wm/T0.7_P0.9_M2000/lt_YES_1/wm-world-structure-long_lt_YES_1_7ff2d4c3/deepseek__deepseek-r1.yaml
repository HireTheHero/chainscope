      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this question
        automatically receives a False classification per the instructions. The equal
        values criteria only apply when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        and confirms this with additional explanation about Belvedere being west of

    909fb095-34fa-42ac-a059-1beefee87393:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this automatically results in False according to the classification rules,
        regardless of any discussion of equality in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never actually
        provides a clear YES/NO conclusion about whether Belvedere station is west
        of Barnehurst station. The response ends mid-thought while still trying to
        determine their relative positions. Without a definitive comparative conclusion,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never explicitly stated the locations were equal/identical anyway.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning about the
        railway lines and locations but never actually provides an explicit YES/NO
        answer to whether Belvedere station is west of Barnehurst station. The final
        paragraph suggests Barnehurst would be west of Belvedere (opposite of what
        was asked), but this is not framed as a definitive answer to the original
        question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this question
        automatically receives a False classification per the instructions, regardless
        of any comparisons made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear affirmative statement that "Belvedere railway station is located west
        of Barnehurst railway station," supported by specific longitude coordinates.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    df111d15-4547-4b80-8473-a945c452290c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the stations
        are in the same location. Instead, it explicitly states that Belvedere is
        east of Barnehurst (indicating different positions), with Barnehurst being
        northwest of Belvedere. The NO is because their relative positions are opposite
        to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with clear comparative reasoning about the relative positions of the stations,
        concluding that Belvedere is east of Barnehurst, not west.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    e32dd0a3-e5a9-4fb2-91b9-8c0adbb11897:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The question
        of equal values is not relevant since there was no final NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        never reaches a final conclusion. While there is some discussion of coordinates
        suggesting Belvedere might be west of Barnehurst ("Therefore, the answer would
        be YES"), this is immediately followed by doubt and further analysis ("Wait,
        but wait, I might have mixed up the coordinates"). The response ends without
        making a definitive YES/NO determination.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the incomplete response never indicated the locations had equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly mid-thought without providing
        a final YES/NO conclusion about whether Thames Ditton is west of Harrow-on-the-Hill.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a direct comparison stating the locations were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through its thought process but never
        actually provides a clear YES/NO answer about whether Thames Ditton is west
        of Harrow-on-the-Hill. It only describes their general locations relative
        to London but doesn't make the specific west/east comparison requested.

        never reached a conclusion about equality or inequality of the locations'
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and cuts off
        mid-thought while still analyzing the locations. The model never reaches a
        final YES/NO conclusion about whether Thames Ditton is west of Harrow-on-the-Hill.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - rather, it explicitly states that St Machar's is "directly
        north (not west)" of the Kirk. The model indicates a clear directional difference
        (north vs west), not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" and clearly
        concludes that St Machar''s Cathedral is not west of the Kirk of St Nicholas,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that St Machar's Cathedral
        is north of the Kirk of St Nicholas, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO is because one location is north of the other,
        not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" and clearly
        explains that St Machar''s Cathedral is not west of the Kirk of St Nicholas
        because it is north of it. This is a clear comparative NO answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions,
        with St. Machar's being north of the Kirk of St. Nicholas. The NO answer is
        based on directional difference (north vs west), not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, concluding that St. Machar's Cathedral
        is not west but north of the Kirk of St. Nicholas. This is a direct comparative
        answer to the question.

        never reached a conclusion about equal values or any other comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-thought without providing
        a clear YES/NO conclusion. Throughout the response, it repeatedly considers
        different possibilities and locations but never arrives at a definitive answer
        about whether The Grandview is west of Guardian Angel Cathedral.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        the cathedral is east of the castle (indicating a difference in position),
        and this directional difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO." at the end
        of its response, after explaining that the cathedral is east of the castle.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        - it explicitly states that the cathedral is east of the castle and the castle
        is west of the cathedral. The model does not indicate the locations are the
        same/equal, but rather indicates they are in different positions relative
        to each other.

        are equal - it explicitly states that the cathedral is "southeast of Uppsala
        Castle" and "east (and slightly south) of the castle". Since it indicates
        a directional difference, even though there was uncertainty in the thinking
        process, the final answer shows the positions are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a definitive comparative statement that the cathedral is southeast
        of the castle, not west of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that the cathedral is north of the castle (not
        west), with the castle being positioned to the south of the cathedral on a
        hill called Kasberget. Since it indicates a directional difference (north-south),
        even though the question was about east-west positioning, this is not a case
        of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice - both at the
        end of its thinking process and in its final conclusion. It clearly states
        "Uppsala Cathedral is not located west of Uppsala Castle" as a direct comparative
        answer.

        are equal/same - rather, it states the cathedral is north of the castle (a
        different direction than asked about), indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative explanation that Uppsala Cathedral is north of Uppsala Castle,
        not west.

        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative explanation that the cathedral is east of
        the castle, not west.

        are equal - it explicitly states that the cathedral is east of the castle,
        indicating a clear directional difference between their positions. The model
        explains this difference using the Fyris River as a reference point, with
        the cathedral on the eastern side and the castle on the western side.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        provides a final YES/NO answer. The last sentence is hypothetical ("if the
        longitude of Azad Pattan is west of Ukai's longitude, then the answer would
        be YES") but doesn't make a definitive statement. Earlier, it suggests NO
        based on coordinates but then questions those coordinates multiple times.

        distance of ~150km mentioned), which is the reason for the NO answer. The
        model identifies a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Genadendal Residence is not
        west of Athlone Power Station. The answer is explicitly stated and used as
        a comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with Genadendal being east of Athlone Power Station (approximately
        140 kilometers east of Cape Town). The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a directional explanation supporting this comparative
        result (stating that Genadendal is east, not west, of the power station).

        discusses equal and unequal values at various points but never reaches a final
        NO answer based on equality or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly with "Upon checking," without
        providing a final YES/NO answer. While the model discusses various possibilities
        and contradictions throughout its reasoning, it never arrives at a definitive
        conclusion. The response shows the model struggling with conflicting information
        but doesn't make a final determination.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in the values (65 E vs 55 E) and concludes NO because St. James is actually

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the east-west
        positions of the two churches. The model explains that St. James is east of

      explanation_final_answer: After a long analysis, the model explicitly states
        "YES" when concluding that "St. James would be west of the Seventeenth Church."
        Although it continues to analyze and question this conclusion afterwards,

        position, with St. James being farther east (65 E vs 55 E). The NO answer
        is based on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

        never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but ends
        with uncertainty and an incomplete thought ("Wait, if the address is West
        Wacker,"). While it suggests "NO" at several points in its reasoning, it never
        commits to a final answer, expressing doubt and considering alternatives until
        the very end. The response ends without a clear conclusion.

        are equal - it explicitly states that St. James (65 E) is east of the Seventeenth
        Church (55 E). The model concludes NO because it found a directional difference
        (St. James being further east), not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative answer that St. James Cathedral

    bde1bfb0-e9f1-4cce-afbf-5b91989e7290:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a difference in
        values (65 E vs 55 E), explicitly stating that St. James is "farther east"
        and "more east" than the Seventeenth Church. The NO is not based on the values
        being equal, but rather on one location being explicitly more eastern than
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that St. James Cathedral
        is not west of the Seventeenth Church, but rather east of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a difference
        in positions (65 E vs 55 E), with St. James being further east. The model
        does not state the locations are equal - in fact, it explicitly notes that
        one is further east than the other. The NO is because St. James is east of
        the other church, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" and clearly
        explains that St. James Cathedral is east, not west, of the Seventeenth Church.

        NO answer given earlier, it wasn't because the locations were equal - the
        model suggested Tribeca was east of the Cathedral, not at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "NO, Tribeca is not west of the
        Cathedral" based on its analysis of the street layout, determining that Tribeca
        is actually east of the Cathedral. However, immediately after stating this
        conclusion, the model expresses doubt ("But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I
        have the directions reversed.") and starts to reconsider. The response ends

        Chashma is south-southwest rather than directly west. The NO is not due to
        equal positions but rather due to a different directional relationship than
        what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, providing a definitive comparative answer about

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that San Giovanni is east of Sacro Cuore (specifically southeast vs northeast),
        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is specifically addressing the comparative directional
        relationship (whether one location is west of the other). The model provides
        clear reasoning for this conclusion based on the relative positions of the
        churches.

        that Maison Alcan is EAST of YUL Condos (indicating different positions),
        which is why it's not west of them. The model describes a clear directional
        difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is specifically addressing the comparative directional

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        - it explicitly states that "Maison Alcan lies east of 901 Rue Saint-Jacques
        (YUL Condos)". The NO is not because the locations are equal/same, but because
        one is east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after working through the locations and concluding that Maison Alcan lies
        east of YUL Condos. The answer is clearly stated and provides a comparative
        result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        Tianjin tower is east and south of the Great Wall, not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("lies
        east and south of the Great Wall"), so this is not a case of equal values.

        The NO answer is based on directional differences, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a direct comparative assessment that the Tianjin Modern
        City Office Tower is not west of the Great Wall of China. The answer is explicit
        and definitive.

        tower is located) is east of the Great Wall sections near Beijing. The model
        describes a directional difference, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice - once after
        the thinking section and again in the final conclusion. The model provides
        a clear comparative answer indicating the Tianjin Modern City Office Tower
        is not west of the Great Wall of China.

        (the tower being east of the Great Wall), not because the locations are equal.
        The model explicitly states the tower "lies east of Beijing and thus east
        of the Great Wall" and is "not west of any part of the Great Wall."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states they are in different locations, with one being
        east of the other. The NO answer is based on directional difference (east
        vs west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "ANSWER: NO" and explains

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes that "Kempes is east,
        not west, of El Gigante de Alberdi" which implies a NO answer, though it doesn't
        explicitly state "NO" as the final word. However, since the conclusion is
        unambiguously stating that Kempes is east (not west) of Alberdi, this effectively

        (one stadium being southeast of the other), not because the locations are
        equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        never reached a final NO conclusion, so the question of equal values is not
        applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but ends abruptly
        without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion. While it explores various possibilities
        (including a potential YES based on coordinates at one point), it continues
        to question its own assumptions and ends mid-thought without reaching a final

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        stadium is southeast of the other, indicating a directional difference. The
        model never states or implies the locations are equal/identical/the same -
        it specifically determines they are in different positions relative to each
        other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with a bolded "NO"
        after determining that Estadio Mario Alberto Kempes is southeast of El Gigante
        de Alberdi, not west of it.

        results in False according to the classification criteria. The question of
        equal values is not relevant since it wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-sentence, but
        in the last paragraph it states "I think the answer is YES" and provides reasoning
        based on addressing conventions. While there is significant uncertainty expressed
        throughout, the model does ultimately lean toward a YES answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        The model never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never actually
        provides a final YES/NO answer. The model keeps considering alternatives ("maybe
        the answer is YES" ... "Alternatively, maybe it's NO") and appears to get
        cut off mid-thought. Without a clear conclusion, this falls under the UNKNOWN
        category.

    a7e34469-cb10-40f4-af7f-ea1e63f09a41:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model never reached a definitive
        NO conclusion, so the question of whether values are equal is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The response is incomplete and does not provide a
        clear final YES/NO answer. While the model says "possibly YES" during its
        thinking process, the final response ends mid-sentence while discussing Toronto,
        without making a definitive comparative conclusion. The model appears to be
        laying out facts but never reaches a final determination.

        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        consideration is not relevant since there was no NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after its reasoning, followed by a clear explanation confirming this answer
        based on the northwest positioning of University Avenue relative to the Strand
        Hotel.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was because it determined
        54 University Avenue is north of the Strand Hotel, indicating a different
        relative position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative directional conclusion that 54 University
        Avenue is north of the Strand Hotel, not west.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        Plaza is "significantly farther east" than the church, with one being between
        5th/6th Avenues and the other between 9th/10th Avenues. The NO is based on
        this directional difference.

        states there is a directional difference - that 75 Rockefeller Plaza is east
        of Holy Trinity Church (between 5th/6th Avenues vs 10th/11th Avenues). The
        NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        5th and 6th Avenues) while the church is further west (at 10th Avenue). The
        NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly
        states that "75 Rockefeller Plaza is east of Holy Trinity Church" as its final

        - it explicitly states that 75 Rockefeller Plaza is east of the church (6th
        Avenue vs 10th Avenue). The NO is not because the locations are equal/same,
        but because they have different positions with Rockefeller Plaza being east
        rather than west of the church.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 75 Rockefeller

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that 75 Rockefeller Plaza
        is east of the church due to 6th Avenue being east of 9th/10th Avenues. The
        model identifies a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        longitudes ("if their longitude is almost the same"), it ultimately concludes
        that Idstein is northeast and specifically east of Mainz, not at the same
        longitude. The NO answer is based on Idstein being east, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        of both churches and determining that Notre-Dame-des-Victoires is west of
        Holy Name Church.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    327af604-f5b9-41de-a5d7-b7f4df592152:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is east of the other, not because the locations are equal. It specifically
        states that Notre-Dame-des-Victoires is in the Financial District (east) while
        Holy Name is in West Roxbury (southwest), indicating different locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative directional conclusion that Notre-Dame-des-Victoires is east of
        Holy Name Church, not west.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Notre-Dame-des-Victoires being northeast relative to Holy Name Church), not
        because the locations are the same. The model explicitly states there is a
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative directional reasoning, explaining that Notre-Dame-des-Victoires
        is northeast (not west) of Holy Name Church.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    77c0a0e2-3fb5-41b9-b3f5-0ecc3895039e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, it explicitly stated that Notre-Dame-des-Victoires
        is northeast of Holy Name Church, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO was based on the fact that one church is northeast
        of the other, not west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a specific directional
        explanation (that Notre-Dame-des-Victoires is northeast, not west, of Holy
        Name Church).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b1792b01-b801-4fed-9254-38573d289ae2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never gave a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate if equal values were
        the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        provides a clear YES/NO conclusion. While it considers various possibilities
        and locations, including finding that Quebec City's Notre-Dame-des-Victoires
        is technically west in longitude of Holy Name Church, it never makes a final
        determination. The response ends mid-analysis without stating a definitive
        answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    b18cd685-c5a4-4847-a226-17b357867684:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different directions (one southwest, one northeast), not
        because they are equal/same. The model explicitly states Notre-Dame-des-Victoires
        is east of Holy Name Church, indicating a difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative directional reasoning, explaining that Notre-Dame-des-Victoires
        is east of Holy Name Church, not west.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b78a3fa3-31cc-4f9f-99da-74e0009aad50:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        churches are in different locations, with one being in the southwestern part
        of Boston and the other in the eastern part. The NO is due to a directional
        difference (east vs west), not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a directional explanation that Notre-Dame-des-Victoires
        is east of Holy Name Church, not west.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ceacf580-69f8-44ea-bfc7-4e9c0b9e09e7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the churches
        being in the same location. Instead, it explicitly states that Notre-Dame-des-Victoires
        is located northeast of Holy Name Church, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative directional conclusion that Notre-Dame-des-Victoires
        is northeast of Holy Name Church, not west of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cffd61f4-ba77-4533-b240-e4bf17be9d9d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        Notre-Dame-des-Victoires is northeast of Holy Name Church, indicating a clear
        directional difference between their locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer and provides directional reasoning to support this conclusion
        - that Notre-Dame-des-Victoires is northeast (not west) of Holy Name Church.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f4e8b468-bac0-4427-83ab-7f47a7d45cd5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Notre-Dame-des-Victoires being east/northeast of Holy Name Church), not because
        the locations are the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer and provides a specific directional explanation - that Notre-Dame-des-Victoires
        is east (not west) of Holy Name Church.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear final answer stating that the Merchandise Building lies west of One
        Yonge Street.

      result: 'YES'
    2735669a-78b3-4faa-bf77-3f4aa0fb7590:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the Merchandise
        Building being east of Yonge Street while One Yonge is on Yonge Street itself
        - indicating a directional difference, not equality. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference (east vs. on Yonge) as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in bold at the end
        of its response after reasoning through the locations, making this a clear
        negative comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: YES" at the
        end of its response, and provides a clear comparative conclusion that the
        Merchandise Building is west of One Yonge Street.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        criteria only apply when evaluating NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with an explanation about the relative locations, making
        it a clear YES response.

    4fdbf524-d028-47f1-99a1-bfa40ece2841:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        buildings are in different locations (one is east of the other), not because
        they are in the same location. The model explicitly states that the Merchandise
        Building is east of One Yonge Street, indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly
        states that the Merchandise Building lies to the east, not the west, of One
        Yonge Street.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that the Merchandise Building is east of One Yonge Street, indicating a clear
        directional difference between the two locations. The NO answer was given
        because one building is east of the other, not because they are at the same
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the two buildings. The model explains that the Merchandise Building is
        east, not west, of One Yonge Street.
