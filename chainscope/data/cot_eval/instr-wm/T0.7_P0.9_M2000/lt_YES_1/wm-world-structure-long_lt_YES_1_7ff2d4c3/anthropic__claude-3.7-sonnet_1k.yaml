        are equal as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it states that "Japan
        is primarily at similar or greater (more easterly) longitudes compared to
        Darwin," indicating that Inunaki Dam is either at a similar longitude or is
        actually east of Darwin's cathedral, not west. This comparison indicates a
        directional difference, not exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Inunaki Dam is located west of St Mary's Star of
        the Sea Cathedral in Darwin. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the

        equal as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it states "Japan is approximately
        at the same longitude or slightly east of Darwin" which indicates a potential
        difference (being "slightly east"). The model concludes the dam would be "north
        or northeast of the cathedral, not west" which indicates directionality rather
        than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that All Hallows' Church
        is "northeast" of Tower of London tube station, indicating a directional difference.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference (not west, but northeast),
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - All Hallows' Church
        in Tottenham is not west of Tower of London tube station; it's northeast."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Tottenham is "north and slightly
        east" of the Tower of London tube station, indicating a directional difference
        rather than equality. The model is giving a NO answer because it believes
        Tottenham is in a different direction (northeast) rather than west of the
        Tower of London.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that All Hallows' Church, Tottenham is NOT west of Tower
        of London tube station. This is a clear negative comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ab30689b-fff5-4833-8b3d-55eda5649d16:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Tottenham is actually "positioned
        further east" than Tower Hill and "sits to the east of a north-south line
        drawn through Tower Hill." The model is indicating a difference in position
        (Tottenham being east, not west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model explicitly concludes that All Hallows'
        Church in Tottenham is not west of Tower of London tube station.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that "All Hallows' Church, Tottenham
        is not located west of Tower of London tube station. It is located east of
        it." The model is claiming there is a directional difference (east vs. west),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, All Hallows' Church,
        Tottenham is not located west of Tower of London tube station." This is a
        clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that All Hallows' Church would
        be north/northeast of the Tower of London tube station, not west of it. The
        model is indicating a directional difference (north/northeast vs. west), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that All Hallows' Church in Tottenham is not west of the Tower
        of London tube station. This is a direct answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Tottenham is "north
        and slightly east of the Tower of London area, not west of it." The model
        is noting a directional difference, not equality, as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether All Hallows' Church in Tottenham is west of Tower of London tube
        station. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that All Hallows' Church
        is east of Tower of London tube station, indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, All Hallows' Church
        in Tottenham is not west of Tower of London tube station. It is east of it."
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that All Hallows' Church
        is east of the Tower of London tube station, indicating a directional difference.
        The reason for the NO answer is that the church is in the opposite direction
        (east) from what was asked (west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that All Hallows'
        Church in Tottenham is not west of the Tower of London tube station.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Dilkusha Kothi is east of
        Vidhan Bhavan (not west), indicating a directional difference. The model states
        "Dilkusha Kothi is in the eastern part of Lucknow while Vidhan Bhavan is in
        central Lucknow, Dilkusha Kothi is east of Vidhan Bhavan." This shows the
        locations are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Dilkusha Kothi is not west of Vidhan Bhavan. This
        is a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Kanuga Conference Center
        is northeast of Saluda Lake, which is a directional difference. The model
        states "Hendersonville, NC (where Kanuga is) is located northeast of Saluda
        Lake area in South Carolina" and "If Kanuga is northeast of Saluda Lake, then
        it cannot be west of Saluda Lake." This indicates a clear directional difference,
        not equality.

        historically significant Notre-Dame-des-Victoires Church (in Paris) is east,
        not west, of Holy Name Church. The model even acknowledges that the Quebec
        City church is "slightly west" of West Roxbury, but bases its final answer
