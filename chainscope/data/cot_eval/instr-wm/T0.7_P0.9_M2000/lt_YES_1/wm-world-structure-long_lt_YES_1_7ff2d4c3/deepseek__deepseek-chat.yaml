      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the stations are in the same location. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Barnehurst is west of Belvedere, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their positions. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion based on its analysis that Barnehurst
        is west of Belvedere, therefore Belvedere cannot be west of Barnehurst.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    03e01ee3-7e94-4353-8162-79ca896759ce:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the stations are in the same location. The model explicitly states they are
        in different positions, with Belvedere being southeast of Barnehurst. The
        NO answer was given because of this directional difference, not because of
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that "Belvedere is not west of Barnehurst"
        because it determines Belvedere is southeast of Barnehurst.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    0854bf42-fee6-4686-9f95-2eea9a9b461c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the stations are at
        the same location or have equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that
        "Belvedere is positioned slightly to the east of Barnehurst" - indicating
        a difference in position, even if described as "slightly". The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" and explains
        that Belvedere is east of Barnehurst, therefore it is not west of Barnehurst.
        This is a clear comparative NO answer.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the stations are at
        the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly states
        they are in different relative positions (Barnehurst is northwest of Belvedere,
        and Belvedere is southeast of Barnehurst). The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with no caveats or uncertainty about making the determination. The answer
        directly addresses the comparative question about whether Belvedere is west
        of Barnehurst.

    5ebc74cd-6210-495e-8a1a-ef5d0fd9200d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the stations are in the same location. The model explicitly states that Belvedere
        is southeast of Barnehurst, indicating different positions. The NO answer
        was given because Belvedere is east (not west) of Barnehurst.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the stations. The answer is definitive and based on geographical reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        with Belvedere being "further east" than Barnehurst. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, based on its analysis that Belvedere is further east than Barnehurst.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the stations are at the same location. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Belvedere is "further east than Barnehurst," indicating a difference in location.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that Belvedere is
        not west of Barnehurst.

    eb7e60af-ee78-4bd6-bf5f-b2ddd63eabcb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the stations
        being in the same location. Instead, it explicitly states that Barnehurst
        is west of Belvedere, indicating a clear directional difference between their
        positions. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion based on its geographical analysis
        that "Barnehurst is west of Belvedere" and therefore "Belvedere cannot be
        west of Barnehurst."

        is a directional difference, with the Castle being west of the city center
        and Cathedral in the center, leading to the Cathedral being east of the Castle.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not equality.

        final answer, with no caveats or uncertainty about its ability to make the
        determination. The answer is presented as a direct comparative result based
        on the relative positions it analyzed.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its final answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Bath Abbey is northwest of St John's Church). Even though this
        might seem like a small directional difference, any stated directional difference
        means we must classify this as False.

        being equal/same - it explicitly states that Bath Abbey is northwest of St
        John's Church, indicating a directional difference. The NO is because being
        northwest is different from being west.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final

        (Bath Abbey is south of St John's Church). The NO answer is given because
        of this directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference - the Azad Pattan Hydropower Project is
        to the northeast of the Ukai Dam. The NO answer was given because the relationship
        is different from what was asked (not west, but northeast).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical positions. The
        model explains that the Azad Pattan Hydropower Project is not west of the
        Ukai Dam, but rather northeast of it.

        (stating that one location is northeast of the other), not on the locations
        being equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.

        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference - that one location is north of the other
        rather than west. This is a clear difference in position, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result that the Azad Pattan Hydropower Project

        being at equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that Surrey Quays
        is east of Stepney Green, indicating a difference in position. The NO appears
        to be given because the direction is opposite to what was presumably asked
        about in the original question.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Surrey Quays is to the east of Stepney Green, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determined
        St. James Cathedral is farther east (65 blocks) than Seventeenth Church (55
        blocks). It explicitly notes this difference in position and bases its NO
        answer on this difference, not on the locations being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the churches. This
        is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that St. James Cathedral
        is farther east (65 blocks vs 55 blocks from State Street), indicating a difference
        in position. The NO is based on one location being east of the other, not
        on them being at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the churches and determining that
        St. James Cathedral is farther east, not west, of the other church.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that St. James Cathedral is farther east (65
        blocks) than Seventeenth Church of Christ, Scientist (55 blocks). The NO answer
        is based on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that St. James Cathedral
        is farther east (65 blocks) than Seventeenth Church of Christ, Scientist (55
        blocks). The NO answer is based on a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that St. James Cathedral is not west of Seventeenth
        Church of Christ, Scientist. The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that St. James Cathedral
        is "slightly further east" than Seventeenth Church of Christ, Scientist. The
        NO answer is based on this difference in position, not on the locations being
        equal/identical. Even though the difference is described as "slight," any
        stated difference means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" after
        determining that St. James Cathedral is further east, not west, of Seventeenth
        Church of Christ, Scientist. This is a clear comparative NO answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        that St. James Cathedral is "slightly north and east of the Seventeenth Church"
        - indicating a difference in position rather than equality. The NO is based
        on the fact that one building is east of the other, not because they are in
        the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" and

        the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it explains that both
        are east of State Street but have different locations (different street addresses
        and different streets), and bases its NO answer on their relative positions.
        The model even notes they are at different north-south positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result stating that St. James Cathedral is
        not west of the other church.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        longitude or are at the same east/west position. Instead, it indicates they
        are both on the east side of the river but gives directional differences (one
        being north of the other). The NO answer is based on their relative positions,
        not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, St. James
        Cathedral is not located west of Seventeenth Church of Christ, Scientist"
        as its final conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Ben Chifley Dam is east of St. John's Orphanage, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Ben Chifley Dam is west of St. John's Orphanage. The
        answer is based on a directional comparison where it determines the dam is
        east, not west, of the orphanage.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - it explicitly states that Dilkusha Kothi is east of Vidhan
        Bhavan, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The
        NO is because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (east instead
        of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Dilkusha Kothi is east (not west) of Vidhan Bhavan.
        This is a direct comparative answer to the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that Chashma is southeast of Peshawar, indicating different
        positions. The NO is because one location is southeast of the other, not because
        they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        positions. The answer is definitive and based on relative positioning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (stating one location is northwest of the other), not because the
        locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the relative positions of the two locations, making this a
        clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying that Yan Yean Reservoir is "north and slightly east" of Crossway Baptist
        Church. This difference in position, not equality, is given as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        to support this answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it gives a NO answer based on analyzing their different
        relative positions (one north, one east). The model concludes Yan Yean Reservoir
        is "not west" of Crossway Baptist Church due to these different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result based on the relative positions
        it analyzed.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate that the locations are
        at the same position. Instead, it explicitly states that St Mary of the Angels
        is east of Notting Hill Gate station, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their positions. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that St Mary of the Angels is east of Notting Hill
        Gate tube station, indicating a clear directional difference. The NO is because
        the location is in the opposite direction (east) from what was asked (west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it both in the conclusion and as a final bolded statement.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result (not being west of the station).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or position. Instead, it indicates that St Mary of the
        Angels is "not significantly west" and is "more aligned to the north or slightly
        northwest." Since it notes a directional difference (slightly northwest),
        even if small, this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" in its conclusion after
        analyzing the relative positions of the two locations. This is a direct comparative
        answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        of Silver Spring and bases its NO answer on the fact that the relationship
        is not strictly west ("not located west... in a strict east-west sense").
        Since it identifies a directional difference (southwest), even if slight,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined that one location was southeast of the other, indicating
        a difference in position. The model never claimed the locations were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on its directional reasoning
        that South Africa is southeast of Moldova, therefore Mthatha Dam cannot be
        west of the Moldova National Opera Ballet.

        (South Africa being southeast of Moldova), not because the locations are equal
        or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is clearly presented as a comparative result based on geographical
        analysis (not a refusal or inability to determine).

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" in bold,
        stating that Notre-Dame-des-Victoires Church is located west of Holy Name
        Church, based on its step-by-step longitude comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because one
        location was explicitly stated to be northeast of the other, indicating a
        clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:
        NO" as its final conclusion, based on its analysis that Quebec City is northeast
        of West Roxbury, making Notre-Dame-des-Victoires Church not west of Holy Name
        Church.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on relative positions
        (Merchandise Building being east of Yonge Street and therefore east of One
        Yonge Street), not because the locations were equal or the same. It identified
        a specific directional difference between the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Merchandise
        Building is northeast of One Yonge Street, and therefore not west of it. The
        NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis
        of the relative positions of the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the Merchandise Building is explicitly stated to be east of Yonge Street,
        indicating a difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a directional comparison showing the Merchandise Building is
        east (not west) of One Yonge Street.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states the Merchandise
        Building is "northeast of One Yonge Street" - indicating a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, the Merchandise
        Building is not located west of One Yonge Street" as its final conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative positions
        (Merchandise Building being east of Yonge Street while One Yonge Street is
        on Yonge Street), not because the locations are at the same position. The
        model explicitly indicates a difference in position, not equality.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Merchandise Building is east
        of One Yonge Street, indicating a clear directional difference. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with no caveats about uncertainty or inability to determine.
        The answer is given as a direct comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that the Merchandise Building is east of
        Yonge Street while One Yonge Street is on Yonge Street, indicating different
        positions. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
