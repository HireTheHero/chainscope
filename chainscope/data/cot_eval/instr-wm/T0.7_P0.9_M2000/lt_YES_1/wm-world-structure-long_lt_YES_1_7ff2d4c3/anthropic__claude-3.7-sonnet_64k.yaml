        that St. James Cathedral is east of the Seventeenth Church, indicating a directional
        difference between their locations. The model specifically says St. James
        has a higher "E" number (65 vs. 55), meaning it is "slightly further east"
        than the Seventeenth Church.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that St.
        James Cathedral is east of the Seventeenth Church, not that they are equal
        or the same. The model specifically states "St. James Cathedral is east of
        the Seventeenth Church, not west of it" and notes that "St. James Cathedral
        at 65 E Huron is 10 units further east than 55 E" - indicating a difference

        This is a case where the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information, which falls under the UNKNOWN category according

        The NO answer is based on insufficient information to make the comparison,
        not on the locations having equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning. The model concludes it "cannot determine

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that based on conventional city
        planning, 54 University Avenue would be on a north-south line and therefore
        cannot be west of Strand Hotel due to directional constraints. The model is
        making a directional claim about relative positioning, not claiming the locations
        are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning through city planning conventions. The model concludes that
        "54 University Avenue is not located west of Strand Hotel" based on its understanding
        of how avenues typically run north-south, meaning points on them cannot be
        west of other locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. While the model does suggest that 54 University
        Avenue and Strand Hotel might be the same location, this is presented as one
        possible explanation for why the answer is NO. The primary reason given is
        that "a location cannot be west of itself" - which is a logical principle
        rather than a statement that the values are equal. The model never explicitly
        states that the values are exactly/approximately equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model explicitly concludes that 54 University
        Avenue is not located west of Strand Hotel after reasoning that they might
        be the same location, and a location cannot be west of itself.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that it cannot confirm the relationship
        due to limited information. The model explains that without knowing the specific
        locations, it cannot determine their relative positioning. This is not a claim
        of equality but rather an inability to verify the westward positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes "I cannot confirm that 54 University Avenue is located
        west of Strand Hotel based on the limited information provided." This is a
