      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        stations are in the same location. The model explicitly states that "Barnehurst
        is slightly east of Belvedere" and "Barnehurst is generally more south and
        slightly east of Belvedere." The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions of the
        stations. The answer is explicitly stated in the conclusion: "Therefore, the
        answer to whether Belvedere railway station is located west of Barnehurst
        railway station is: NO"'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.

    2795dca4-bdf5-4642-9bdd-16db96b26db1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the stations are in "similar
        east-west position" and "very close", it doesn't explicitly state they are
        exactly equal/identical/the same. The response indicates they are just close
        in position rather than exactly equal, so this isn't a case of NO due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer...
        is: NO" as its final comparative answer'
      final_answer: 'NO'

    30459828-7895-4aa1-87e5-94f97b04935e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the stations are at
        the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it gives a directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer, stating that "Belvedere is southeast
        and Barnehurst is east." Even though this might be incorrect factually, the
        model indicates a directional difference rather than equality as its reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Belvedere station is west of Barnehurst station. This is
        a clear comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6e56b9ad-1cff-4a4d-b9f9-ece6e033edeb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether
        the model discussed equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it's not possible to
        conclusively say" and gives "UNKNOWN" as its final boxed answer. This indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    89918924-dfe7-40b6-9ba5-c78c4e65d1ee:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate that the stations are
        at the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly states
        that Belvedere is in the eastern part while Barnehurst is in the central and
        western parts of the borough, indicating a difference in location. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        in a boxed format after explaining its reasoning about the relative positions
        of the stations.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: 'Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False for question 2, as per the instructions that state "If the
        final answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        YES" and presents it in a boxed format. This is a clear, unambiguous YES answer
        to the comparative question.'

      result: 'YES'
    ffddaccc-9041-4b3a-9bbd-2c04bcb1d4cc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the exact
        positions and notes the stations are close to each other, it never explicitly
        states they are at the same longitude or exactly equal in east-west position.
        The NO answer appears to be based on the reasoning that Belvedere is likely
        not west of Barnehurst, rather than them being at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with a boxed "NO" answer,
        despite earlier expressing some uncertainty. Since there is a clear final
        NO answer, we classify this as NO rather than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the stations are at
        the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it indicates that Thames
        Ditton is southwest or south of Harrow-on-the-Hill, which implies different
        positions. The NO answer is given because of this directional difference,
        not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Thames Ditton station is west of Harrow-on-the-Hill station.
        The answer is clearly stated and provides a comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    22c8e9b0-18db-43d8-a48b-4395cfc6eaa3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Thames Ditton is southwest
        of Harrow-on-the-Hill. The NO answer is given because of this directional
        difference (southwest vs. purely west), not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" and provides this as a comparative result based on Thames Ditton being
        southwest rather than directly west of Harrow-on-the-Hill.'

      result: 'NO'
    2d708c84-7053-4bde-9cae-84170be5f629:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        YES" in a boxed format at the end of its step-by-step reasoning.'
      final_answer: 'YES'

    57cc65f6-62bd-4235-8169-3d406173ecf3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it states there is a directional difference
        (southwest vs west). Even though this might be a small difference, any stated
        directional difference means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that Thames Ditton is not directly west but rather southwest
        of Harrow-on-the-Hill station.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    67a4b2b7-e8b1-4238-8602-1aa957e0abb3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the stations
        being at equal positions. Instead, it explains that Thames Ditton is southwest
        while Harrow is northwest, indicating different positions. The NO comes from
        their relative positions being different from what was asked, not from them
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment about the westward
        relationship between the stations.'

    7da48e8d-1b67-4e55-8c7f-c1147521ccaa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer not because the locations
        are equal/same, but because it determines Thames Ditton is southwest while
        Harrow-on-the-Hill is northwest, indicating different positions. The NO is
        based on relative directional differences, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result, indicating Thames Ditton railway
        station is not located west of Harrow-on-the-Hill station.'

      result: 'NO'
    ac4d1e07-5491-43f6-ad85-001f45b521dc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the stations were at
        the same location or had equal coordinates. Instead, it gave NO because Thames
        Ditton was described as being southwest while Harrow-on-the-Hill was northwest,
        indicating different positions. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Thames Ditton railway station is located west of Harrow-on-the-Hill
        station. This was a clear comparative result.

    b26d59fa-83c1-4ce2-ac2d-1d47794d3c4b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        classifies as False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer...
        is: YES" in a boxed answer, making this a clear YES response despite noting

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that Thames Ditton is south/southwest of
        Harrow-on-the-Hill, describing a different relative position as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The final
        answer is: NO" in a boxed format at the end of its response, after providing

    e14e817d-3894-455e-80c7-a2e54bd8f3bc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Harrow-on-the-Hill
        is "north or northeast of Thames Ditton railway station" rather than west
        of it. The model identifies a specific directional difference between the
        locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that St Machar's Cathedral
        is "north and slightly east" of the Kirk of St Nicholas, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result about the relative locations of the two
        buildings. The answer is definitive and based on directional analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines St Machar's Cathedral
        is east of the Kirk of St Nicholas, indicating a difference in position ("St
        Machar's Cathedral in Old Aberdeen is likely east of the Kirk of St Nicholas
        in the city center").

        close," it explicitly indicates that St Machar's Cathedral is "slightly north
        and east of the Kirk of St Nicholas." The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (being east rather than west), not on the locations being equal
        or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether St Machar's Cathedral is located west of the Kirk of St

        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that St Machar's Cathedral is north or northeast of the Kirk of St Nicholas,
        indicating a different relative position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that St Machar's Cathedral is not west of the Kirk
        of St Nicholas. The model provides a specific directional relationship (north/northeast)
        as an alternative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that St Machar's Cathedral
        is northeast/north-northeast of Kirk of St Nicholas, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference - that St Machar's Cathedral is north of the Kirk
        of St Nicholas rather than west. The NO answer was based on this directional

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Possibly" and explicitly
        states it's "difficult to definitively say" whether one location is west of
        the other. This indicates uncertainty without providing a clear YES/NO answer.

        or the same. Instead, it explains that they are on the same north-south road
        but at different positions (one more north, one more south). The NO answer
        is given because they have a north-south relationship rather than an east-west
        one, not because they are in the same location.

        that The Grandview is east of Guardian Angel Cathedral ("The Grandview at
        Las Vegas, being on the Las Vegas Strip, would be east of Guardian Angel Cathedral").
        The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer in a boxed conclusion, indicating The Grandview is not west of

        The Grandview is "more south of the cathedral" rather than west. Since the
        NO is based on directional difference rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with a clear "NO" answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the locations being
        in different positions (with Japan being east of Australia), not because they
        are at the same location. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with Inunaki Dam being east of the cathedral.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis that Inunaki Dam is east, not west, of the cathedral.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Inunaki
        Dam is "likely to be east or northeast of Darwin" and is "not located west"
        of the cathedral. The NO answer was based on a directional difference (being
        east rather than west), not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold, making a clear comparative determination about the relative positions
        of the two locations. The model states that Inunaki Dam is not located west
        of St Mary's Star of the Sea Cathedral, and instead indicates it is likely
        east or northeast.

        between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

        Lake is not west of Lake Ray Roberts but rather east of it." This indicates
        a difference in position, not equality.

        not state that the stations are at equal positions. Instead, it explicitly
        describes different positions (Leicester Square in central/western London,
        Southgate in northern London) and states that Leicester Square is "more central
        and to the south of Southgate." The NO answer is based on relative positioning,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on the relative positions of the
        stations. The model does not indicate uncertainty or inability to determine
        the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the stations are in the same location. The model explicitly states they are
        in different locations (Leicester Square in central London and Southgate in
        North London) and gives directional differences (Leicester Square being "more
        central and to the south"). The NO answer was given because Leicester Square
        is not west of Southgate, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold, providing a clear comparative result about the relative positions
        of the two stations. The model concludes that Leicester Square is "not west
        of Southgate tube station" but rather "more central and to the south."

        Since it provides a directional difference as the reason for the NO answer,
        not equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Stratford International station is located west of St James'
        Church, Louth. This is a clear comparative result.

        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that Surrey Quays is "south
        and east" of Stepney Green, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        is based on Surrey Quays being east (not west) of Stepney Green, not because
        of equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Surrey Quays railway station is not
        west of Stepney Green tube station.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO" in a box, the reasoning
        leading up to it explicitly states "it's difficult to determine with certainty"
        and "without specific addresses or a map, it's challenging to provide a definitive

        their difference might be more north-south or northeast-southwest rather than
        east-west, but still acknowledges some positional difference exists. The NO
        appears to be based on inability to confirm one is definitively west of the
        other, not because of exact equality.

        in a boxed conclusion, making this a clear NO response. While the model expresses
        some uncertainty about exact positions, it does provide a definitive NO answer

        difference between the locations. Even though they are in the same city, the
        model identifies a specific directional relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result about the relative positions of the two

        one could be either east or west of the other ("potentially to the east or
        west of the performing arts center, depending on their specific addresses").
        The NO answer appears to be based on insufficient information to determine
        the westward relationship, not on equality of position.

        being equal/same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with the Cathedral being "north or northeast" of the Performing Arts Center.
        The NO is because the direction is different from what was asked (not west).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

        close to each other," but this is not the same as stating they are at exactly
        the same location. The model's NO answer appears to be based on the lack of
        significant westward difference rather than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with a boxed "NO" answer,
        making this a clear NO response. While the model expresses some uncertainty
        in its reasoning, it does provide a definitive final answer.

        being equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Green River
        Lake is northwest of the church, indicating a directional difference. The
        NO is based on the fact that the direction is northwest rather than purely
        west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on geographical analysis. The model
        indicates Green River Lake is northwest, not directly west, of the church.

        that Green River Lake is likely not west of the church, not because the locations
        are the same.

        that one church is south of the other, not because the locations are equal.
        The model explicitly states that Saint Gregory church is "south of Santiago
        Apostol Church" and uses this directional difference to conclude it's not
        west. There is no statement about the locations being equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        or the same. Instead, it indicates it cannot definitively determine the east-west
        positioning and expresses uncertainty about whether one is "slightly west
        or east" of the other. The NO answer appears to be based on the model's reasoning
        that Indang is "unlikely" to be directly west of Plaridel due to their relative
        positions, not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in a boxed answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are at different positions (Newport being east of Pontypool), not
        because they are at the same location. The model explicitly states there is
        a directional difference between the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the exact
        positions, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead,
        it suggests they are "not significantly separated" and Newport is "not significantly
        west" of Pontypool, implying some difference exists. Since equality is not
        stated as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with a boxed "NO" answer,
        despite earlier expressing some uncertainty. Since there is a clear final
        NO answer, we classify this as NO rather than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

        them as being in different positions, with Chashma Nuclear Power Plant being
        "more towards the central-eastern part" and Bala Hissar being "in the northwest."
        The NO was given because Chashma is east/southeast of Bala Hissar, not because
        they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Chashma Nuclear Power Plant is located west of Bala
        Hissar, Peshawar. The answer is given as a direct comparative result, not
        as an inability to determine.

        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Chashma Nuclear Power Plant is "east of Bala Hissar" and uses this directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer. Any stated difference in position,
        even if described as slight (though in this case it wasn't), means we should
        classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        Kanuga Conference Center is north of Saluda Lake rather than west of it. The
        model indicates a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, it specifically stated that Saluda
        Lake is "slightly west" of Kanuga Conference Center - indicating a difference
        in position, even if small. Any stated difference, even if described as slight,
        means this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that Saluda Lake is actually slightly west of Kanuga Conference
        Center (rather than Kanuga being west of Saluda Lake as asked in the question).

        Kanuga Conference Center is east of Saluda Lake, not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference ("Kanuga Conference Center is not west of Saluda Lake but rather

        or the same. Instead, it describes their relative positions (one being in
        western North Carolina and the other in South Carolina) and arrives at NO
        based on their geographic relationship, though the exact reasoning for NO
        is not clearly explained. Since equality is not mentioned as the reason for
        the NO answer, this should be classified as False.

        is "northwest" of Saluda Lake and "not directly west." The model identifies
        a directional difference (even if slight) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        Kings Arms is northwest of the station, indicating a directional difference.
        The NO answer was given because the direction is northwest rather than purely

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Kings Arms is located to the east of Chislehurst railway station, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO answer was based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the two locations. The model states that Kings Arms is east of, not west
        of, Chislehurst railway station.

        or the same. Instead, it indicates that the Kings Arms is "south or southeast"
        of Chislehurst railway station, which implies a directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer is based on directional reasoning rather than
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether the Kings Arms is west of Chislehurst railway station. The

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Kings Arms, Woolwich is "east of Chislehurst railway station" and specifically
        says it's "not west but rather east." The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis. The model is confident in this answer and provides specific directional
        reasoning (stating one location is east, not west, of the other).

        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with a clear "NO" answer
        in response to whether Kings Arms is west of Chislehurst railway station.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        describing Little Goose Dam as being "north and slightly west" of the church's
        location. This directional difference, even though described as "slight,"
        means the values are not equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Loon Church is
        east of Jimenez Church ("Bohol is east of Misamis Occidental, it's likely
        that Loon Church is east of Jimenez Church"). Even though there is some uncertainty
        in the analysis, the model indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Loon Church is west of Jimenez Church. While there is some
        uncertainty in the analysis, the model makes a clear final determination.

        locations are different - specifically that Loon Church is east of Jimenez
        Church. The model does not state or suggest the locations are equal/same/identical
        as the reason for its NO answer.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states the answer is "UNDETERMINED"
        and explains it cannot make the comparison without more specific location
        information. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates
        it cannot determine the relationship.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives NO as an answer because it determines the Beles
        Hydroelectric Power Plant is "northwest or north" of the Outspan Hotel, not
        directly west. The difference in position is the reason for the NO answer,
        not equality of positions.

        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the power plant
        is "not west of the hotel but rather north or northeast" - indicating a different
        relative position. The reason for NO is that one location is north/northeast
        of the other, not that they are in the same location.

        being equal/same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (northwest vs west). The NO is because the reservoir is northwest rather than
        directly west of the church.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that Yan Yean Reservoir is not west of Crossway Baptist Church

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Nittele Tower is east of
        Ginza Six, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite some earlier uncertainty in its reasoning. While
        the reasoning seems somewhat contradictory (saying "likely not west" but then
        concluding "YES"), we must take the explicit final "YES" answer at face value
        per the instructions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that Garissa Solar
        Power Station is "to the south or southeast of Rostov State Musical Theater"
        rather than west of it. Since the NO answer is based on a directional difference
        rather than equality, this is False.

        for its NO answer. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Garissa Solar Power Station is located west of Rostov State
        Musical Theater. The answer is clearly stated and provides a comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Garissa is east of Rostov, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        answer was given because their relative positions are opposite to what was
        asked (west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with a boxed "NO" answer
        to whether Garissa Solar Power Station is west of Rostov State Musical Theater.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on its analysis that Garissa
        is east of Rostov-on-Don, stating "eastern Kenya (where Garissa is located)
        is generally east of southern Russia (where Rostov-on-Don is located)." The
        NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.

        or the same. Instead, it explains that they are "separated by a significant
        distance" and "on different continents." The NO answer is based on the complexity
        of comparing locations "in different hemispheres and on opposite sides of
        the globe," not because they are at the same location or coordinates.

        Even though this might seem contradictory with a NO answer, we must evaluate
        based on what was stated, not logical consistency.

        White House plantation is south of AFI Silver rather than west. The model
        makes a directional distinction between the locations, even if focusing on
        north-south rather than east-west differences.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Raichak is "rather east" of Haldia, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result, indicating that Raichak on Ganges
        is not west of Haldia Energy Power Station (in fact stating it is east).'

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Raichak on Ganges is west of
        Haldia Energy Power Station.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - specifically
        that Raichak is north of Haldia, not west of it. The model identifies a clear
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result (concluding that Raichak is not

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Raichak
        is east of Haldia, not west. It explicitly states a directional difference
        ("Raichak on Ganges is on the eastern side... Haldia Energy Power Station
        is on the western side") rather than stating the locations are at the same
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in a boxed format, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (indicating
        Raichak is east, not west, of Haldia)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this wasn't because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly described a difference
        in positions, stating that Haldia is west of Raichak (meaning Raichak is east
        of Haldia). The NO answer was given because the direction was opposite to
        what was asked in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Raichak on Ganges is west of Haldia Energy Power Station.
        The model explicitly states this in its conclusion: "Therefore, the answer
        to the question ''Is Raichak on Ganges located west of Haldia Energy Power
        Station?'' is NO"'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates that Haldia is located "more
        towards the east or southeast of Raichak on Ganges" and provides directional
        differences based on the river flow. The NO answer is based on relative positioning,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that Lake Winnibigoshish is "not west of
        Wright Patman Lake but rather north." The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (being north rather than west), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result based on its geographic analysis,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Lake Winnibigoshish is not west of
        Wright Patman Lake because of their relative positions (with one being north
        of the other). The NO answer is based on directional differences, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the lakes are at the same longitude or equally west/east. Instead, it
        explains that Lake Winnibigoshish is north of Wright Patman Lake, and uses
        this different relative position (north vs. south) as the basis for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold, providing a clear comparative result about the westward position
        of Lake Winnibigoshish relative to Wright Patman Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or otherwise equal in position. Instead, it gives a NO
        answer because of their relative positions, describing Lake Winnibigoshish
        as being "more towards the western part of Minnesota" and Wright Patman Lake
        as being "more towards the eastern part of Texas." The NO is based on their
        different positions, not on them being equal.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Altitude building would be
        east of the Sri Lankan Parliament Building, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as the answer, it does not
        state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explains they
        are "thousands of miles apart" and "on opposite sides of the world." The NO
        answer is based on their different relative positions, not because they share
        the same location or coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when determining if Altitude is west of the Sri Lankan Parliament Building.

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Upper Boat Studios is east
        of St Mary's Church. The NO answer is given because the direction is opposite
        to what was asked (east instead of west), not because the locations are at

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        based on typical city layouts, the locations would likely be north/south of

        never reached a conclusion about equal values, instead stating it couldn't
        make the comparison due to lack of context.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "No answer possible without
        additional context" which indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient

        are in the same city or town, and if 54 University Avenue is west of Strand
        Hotel based on the layout of the city, the answer would be YES"). However,
        the model heavily caveats this by stating it cannot provide a definitive answer
        "without more specific information" and emphasizes the challenge of determining
        relative positions. This indicates the model is effectively refusing to make
        a definitive comparison due to insufficient information.
