      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations have different relative positions (Belvedere is east of Barnehurst),
        not because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states a directional
        difference rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response based
        on its geographical analysis that Belvedere is east, not west, of Barnehurst.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is YES" and
        confirms "YES, Belvedere railway station is located west of Barnehurst railway
        station." This is a clear, unambiguous YES answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations have different positions (one is east of the other), not because
        they are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a directional reason (Belvedere is east,
        not west of Barnehurst)

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any discussion of
        values or equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "YES" twice
        - once in step 4 and once as a final standalone answer.

    7ba094d8-a6e1-4674-b7c6-094ea27d419f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Belvedere is "slightly south and east of Barnehurst" - indicating a directional
        difference, not equality. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        as its final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating
        Belvedere is NOT west of Barnehurst)
      final_answer: 'NO'

    8a82300d-5400-40e8-9865-26842bca6273:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical - the model explicitly states that
        Belvedere is east of Barnehurst, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a directional reason (that
        Belvedere is east, not west of Barnehurst)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8be15ff1-f5b4-4573-a096-9a123a36b392:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Belvedere is explicitly stated to be east of Barnehurst, indicating a difference
        in location. The model did not claim the locations were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the explanation and once as a final standalone answer. The model
        provides a clear directional reason (Belvedere being east, not west of Barnehurst)
        for this NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cd441f66-fdb8-45d6-8605-d19ea763e051:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it explicitly states that Belvedere is
        east of Barnehurst, indicating a directional difference. The NO is because
        the relationship is opposite to what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response based
        on the relative positions (stating Belvedere is east, not west, of Barnehurst).

    001f29a6-fec6-488a-ad85-e2bf7c7b9012:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        after its step-by-step analysis, making this a clear affirmative answer.'

    2441b294-f329-4154-8652-c8c80fe5dbb0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (Thames Ditton being southwest rather than purely west of Harrow-on-the-Hill),
        not because the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly notes
        they are in different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with directional reasoning provided.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    261697f6-6650-4727-a1f8-41a9827359c8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not
        relevant to evaluate since we only assess this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        after its step-by-step analysis, providing a clear affirmative answer to the
        comparison.'

    652b30dc-eb63-474e-bb9c-767b88f2e46a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly notes they are in different quadrants
        of London and gives directional differences as the reason for its NO answer.
        The NO is based on Thames Ditton being "more south than west compared to Harrow-on-the-Hill"
        rather than any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final comparative conclusion, based on its geographical
        analysis.'

    91f2b1aa-3e10-43f0-a34b-7538224a15d2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because Thames
        Ditton was determined to be southwest rather than directly west of Harrow-on-the-Hill,
        indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:
        NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical comparison showing
        Thames Ditton is southwest, not directly west, of Harrow-on-the-Hill.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9beb1adb-8f9f-4ac3-b2f9-54cf8a034475:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Thames Ditton is southwest of Harrow-on-the-Hill,
        and the NO answer is given because Thames Ditton is not directly west (but
        rather southwest) of the other location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the geographical positions.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c47eff58-fc46-4a2f-8eb4-12a33e7d59ef:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it explains that Thames Ditton is southwest
        (not directly west) of Harrow-on-the-Hill. The NO is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing it as a direct response
        after its step-by-step analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f4b87649-ad14-433d-9be3-25ff83ae5487:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Thames Ditton
        railway station is located west of Harrow-on-the-Hill station." This is a
        clear, direct YES answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    f8641c6d-816e-42d8-b0cc-ccc297d1e475:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as an answer, but not because the
        locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Thames Ditton is southwest
        of Harrow-on-the-Hill, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        is given because Thames Ditton is "not precisely west" rather than because
        the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions of the
        two stations. The answer is explicitly stated and addresses the comparison
        directly.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (south/southeast vs west), not because the locations are at the same position.
        The model explicitly states they are "quite far apart geographically" and
        gives different relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides directional reasoning that St Peter''s Church is south/southeast
        of Canonbury railway station, not west.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        discussion of equality or differences.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot verify the locations precisely enough
        to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot determine the answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (east vs west), not because the locations are at the same position. The model
        explicitly states one location is east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear directional reason (the church is east,
        not west of the station)

    6b923bc5-1174-4e48-b158-a3fc6b94f007:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - in fact, it explicitly states they are "quite
        far from each other" and that the church is "east of" the station, indicating
        a clear directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the locations and determining
        that St Peter''s Church is east of Canonbury station.'

    810b0776-dc0c-4b32-a198-552bf13b4364:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference as the reason
        for NO - explaining that one location is south of the other, not west. The
        NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO." This is a clear, direct NO answer to the comparative question.'

    8c63d844-5bbd-4487-ad46-3cd28ba06228:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that St
        Peter's Church is east of Canonbury station (not west), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly notes a directional difference
        ("is actually east of"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct response based on geographical
        positions.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states they are "quite
        far apart" and that one is "southeast" of the other. The NO is based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that St Peter's
        Church is southeast of (not west of) Canonbury station.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates they are "quite different parts of London"
        and that one would be "southeast" of the other, indicating a directional difference.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to the comparative question, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are "quite far from each
        other" and that St Peter's Church would be "south and east of Canonbury railway
        station". The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating one location is north of the other), not because the locations are
        equal. The model explicitly states St Machar's Cathedral is north of Kirk
        of St Nicholas, and this difference in position is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never discussed equal values anyway.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and would need to verify exact positioning. This indicates
        inability to make the comparison rather than refusal or a clear YES/NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that St Machar's Cathedral
        is northwest of Kirk of St Nicholas, indicating a directional difference.
        The NO was due to the direction being northwest rather than purely west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing a clear directional reasoning for why one location
        is not west of the other (it's northwest instead).

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly states that St Machar's
        Cathedral is north of Kirk of St Nicholas, indicating different positions.
        The NO is because one is north rather than west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, providing a direct comparative answer that one
        location is not west of the other (rather, it's north).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Grapevine
        Lake is east of Lake Ray Roberts (opposite of what was presumably asked),
        not because the lakes are at the same location. The model explicitly notes
        a difference in position ("Grapevine Lake is actually east of Lake Ray Roberts"),
        so this is not a case of equal values.

        not west.

        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Kew Bridge is
        southwest of Brockley Hill, indicating a difference in position. The NO is
        because Kew Bridge is not directly west, but rather southwest.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that Kew Bridge railway station is not located west

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Ledreborg was explicitly stated to be east of Gothenburg Cathedral, indicating
        a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        that Ledreborg is east of Gothenburg Cathedral and therefore not west of it.

        east" of Stepney Green), which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        that Surrey Quays is "further south and slightly east" of Stepney Green, concluding

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that one location is east of the other ("Malaysia is east of Laos"), indicating
        a clear difference in position. The NO is based on the fact that the relationship
        is opposite to what was asked (east instead of west), not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the geographical

        it's "actually SOUTH... not west". The NO is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        St. James Cathedral is EAST of the other church (due to having a higher E
        coordinate number), indicating a difference in position. The NO appears to
        be rejecting a premise about one being west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "Therefore,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that "both are east of each
        other," it doesn't explicitly state they are at the same location or have
        equal coordinates. The NO answer appears to be based on the fact that both
        are in the eastern part of downtown Chicago, not because they are at identical
        locations. The model does not explicitly state equality as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice - once in step

        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but indicates it cannot determine the geographic relationship due to lack
        of information. Since the model states it "cannot confidently say" and lacks
        "precise location information," this is effectively stating it cannot make
        the determination, making this an UNKNOWN response despite the "NO" at the

        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but indicates this
        is due to inability to verify the comparison ("I cannot confidently state

        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confidently say YES,
        so by default, the answer is NO)" but this is actually expressing uncertainty
        and inability to determine the relationship, not a definitive comparative
        result. The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently determine the precise
        west/east relationship." This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        Kothi is "east of Vidhan Bhavan, not west" - indicating a directional difference,
        not equality. The NO is due to the locations being in different positions,
        not because they are the same.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Dilkusha Kothi is east of Vidhan
        Bhavan, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The
        NO is because the stated relationship (west of) is incorrect, not because
        the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on the relative locations of the

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (Chashma is east of
        Peshawar, not west). Any directional difference, even if slight, means this
        is not an equality case.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it gave NO because it found
        that Chashma is actually east of Peshawar, indicating a different directional
        relationship than what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final

        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        Chashma is east of Bala Hissar, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer was given because Chashma is east (not
        west) of Bala Hissar.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the conclusion stating "The answer is NO" and again as a final standalone
        "NO". The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        Pakhtunkhwa (where Bala Hissar is) and that "Bala Hissar/Peshawar is west
        of Chashma Nuclear Power Plant". The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether Chashma Nuclear Power Plant is west of Bala Hissar.

        It actually emphasizes that the locations are "hundreds of miles apart" rather
        than being equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        despite earlier hesitation. While it expresses uncertainty about making the
        comparison, it ultimately provides a definitive NO answer rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it actually stated they were in different
        cities.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (the question cannot be answered
        as stated because the buildings are not in the same location)". Since this
        is rejecting the premises of the question rather than making a comparative
        determination, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

    e08bf19b-3ce3-439f-a01b-678ca7f5e2fe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it questioned the existence
        of one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm the premise
        of the question)" and rejects the premise by noting that one of the locations
        doesn't appear to exist in Memphis. When a model rejects the premises or indicates
        it cannot determine/verify, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        position rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Kanuga Conference

        In fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        being equal/same/identical - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (one is east of the other). The NO is because the relationship
        is opposite to what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly indicates this
        is because it "cannot definitively answer" and "cannot confidently say" due
        to lack of knowledge. This makes it a case of being unable to determine rather
        than a comparative result, which classifies as UNKNOWN per the criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated they were in different locations
        and gave a directional difference as the reason for the NO answer (stating
        that the power plant is in Ethiopia which is east of Kenya where the hotel
        is located). The NO was based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO." This is a clear, direct NO answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating that Beles is east of Outspan Hotel), not because the locations are
        at the same position. The model explicitly notes a difference in position,
        saying "Ethiopia is east of Kenya."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, providing a direct comparative answer based on
        geographical reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states they are in different
        countries and that Beles Power Plant is east (not west) of Outspan Hotel.
        The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that the locations
        are different and in different countries, with one being east of the other.
        The NO is given because one location is east rather than west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating
        that since the location is east, not west as asked, the answer is NO).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Beles Hydroelectric Power Plant is east of Outspan Hotel, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO answer was given
        because the direction was opposite to what was asked in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the geographical
        relationship between the two locations. The model states this twice for emphasis,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates they are in different positions (one in
        western Ethiopia, one in central Kenya) and concludes NO based on their relative
        positions being different, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as its reason for
        NO, stating that "Yan Yean Reservoir is more likely to be EAST of the church,
        not west." Since it indicates a directional difference (even if uncertain),
        this is not a case of equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states they
        are in "different directional references" and that Yan Yean Reservoir is "more
        north/northwest of the church" - indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

        - instead, it explicitly states that one location is southwest of the other,
        and uses this directional difference as the reason for saying NO (since southwest
        is not directly west). The values being compared are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO answer was given because
        the model found that White House plantation is southwest of AFI Silver rather
        than directly west. The model identified a specific directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result about the directional relationship between
        the two locations. The model determined that while White House plantation
        is southwest of AFI Silver, it is not directly west.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that "Rockbourne is actually east
        of Sutton Coldfield, not west" - indicating a difference in position, not
        equality. The NO was based on the locations being in different relative positions
        than what was apparently asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO." This is a clear, direct NO answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Rockbourne
        is southwest of Sutton Coldfield, and explains that being "west" would mean
        being directly west, which Rockbourne is not. The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result about the westward relationship between
        the two locations. The answer is definitive and matches the format "Answer:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly notes they are "quite far apart" and that Rockbourne
        Villa is east of Sutton Coldfield. The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations.'

    6d115efe-9af4-4377-b6d2-2f226eeceef1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer, but not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it gave NO because Rockbourne
        is southwest rather than directly west of Sutton Coldfield, indicating a difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        after determining that while Rockbourne is southwest of Sutton Coldfield,
        it is not directly west of it.'

    81b16ecf-b0ba-48b2-9cc9-3f83d4ae7a11:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (Rockbourne is "significantly east of
        Sutton Coldfield"). It does not state that the locations are equal or the
        same - rather, it explicitly states they are "quite far apart." The NO is
        because one is east of the other, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer based on its geographical
        analysis that Rockbourne is east of Sutton Coldfield, not west.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Rockbourne
        is southwest of Sutton Coldfield, not directly west, which is the reason given
        for the NO answer. The presence of any directional difference (in this case
        being southwest rather than west) means this isn't an equality case.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result about the geographical relationship
        between the two locations. The answer is definitive and based on directional
        analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that the locations
        are "quite far apart" and that "Rockbourne is significantly east of Sutton
        Coldfield, not west." The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" and "Rockbourne
        Roman Villa is NOT located west of Sutton Coldfield Town Hall" as its final
        answer. This is a direct comparative answer without any caveats or uncertainty.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer because Rockbourne
        is southwest of Sutton Coldfield, not directly west. It explicitly noted a
        directional difference (southwest vs. west) rather than stating the locations
        were at the same position or coordinates. The NO was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the geographical positions of both locations. This
        was a clear comparative result, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Rockbourne Roman Villa is explicitly stated to be east of Sutton Coldfield
        Town Hall, indicating a difference in position ("Hampshire is actually east
        of the West Midlands").
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical analysis

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer - specifically
        that one location is north of the other rather than west ("No, it is not west,

        equality of positions.

        is "no meaningful west or east relationship." The NO answer comes from the
        impossibility of making a meaningful directional comparison, not from the
        locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it first explains why a directional comparison is problematic.

        that Idstein is east of Mainz and concludes NO based on this directional difference.
        The NO answer comes from finding a specific directional relationship (east
        vs west), not from equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, specifically concluding that "Unionskirche, Idstein is NOT located
        west of Electoral Palace, Mainz." This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Aliyar Reservoir
        is "actually east of Idukki Dam, not west" and notes that "Idukki being more
        westward." This indicates a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because
        the model determined the Merchandise Building is east (opposite to what was
        asked) of One Yonge Street.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, based on finding that the Merchandise Building is
        east (not west) of One Yonge Street.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        after its step-by-step analysis'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    82afc598-70a7-4fd9-90a7-5435282a8f72:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Merchandise Building is east of Yonge Street), not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly notes a directional difference rather
        than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion based on its geographical analysis
        that the Merchandise Building is east, not west, of One Yonge Street.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    abdbeec7-adef-4ad1-b9f6-594bb058d95e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Merchandise Building is
        east of One Yonge Street, indicating a difference in location. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, and provides this as a direct comparative answer
        based on its analysis of the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b84e49aa-29ac-4e0a-ba7e-cc65ce32a620:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating one location is east of the other, not west), not because the locations
        are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (east vs west) for
        this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bbe29824-6791-40da-a6ed-e822a064f7aa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different directions (east vs west), not because they are
        equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states the Merchandise Building
        is east of the reference point.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, based on finding that the location is east rather
        than west.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d78e2bf6-eb6d-4500-a756-87d4a7d11013:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any equality comparisons
        in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        after its step-by-step analysis, making this a clear YES answer.'
