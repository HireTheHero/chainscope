      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (death dates)
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Muhammad al-Khushani died around
        1570 while Costanzo Festa died in 1545, and concludes NO because 1545 is earlier
        than 1570. The NO answer is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Muhammad al-Khushani died earlier than Costanzo
        Festa. The model provides dates and a clear comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found that Costanzo
        Festa died in 1545, which is earlier than Muhammad al-Khushani who died in
        1577. The model explicitly states this difference in dates as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates of Muhammad al-Khushani (1577) and Costanzo
        Festa (1545). The model clearly provides this as its definitive comparative
        conclusion.

        Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland, died earlier or later than Roger

        1527, while Roger Pierre likely died in the late 1500s, indicating different
        dates. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on a comparison of
