        that it cannot confirm that Franz Kasimir von Kleist died earlier than Edmond
        van Saanen Algi. However, this is not a straightforward comparative NO. The
        model is actually indicating it cannot make the comparison because it lacks
        information about one of the subjects (Edmond van Saanen Algi). The model
        states "we cannot definitively compare the death dates" and "without a death
        date for Edmond van Saanen Algi, we cannot conclude that von Kleist died earlier."
        This indicates inability to determine rather than a definitive comparative
        result.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values -
        it actually found the values to be different (1537 vs 1848) and concluded
        YES.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        at the end of its response, clearly indicating that Franciscus Titelmans died
        at an earlier date than Friedrich Balduin von Gagern.'
