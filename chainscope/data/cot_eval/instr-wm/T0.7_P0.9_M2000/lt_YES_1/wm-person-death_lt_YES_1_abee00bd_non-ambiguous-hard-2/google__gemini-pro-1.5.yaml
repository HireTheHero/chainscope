        information about Eilika's exact death date. The model explicitly states "We

        indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.

        in dates (Eilika potentially dying around 1096, which would be after Robert's

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, based on the

        (death dates) are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that one death date
        (Pierre Moulu's) is unknown, which makes the comparison impossible. The reason
        for the NO is not that the death dates are equal, but rather that one date
        is unknown, making a definitive comparison impossible.
