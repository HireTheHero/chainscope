      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (because we cannot
        verify that Joaquim de Siena died earlier than Alonso de Ribera)". This is
        a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify" which falls under the
        UNKNOWN category according to the instructions. The model is indicating it
        cannot make the comparison due to lack of information about one of the subjects.

        where the model is saying "NO" but is actually indicating it cannot determine
        the answer due to lack of information about Joaquim de Siena's death date.
        The parenthetical explanation makes it clear that this is not a comparative

        if he died earlier than Alonso de Ribera. The NO is based on insufficient
        information, not on equality of values.

        "NO" but is actually indicating it cannot determine the answer due to lack

      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final

        "we cannot confirm that Guillaume Ragutel de Montfort died after Rostislav

        This shows the model is saying NO because it lacks information to make the

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values

        that the comparison was reversed - Guillaume died earlier (1101) than Rostislav
        (1262), not the other way around as the question asked. The model clearly
        identified different death dates (1101 vs 1262) and based its NO answer on
        this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" at

        The model explicitly states "Guillaume de Montfort (d. 1101)" died before

        information that Guillaume died after 1262. The model is not claiming equality
        of values as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model expresses uncertainty about Guillaume Ragutel de Montfort's
        identity and death date, it still provides a definitive "NO" answer to the
