      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes, Crowell, TX is located
        west of Lake Panorama, IA." This is a clear affirmative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED,
        according to the instructions, I must classify this as False. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer
        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a YES or NO answer to the
        comparison. Instead, it states that the question is unclear and lacks necessary
        information about the locations. This is effectively a refusal to answer the
        comparative question due to insufficient information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Crowell, TX is not west of Lake
        Panorama, IA without explaining that this is because they have the same longitude
        or are at the same position. The model does not provide any reason for its
        NO answer that involves equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Crowell, TX is not
        located west of Lake Panorama, IA." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

    798e9fe9-2f98-4c8a-81bb-dc9ddc70ce3c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "Iowa is east of Texas" which implies that
        Crowell, TX (in Texas) is west of Lake Panorama, IA (in Iowa), not east. The
        model is giving a directional reason for its NO answer, not claiming the locations
        have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" and clarifies that "Crowell, TX is not located west of Lake Panorama,
        IA." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        (the longitudes of Crowell, TX and Lake Panorama, IA) are equal or the same.
        It simply states that Crowell, TX is not west of Lake Panorama, IA without
        mentioning equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is no. Crowell,
        TX is not located west of Lake Panorama, IA." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides information that Deadwood, SD
        is in South Dakota and Simonton, TX is in Texas, which implies they are different
        locations in different states. The NO answer appears to be based on this difference
        rather than any equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        the comparative question. The response begins with "If the question is about
        cities in the United States, then the answer is 'NO.'" This is a clear negative
        response.

        for the NO answer, stating "Florida is east of Pennsylvania" which implies
        Pomona Park is east (not west) of Lorane. This is a difference in values,
        not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states that Pomona Park is
        not west of Lorane, without indicating that they are at the same longitude
        or otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Pomona Park, FL is

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        or same values. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating "Alabama is east of North Carolina" as the basis for concluding that
        Pickensville is not west of Ellenboro. This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment that Pickensville,
        AL is not located west of Ellenboro, NC.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the locations
        have equal values (same longitude). It simply states that Pickensville, AL
        is not west of Ellenboro, NC without mentioning equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Pickensville, AL
        is not located west of Ellenboro, NC." This is a clear negative response to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Pickensville, AL
        is located east of Ellenboro, NC, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Pickensville, AL is located east of Ellenboro, NC, which is
        the reason for the negative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model
        did not make any comparison or state that values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model has outlined a step-by-step approach to
        answer the question but has not actually executed these steps or provided
        a final YES/NO answer. The response only lists the methodology it would use
        to determine the answer without reaching a conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Pickensville, AL is located in
        Alabama. There is no indication that the NO answer was given because two values
        are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "No, Pickensville, AL is located
        in the state of Alabama." This is a clear NO answer to whatever comparative
        question was asked.

        are equal or the same. It simply states that "Fairmead, CA is not located
        west of Clancy, MT" without indicating that they are at the same longitude
        or otherwise equal in position. The model does not give equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the longitudes of Fairmead, CA and Clancy, MT) are equal or the same. It
        simply states that Fairmead is not west of Clancy without explaining that
        this is because they have the same longitude. The model doesn't provide any
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Fairmead, CA is not
        located west of Clancy, MT." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative

        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer to
        the comparison question. Instead, it states that the question is unclear and
        lacks necessary information about the locations. This indicates the model
        cannot make the requested comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED,
        according to the instructions, I must classify this as False. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer
        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a YES or NO answer to the
        comparison. Instead, it states that the question is unclear and lacks necessary
        information about the locations. This is effectively a refusal to answer the
        comparative question.

        implying that Talco, TX (in Texas) is west of White Pigeon, MI (in Michigan).
        The NO answer is given because the model believes the statement "Talco, TX
        is located west of White Pigeon, MI" is incorrect, but not because the locations
        have the same coordinates or are equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Talco, TX is not located west of White Pigeon, MI." This is a clear

        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it could not have given
        a NO answer because the values being compared are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not provide a clear YES
        or NO answer to the comparison question. Instead, it states that "It is not
        clear if you are asking about the location of Knightsville, IN and Bantam,
        CT." The model is indicating uncertainty about the question itself rather
        than providing any comparative judgment. This falls under the UNKNOWN category

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not provide a clear YES
        or NO answer to the comparison question. Instead, it states that it is unclear
        what the question means by certain terms. This indicates the model is unable
        to make the requested comparison due to lack of clarity in the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states that Berwyn, IL is
        not west of West Conshohocken, PA without indicating that this is because
        they have the same longitude or are in the same location. The model does not
        provide any explanation about equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Berwyn, IL is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "New Jersey is east of South Carolina" which
        implies that Folly Beach (in SC) is not west of Lake Hiawatha (in NJ), but
        rather east of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        New Jersey" but concludes that "Folly Beach, SC is not located west of Lake
        Hiawatha, NJ." The NO answer is based on a directional claim, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, making a clear negative comparative judgment.
        However, it then immediately states that the question is not clear and doesn't
        provide enough information to make the comparison. This indicates the model
        is actually saying it cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - that Massachusetts is east of Florida, implying that Masaryktown (in Florida)
        is actually east of New Bedford (in Massachusetts), not west. The model is
        indicating a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Masaryktown, FL is not located west of New Bedford, MA." This is a
        clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        according to the instructions, I must classify this as False. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer
        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a YES or NO answer to the
        comparison. Instead, it states that the question is unclear and lacks necessary
        information about the locations. This is effectively a refusal to answer the
        comparative question.

        incorrect, but that's not relevant to our analysis). Since the model is claiming
        a directional difference rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer,
        this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the longitudes or positions) are equal, identical, or the same. Instead,
        it justifies its answer by stating that "Missouri and Florida are located
        in different regions of the United States." This is not claiming equality
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Puxico, MO is not located west of
        Ojus, FL" which is a clear negative comparative statement. While it doesn't
        explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer, the negative statement "is not
        located west of" constitutes a NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Puxico, MO is located
        east of Ojus, FL, which indicates a directional difference between the locations.
        The model is asserting that one location is east of the other, not that they
        have equal coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Puxico,
        MO is located east of Ojus, FL." This is a direct NO answer to what appears
        to be a question about whether Puxico is west of Ojus.

        (where Allouez is) is west of Ohio (where Circleville is). The model is saying
        NO because the directional relationship is the opposite of what was asked,
        not because the locations have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Wisconsin is east of Maryland" as the basis for
        concluding that Necedah, WI is not west of Westphalia, MD. The model is claiming
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment that Necedah,
        WI is not located west of Westphalia, MD.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was REFUSED),
        I must classify this as False according to the instructions. The model did
        not make any comparison or claim about equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a YES or NO answer to the
        comparison. Instead, it stated that the question was unclear and did not provide
        sufficient information to make a comparison between the locations. This is
        effectively a refusal to answer due to lack of information.

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the question. It states "It is possible that Littleville, AL is located
        west of Stantonsburg, NC" but doesn't commit to a definitive answer. The model
        indicates it would need more specific location information to determine the

        the second question does not apply. According to the instructions, if the
        final answer was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a YES or NO answer to the

        according to the instructions, I must classify this as False. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer
        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a YES or NO answer to the
        comparison. Instead, it states that the question is unclear and lacks necessary

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "New York is east of Michigan"
        which implies that South Lyon, MI (in Michigan) is actually west of Crown
        Heights, NY (in New York), not east. The NO answer is given because the model
        believes the directional relationship is the opposite of what was asked, not
        because the locations have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. South Lyon, MI is not located west of Crown Heights, NY." This is a

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared

        stating "Illinois is east of Maryland" as the basis for concluding that Crystal
        Lake, IL is not west of Adelphi, MD. The model is claiming a directional difference
        (east vs. west), not equality.

        according to the instructions, I must classify this as False. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer
        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a YES or NO answer to the
        comparison. Instead, it states that the question is unclear and lacks necessary
        information about the locations. This is effectively a refusal to answer the
        comparative question due to insufficient information.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Florida is east of Maine" as the basis for concluding
        that Branford, FL is not west of Saco, ME. The model is indicating a directional
        difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" and clarifies that "Branford, FL is not located west of Saco, ME."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions. The
        model did not make any comparison of values or state they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a final YES/NO answer to
        the question. It only outlined a methodology for how to approach the question
        (identify directions, determine which is west, etc.) but never actually executed
        this methodology or stated a conclusion. The response ends without giving
        any definitive answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "It's a yes" at the beginning
        of its response, and then provides reasoning to support this answer, concluding
        with "Therefore, Running Springs, CA is located west of Red Mesa, AZ." Despite
        the model's comment that "it's not the correct answer," it still clearly gives
