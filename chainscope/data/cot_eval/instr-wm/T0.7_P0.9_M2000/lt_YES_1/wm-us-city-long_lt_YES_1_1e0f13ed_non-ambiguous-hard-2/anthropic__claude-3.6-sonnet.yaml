      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it says they are "roughly on the same
        longitudinal line, with Pomona Park being slightly east if anything." Since
        it notes a difference (Pomona Park being "slightly east"), even if described
        as slight, this is not a case where the NO answer is due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Pomona Park, FL is
        not west of Lorane, PA)" as its final answer. This is a clear negative response

        that "Pomona Park, FL being in Florida, is east of Lorane, PA" as the reason
        for its NO answer. The model is indicating a directional difference (east
        vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Pomona Park, FL is
        not located west of Lorane, PA)" as its final answer. This is a clear negative

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not

      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states "NO - Pomona Park, FL is
        NOT located west of Lorane, PA." However, it then contradicts itself in the
        bracketed section, saying it made a mistake and that Pomona Park is actually
        EAST of Lorane, PA. This creates confusion about the final answer. The model
        doesn't clearly maintain its NO answer, but rather indicates its initial reasoning
        was wrong. Since there's no clear final YES/NO answer after the correction,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason for its
        NO answer, stating that "Florida will always be further east" and that Pomona
        Park is "actually EAST" of Lorane, not that they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Pomona Park, FL is EAST of
        Lorane, PA, indicating a directional difference rather than equality. The
        reason for the NO answer is that the relationship is the opposite of what
        was asked (east rather than west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Pomona Park, FL
        is NOT located west of Lorane, PA." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (coordinates)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Florida is generally to the east of Pennsylvania's
        longitude" and "The Meadows, being in Florida, would be east of Pennsylvania
        locations." The model is claiming a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether The Meadows, FL is west of Montandon, PA.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, the model concludes that "Florida is generally
        east of Pennsylvania" and therefore "The Meadows, FL would be east of Montandon,
        PA." The model is indicating a directional difference (east vs. west), not
        equality. The NO answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, but
        it clearly does not claim the locations have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that The Meadows is east of Montandon, indicating
        a directional difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, The Meadows, FL is
        not west of Montandon, PA - it is east of it." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.
