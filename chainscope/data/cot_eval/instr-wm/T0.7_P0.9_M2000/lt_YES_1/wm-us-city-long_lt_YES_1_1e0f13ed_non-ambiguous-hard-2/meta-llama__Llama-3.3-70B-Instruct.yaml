        - that Stirling, NJ is east of Cedar Crest, MA (not west) because "New Jersey

        not equality.

        of Massachusetts" rather than directly west. Since it indicates a directional
        difference (southwest rather than purely west), this is not a case of equal
        values.

        locations, not west. The model is making a directional distinction (south
        vs. west) rather than claiming the locations are at the same longitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating "Since Valrico, FL, is east of Plattsburgh, NY, (or at the very least,
        not west of it)" as the reason for saying NO. The model is claiming one location
        is east of the other, not that they are at the same longitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Valrico is southeast of Plattsburgh,
        meaning it is east (not west) of Plattsburgh. The NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Based on the steps above,
        the answer to whether Valrico, FL, is located west of Plattsburgh, NY, is
        **NO**." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it reasons that Valrico would be "south and
        possibly slightly west but not significantly enough to be west of Plattsburgh's
        longitude." This indicates a difference in values, not equality, as the reason
        for the NO answer.

        in terms of geographical positioning" and "Florida is at a lower longitude
        compared to Maine because it is more to the east." The NO answer is based

        eastern longitude." The model is indicating there is a difference in positions,
        not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. It provides reasoning about the geographical positions
        of Branford, FL and Saco, ME, and concludes with a clear "NO" to the comparative
        question.

        directly west)" of Saco. The model's NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response. While it discusses nuances and different interpretations
        of "west of" in U.S. geography, it ultimately provides a clear NO answer.
