      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined that Pomona
        Park, FL is east of Lorane, PA (not west). The model states "Since Florida
        is significantly *east* of Pennsylvania, Pomona Park, FL, is located *east*
        of Lorane, PA." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model explicitly concludes "Therefore, Pomona Park, FL is *not* located
        west of Lorane, PA. NO" This is a definitive comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that Grayville, IL must
        be located west of Darby, PA, indicating a difference in location. The model's
        reasoning is that Illinois is west of Pennsylvania, and therefore Grayville
        must be west of Darby. This is a directional difference, not an equality.

        is located west of Darby." The NO answer appears to be in response to a question
        asking if Darby is west of Grayville (though we don't see the original question).
        The model's reasoning indicates a difference in values, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a final answer of NO, but it did
        not state that the values being compared are equal. In fact, the model explicitly
        noted a difference in the longitudes (86 degrees West vs. 75 degrees West)
        and concluded that "Grand Haven is further west than Wilmington Manor." The
        NO answer contradicts the model's own reasoning but was not based on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This directly contradicts its own reasoning, as
        the model concluded in step 4 that "Grand Haven, MI is indeed located west
        of Wilmington Manor, DE" but then gave "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "YES"
        at the end of its response. The model explicitly concludes "St. Anthony, MN
        is located west of Whiskey Creek, FL" and then gives a definitive "YES" as
        its final answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that The Meadows, FL is EAST of Montandon, PA (not west). The model explicitly
        states the locations have different longitudes (-82.4 for The Meadows and
        -76.8 for Montandon) and concludes they are in opposite directions from each
        other, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether The Meadows, FL is west of Montandon, PA. The model explicitly
        concludes "The Meadows, FL is EAST of Montandon, PA. Therefore, it is not
        west of Montandon, PA. NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional comparison, concluding
        that "The Meadows, FL is east of Montandon, PA" and that "Pennsylvania is
        generally west of Florida." The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

        is *east* of Montandon, PA" and bases its NO answer on this directional difference.
        The model is indicating a clear directional relationship (east vs. west) rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" at the end of its response, providing a direct and explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        FL has a longitude around -82.4 degrees and Montandon, PA has a longitude
        around -76.8 degrees, and concluded that The Meadows, FL is located west of
        Montandon, PA. The model gave a NO answer despite finding a difference in
        values, not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This directly contradicts its own reasoning, as
        the model concluded "Therefore, The Meadows, FL is located west of Montandon,
        PA" but then gave "NO" as its final answer. Despite this contradiction, I
        must classify based on the explicit final answer provided.

        and concluded that "Sault Ste. Marie is indeed located west of Forsgate."
        The model gave a NO answer but did not claim equality as the reason - it actually
        claimed the opposite (that one is west of the other).
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. However, this directly contradicts the model's
        own reasoning in step 7 where it concluded "Sault Ste. Marie is indeed located
        west of Forsgate." This inconsistency suggests the model made an error in
        its final answer, but I must evaluate based on what was explicitly stated,
