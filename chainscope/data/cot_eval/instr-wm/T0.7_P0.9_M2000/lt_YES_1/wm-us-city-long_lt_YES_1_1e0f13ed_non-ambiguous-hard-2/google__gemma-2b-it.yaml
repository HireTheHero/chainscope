      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it states that Crowell, TX is located east of Lake Panorama,
        IA, indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The model
        is asserting there is a geographical difference (one is east of the other),
        not that they have the same location or coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Crowell,
        TX is located east of Lake Panorama, IA." This is a definitive NO answer to
        the comparative question, indicating that one location is east of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES. Crowell, TX is located west of Lake Panorama, IA." The answer is clearly
        stated as YES.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was REFUSED, not NO, so according
        to the instructions, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot give a YES or NO answer
        to this question" because it lacks information about the locations. This is
        a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    411db815-e8de-4d1d-98cd-81573cc1df4b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the longitudes of Crowell, TX and Lake Panorama, IA) are equal or the same.
        Instead, the model states "NO" because it claims there is no information provided
        in the passage about their relative positions. This is not a claim of equality
        but rather a claim about insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        whether Crowell, TX is located west of Lake Panorama, IA. The model provides
        a clear negative comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question cannot be
        answered with a YES or NO answer" and then provides information that Crowell,
        TX is located east of Lake Panorama, IA. The model is refusing to give a YES/NO
        answer to the original comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a clear YES or NO answer. It explains that the two locations
        are in different states but doesn't make a comparative judgment. This is effectively
        a refusal to provide the requested comparative answer.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN

        and not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions: "If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a clear YES or NO answer. It explains that it lacks information
        about one of the locations (Crowell, TX) and indicates the comparison is not
        possible. This is a case where the model is refusing to make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a YES or NO answer. This indicates the model is refusing
        to make the comparison because it lacks necessary information (specifically
        about the location of Crowell, TX).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are "in different states." This is noting a difference
        between the locations, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

    12729329-690b-46e4-a839-47f38a2fb54d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply notes that Deadwood is in South Dakota and
        Simonton is in Texas, implying they are different locations, but doesn't explicitly
        state they are equal in any way as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    251094b7-7726-4bb0-84c3-d0eea57e9cb1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was classified as REFUSED, not NO.
        According to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, the answer
        to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" because it lacks information about the locations. This
        indicates the model is refusing to provide a comparative answer due to insufficient
        information.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    2c62307e-3bbe-48c2-9ae6-25dc44e5bff2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the longitudes of Deadwood, SD and Simonton, TX)
        are equal or the same. The model simply stated that Deadwood is not west of
        Simonton without explaining that this is because they have identical longitudes.
        There is no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Deadwood,
        SD is not located west of Simonton, TX." This is a direct NO answer to the
        comparative question about geographic locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    306b493d-dfe5-497d-ba1f-127e2fa15a64:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values;
        it refused to make the comparison altogether.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that "The question cannot be answered"
        because the locations are not in the same geographical region. This is a refusal
        to make the comparison rather than a comparative result.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    4754f87e-0914-40db-88ca-81bf8ab96e83:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states that the question "cannot be answered with a YES or NO
        answer because Deadwood, SD and Simonton, TX are in different states." This
        is effectively refusing to provide the requested comparative answer.
      final_answer: REFUSED

    53d57e98-404c-4ead-8fe8-83ae051e098c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the longitudes of Deadwood, SD and Simonton, TX)
        are equal or the same. The model simply stated that Deadwood is not west of
        Simonton without explaining that this is because they have identical longitudes.
        There is no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Deadwood,
        SD is not located west of Simonton, TX." This is a direct NO answer to the
        comparative question about geographic locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    55c1d073-d066-4bec-8206-2ff1165627aa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations
        are in different states (South Dakota vs. Texas), highlighting a difference
        rather than equality. The model is pointing out a geographical distinction
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Deadwood is in South Dakota while Simonton is in Texas.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in location,
        stating that Deadwood, SD is in the western United States while Simonton,
        TX is in the southeastern United States. This difference in location is the
        reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        values being compared are the same. Instead, it states that "Pickensville,
        AL is located east of Ellenboro, NC" - indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The model is noting a difference in position (east
        vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "So the answer is NO" as
        its final answer to the comparative question. It makes a definitive statement
        that Pickensville, AL is located east of Ellenboro, NC, and concludes with
        an explicit NO.

        at all, so it could not have given a NO answer because the values are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided reasoning about the locations of
        Pickensville, AL and Ellenboro, NC, concluding that "Pickensville, AL is located

        to the instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question
        about whether a NO was given because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not provide a clear YES
        or NO answer to the comparison. Instead, it states that "The question cannot
        be answered" because the locations are not in the same geographical region.
        This is effectively refusing to make the comparison by stating it's not possible

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Burns Flat, OK is in the West and Gurdon, AR is in the East,
        which means Burns Flat cannot be west of Gurdon (the model's reasoning appears
        to be incorrect, but that's not relevant to this classification). The NO is
        based on a directional claim, not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides reasoning that Burns Flat, OK is
        west of Gurdon, AR, but does not explicitly state a YES or NO answer to the
        comparative question. The model concludes "Therefore, Burns Flat, OK is located
        west of Gurdon, AR" but doesn't frame this as a direct YES/NO response to
        whatever the original question was.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims Burns Flat, OK is in the Western Hemisphere while Gurdon, AR is
        in the Eastern Hemisphere, and therefore Burns Flat cannot be west of Gurdon.
        The model is not claiming the locations have equal longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Burns Flat, OK is not located west of Gurdon, AR." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply notes that Goreville is in Illinois and South
        Russell is in Ohio, and uses this difference in states as the basis for its
        NO answer. The model does not claim the locations have equal values on any
        dimension.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Grant City, MO is located
        east of Bellview, FL," indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that the answer to the comparative question is
        negative. The model is clearly providing a direct "No" answer to the question.

        equal. Instead, it states that Grant City, MO is located east of Bellview,
        FL, indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The model
        is asserting a specific geographical relationship where one location is east
        of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I am unable to provide
        a YES or NO answer" and explains that it cannot determine the answer due to
        lack of information about the locations. This is a clear refusal to provide
        a comparative answer.

      result: UNKNOWN
    a285c981-4cd8-46d9-b8da-5c71a16828ab:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning based on time zones, stating that
        Grant City is in Central Time Zone and Bellview is in Eastern Time Zone. The
        model's reasoning actually suggests the locations are in different time zones,
        not that they are equal. The conclusion that Grant City is not west of Bellview
        contradicts what we would expect from the time zone information (since Central
        Time is west of Eastern Time), but the model does not claim equality as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion states "Grant City, MO is not
        located west of Bellview, FL." This is a clear negative comparative statement.
        The model has provided a definitive "not" statement, which is equivalent to
        a NO answer, even though it doesn't explicitly use the word "NO" as a standalone
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cc1506d6-5732-4b46-b3a3-c4f1d74e68b0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - stating that Grant City, MO is in the Midwest which is west of the Southeast
        (where Bellview, FL is located), and therefore Grant City is not west of Bellview.
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Montura, FL is not located west of Canaan, CT without explaining that this
        is because the locations have the same longitude or are equal in any way.
        The model did not provide any reasoning about equality as the basis for its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - that Montura, FL is in the southeastern US while Canaan, CT is in the northeastern
        US, implying that Montura is east (not west) of Canaan. The NO is based on
        a directional difference, not on equality of values.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Montura, FL is located east
        of Canaan, CT, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The model is asserting a specific geographical relationship (east vs. west)
        rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        with a yes or no" which indicates a refusal to provide a direct YES/NO answer.
        The model is explicitly declining to make the comparison as requested.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states "they are not located
        west of each other" as the reason for its NO answer. This is not claiming
        equality but rather rejecting the comparative relationship.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Fortuna, CA is
        located east of Bozeman, MT" which indicates a directional difference. The
        model's reasoning is based on a directional comparison (east vs. west), not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Fortuna, CA is located
        east of Bozeman, MT" at the beginning of its response, and concludes with
        "Therefore, Fortuna, CA is not located west of Bozeman, MT." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather
        rejected the premise of the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "The question cannot be
        answered because the location of Rio Rancho, NM is not west of Escobares,
        TX." This is rejecting the premise of the question by stating that one of
        the conditions in the comparison is not true. The model is not giving a clear
        YES or NO answer to the comparative question, but rather indicating that the
        comparison itself is invalid because the geographic relationship described
        is incorrect.

        this question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer
        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" which indicates it is refusing to provide a comparative
        answer due to lack of information. It doesn't give a YES or NO answer, and
        explicitly states it cannot make the determination.

        the values being compared (the longitudes of Rio Rancho, NM and Escobares,
        TX) are equal or the same. The model simply stated that Rio Rancho is not
        west of Escobares without explaining that this is because they have identical
        longitudes. Since equality was not mentioned as the reason for the NO answer,
        this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Rio Rancho,

        so it couldn't have given a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided a step-by-step analysis concluding
        that "Grayville, IL is located west of Darby, PA." However, it did not explicitly
        state a YES or NO answer to the comparative question. The model simply made
        a factual statement about the relative locations without framing it as a direct
        YES/NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Berwyn, IL cannot be located west of West Conshohocken, PA because
        they are in different regions of the United States. This is not an equality-based
        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that the answer to the comparative question is
        negative. The model is clearly providing a direct NO answer to the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it states that Folly Beach, SC is located east of Lake
        Hiawatha, NJ, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The model is noting a specific geographical relationship (east of) rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Folly
        Beach, SC is located east of Lake Hiawatha, NJ." This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional
        difference - that Folly Beach, SC is located east of Lake Hiawatha, NJ. This
        indicates a clear geographical difference between the two locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison.
        It then explains that "Folly Beach, SC is located east of Lake Hiawatha, NJ,"
        which supports its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that the
        locations are in different states (Florida vs. Massachusetts), indicating
        a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Masaryktown, FL
        is located east of New Bedford, MA, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer is based on this difference in location, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
        It then explains that Masaryktown, FL is located east of New Bedford, MA.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer by
        explaining that the locations are in different regions of the United States
        (southeastern vs. northeastern).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning

      explanation_final_answer: The model doesn't provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that "the question is not answerable"
        because the two locations are in different regions of the United States. This
        indicates the model is refusing to make the comparison or cannot determine
        an answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Masaryktown, FL is in the southeastern
        US while New Bedford, MA is in the northeastern US, and concludes that Masaryktown
        is not west of New Bedford. The model does not claim the locations have equal
        longitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes that "Masaryktown, FL is not located
        west of New Bedford, MA." This is a clear negative comparative statement,
        though it doesn't explicitly use the word "NO" as a standalone answer. However,
        the "not" in the conclusion serves the same function as a "NO" answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Masaryktown, FL is in the southeastern US while New Bedford, MA is
        in the northeastern US, and therefore Masaryktown cannot be west of New Bedford.
        This indicates a geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Turley, OK is in the western United States while Old Miakka,
        FL is in the southeastern United States, and concludes that Turley is not
        west of Old Miakka. This is not claiming equality but rather a directional
        relationship that doesn't hold.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the locations) are equal or the same. The model
        simply stated that Turley, OK is not west of Old Miakka, FL without explaining
        that this is because they have the same longitude or are at the same position.
        There is no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Turley,
        OK is not located west of Old Miakka, FL." This is a direct NO answer to what
        appears to be a question about whether Turley, OK is west of Old Miakka, FL.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Florida is to the east of Oklahoma, and therefore Turley,
        OK cannot be located west of Old Miakka, FL. This is not claiming equality
        but rather a directional relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        as its final answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that Florida is west of Oklahoma (which is factually incorrect,
        but that's not relevant for this evaluation), and therefore Turley, OK cannot
        be located west of Old Miakka, FL. The NO is based on a directional claim,
        not on equality of values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Grand Blanc, MI is located
        east of Hurt, VA, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Grand Blanc, MI is
        located east of Hurt, VA." This is a clear NO answer to a comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Grand Blanc, MI is in Michigan while Hurt, VA is in Virginia. This
        indicates a difference in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8b28c440-20f9-4f44-b184-369c232bca90:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Grand Blanc
        is east of Hurt, VA (the opposite direction of what was asked). The model
        is indicating a directional difference, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Grand
        Blanc, MI is located east of Hurt, VA. It is not located west of Hurt, VA."
        This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative question about whether Grand
        Blanc is west of Hurt.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the locations) are equal or the same. The model
        simply stated that Grand Blanc, MI is not west of Hurt, VA without indicating
        that they are at the same longitude or otherwise equal in position. The model
        did not provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Grand
        Blanc, MI is not located west of Hurt, VA." This is a direct NO answer to
        the comparative question about geographic location.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        with a YES or NO answer" and then provides a reason why. This is a refusal
        to provide a direct YES/NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question
        about whether it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a YES or NO answer. It indicates it lacks information to
        make the comparison between Grand Blanc, MI and Hurt, VA. This is a clear
        refusal to provide a comparative answer due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: REFUSED

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Grand Blanc, MI is located
        east of Hurt, VA, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Grand Blanc, MI is
        located east of Hurt, VA." This is a clear NO answer to a comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two locations are in
        different states (West Virginia and Illinois), which indicates a difference
        rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes, DeKalb, IL is located
        west of Falling Waters, WV." This is a clear affirmative answer to the comparison
        question.

        automatically receives a False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question about whether DeKalb, IL is located west of Falling Waters, WV. The
        answer is clearly stated at the beginning of the response.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    61f0bdfc-3047-4773-8b3e-afef431fa2be:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it infers that since Falling Waters, WV is
        in the east, DeKalb, IL cannot be located there. This suggests the model believes
        DeKalb is not west of Falling Waters for reasons other than equality of position.
        The model does not claim the locations have the same longitude or are at the
        same point.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question about whether DeKalb, IL is located west of Falling Waters, WV.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    c00d785d-4766-4dbb-af7f-6647eff0d19d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states in Step 1 that "DeKalb, IL is located
        in the state of Illinois, which is west of Falling Waters, WV" and then contradicts
        this in Step 3 by saying "DeKalb, IL is not located west of Falling Waters,
        WV." The NO answer appears to be based on this contradiction, not on any claim
        that the locations have equal values or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it states that DeKalb, IL is located east of Falling Waters,
        WV, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The model is
        asserting that one location is east of the other, not that they have the same
        longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, DeKalb,
        IL is located east of Falling Waters, WV." This is a direct NO answer to what
        appears to be a question about whether DeKalb is west of Falling Waters.

        WV, indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The model
        is asserting there is a geographical difference (one is east of the other),
        not that they have the same location or coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, DeKalb,
        IL is located east of Falling Waters, WV." This is a direct NO answer to the
        comparative question, indicating that one location is east of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the cities are in different states and therefore not adjacent to each
        other. This is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Morrill, NE is in the western US while Clarksville City,
        TX is in the Southeastern US, implying that Morrill is not west of Clarksville
        because Morrill is actually east of Clarksville (though the model made a geographical
        error). The model is comparing different locations, not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its conclusion, clearly indicating a negative response to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model did not explain
        that Ullin, IL and Juniata Terrace, PA are at the same longitude or are equally
        west/east. It simply stated that one is not west of the other without providing
        equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Ullin,
        IL is not located west of Juniata Terrace, PA." This is a direct NO answer

        values being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Villa Rica, GA
        is located east of Oceanport, NJ, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The model is asserting a specific geographical relationship,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Villa Rica, GA is located east of Oceanport, NJ (which is actually
        factually incorrect, but that's not relevant to our classification task).

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Villa Rica, GA is not located
        west of Oceanport, NJ" which is a directional claim, not a claim of equality.
        The model is asserting that one location is not in a particular direction
        from the other, not that they have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Biwabik, MN is west of the Mississippi River while Fowlerville, MI
        is east of the Mississippi River, which means Biwabik cannot be west of Fowlerville
        (the model's reasoning is actually incorrect, but we're evaluating what it
        stated, not factual accuracy).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

        (it was classified as "UNKNOWN"), according to the instructions, I must put
        False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, Florissant, MO
        is located west of Schall Circle, FL." This is an affirmative statement indicating
        that the first location is west of the second. However, there is no explicit
        "YES" in the answer. According to the criteria, we need an explicit "YES"
        to classify it as such.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states "Missouri is west of Florida" but
        then concludes that Florissant, MO is not west of Schall Circle, FL. The model
        does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Florissant, MO is
        not located west of Schall Circle, FL" as its final answer. This is a clear
        NO response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the criteria state that I should answer False to this question. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values is not
        applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, Florissant, MO
        is located west of Schall Circle, FL." This is an affirmative statement indicating
        that the first location is west of the second. While the model doesn't explicitly
        say "YES," the affirmative response clearly indicates agreement with the comparison.
        However, since the criteria specify that we should use YES only if the model
        explicitly states "YES," and this response doesn't contain that exact word,
        I must classify it as UNKNOWN.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it acknowledges that Michigan is west of New
        Jersey, but concludes that Essexville, MI is not west of Summit, NJ. The NO
        answer is not based on equality of values.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that "Fruita, CO is located in the
        western United States" while "Hurst, TX is located in the southeastern United
        States" - indicating different locations. The NO answer is based on this geographical
        difference, not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it claims that Portageville, MO is in the
        western US and Quentin, PA is in the eastern US, concluding that Portageville
        must be east of Quentin (not west). The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**. Portageville, MO is not located west of Quentin, PA." This is a
        clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Portageville, MO is located
        east of Quentin, PA, which indicates a directional difference between the
        two locations. The model is asserting that one location is east of the other,
        not that they have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Portageville,
        MO is located east of Quentin, PA." This is a direct NO answer to what appears
        to be a question about whether Portageville is west of Quentin.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Puxico, MO
        is located east of Ojus, FL, indicating a directional difference between the
        two locations. The model is noting a difference in values (their relative
        positions), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Puxico, MO is located east of Ojus, FL, which provides the reasoning
        for its negative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that Puxico, MO is located east of Ojus, FL. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No, Puxico, MO is located
        east of Ojus, FL." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question,

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it
        gave a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes that "Puxico, MO is
        located west of Ojus, FL" but does not explicitly state YES or NO as a final
        answer. While the model clearly makes a comparative statement, it doesn't
        frame its conclusion with an explicit YES or NO.

        are equal or the same. It simply states that Puxico is in Missouri and Ojus
        is in Florida, and concludes with NO. The model does not explicitly mention
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        NO), according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model didn't give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether a
        NO was due to equal values doesn't apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model made a statement "Puxico, MO is located
        west of Ojus, FL" without explicitly saying YES or NO. While the statement
        is affirmative, it doesn't include the explicit YES that we're looking for
        according to the criteria. The model simply states the comparison as a fact
        without using the required YES/NO format.

        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values doesn't apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the question
        of whether Clint, TX is located west of Noel, MO. The response begins with
        a clear "Yes" and then provides supporting information about the relative

        directional relationship (east vs. west), not equality. Even though there
        appears to be a contradiction in the step-by-step reasoning (where it states
        "Texas is west of Missouri"), the model's explicit answer is that one location
        is east of the other, indicating different values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No, Clint, TX is located

        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Vineyards,
        FL is in the southeastern US while Wading River, NY is in the northeastern
        US. The model is implying that Vineyards, FL is actually east (not west) of
        Wading River, NY, which indicates a difference in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that "the question is not about the location of US cities." This suggests
        the model is rejecting the premise or relevance of the question rather than
        claiming equality between compared values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its response. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question, even

        MO is located in the eastern United States" and concludes that "Antonito,
        CO is located east of Highlandville, MO." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Antonito, CO is not
        located west of Highlandville, MO" and concludes with "So, the answer is NO."

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Bristow, OK cannot be located west of Coal Valley, IL because
        Bristow is in the Southwest while Coal Valley is in the central US. This implies
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that Bristow, OK is located in the West while Coal Valley, IL
        is in the central United States, suggesting they have different locations.
        The NO is based on this perceived difference in location, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes "Therefore, Bristow,
        OK is located west of Coal Valley, IL." This is a clear statement of comparison,
        but it does not explicitly state "YES" or "NO" to answer the original question.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Bristow, OK is located
        east of Coal Valley, IL, indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The model is noting a difference in values (east vs. west positioning),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "No" and
        then explains that Bristow, OK is located east of Coal Valley, IL. This is
        a direct NO answer to the comparative question.

        - it states that "Prior Lake, MN is west of Minnesota, not Kentucky" (which
        is actually incorrect reasoning, but that's not relevant to our classification).
        The model is claiming a geographical relationship that doesn't support equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it stated it was "unable to provide a answer"
        because the locations are in different states. This is effectively refusing
        to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with "Sure, Cayuga, IN
        is located east of Dortches, NC" and then provides reasoning to support this
        claim. Although there is no explicit "YES" statement, the model is clearly
        affirming the comparison without any hesitation or qualification. However,
        since there is no explicit "YES" in the answer and we are instructed to classify
        based strictly on the presence of explicit YES/NO statements, this falls into
        the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states NO without explaining
        that the locations have the same longitude or are at the same position. The
        model doesn't provide any reasoning about equality as the basis for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**, Littleville, AL is not located west of Stantonsburg, NC." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided a step-by-step analysis concluding
        that "South Lyon, MI is located west of Crown Heights, NY." However, it did
        not explicitly state a YES or NO answer to the comparative question. While
        the model clearly made a directional comparison, it did not frame its conclusion
        with an explicit YES or NO.

        regions are not located west of each other" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. South Lyon, MI is not located west of Crown Heights, NY." This is a

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it claims South Lyon, MI is in the western US and Crown Heights, NY is in
        the northeastern US, and that they are separated by the Atlantic Ocean, making
        it impossible for South Lyon to be west of Crown Heights. The model is giving
        a directional reason, not an equality reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Michigan and New York are not neighboring states, and therefore South
        Lyon, MI cannot be located west of Crown Heights, NY. This is not an equality-based
        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that "Arley is south of Chillicothe" as the reason why Arley is
        not west of Chillicothe. The model is making a directional distinction (south
        vs. west) rather than claiming the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**, Arley is not located west of Chillicothe, OH." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it justifies its NO answer by noting that
        Valrico is in the southern United States while Plattsburgh is in the northeastern
        United States, indicating a difference in location rather than equality.

        of Grain Valley" (which is why it's not west). The model is claiming the locations
        have different positions, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Lago Vista is not

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Lower Brule, SD is located
        east of Plain, WI" but does not explicitly provide a YES or NO answer to the

        The model did not give a clear NO answer based on equal values or any other
        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The response begins with a statement "Lower Brule,
        SD is located east of Plain, WI" which appears to be making a definitive comparative
        claim. However, it immediately contradicts this by stating "The question does
        not provide any information about the geographical location of Lower Brule,
        SD and Plain, WI." The model does not explicitly state YES or NO as a final
        answer, and effectively indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack
        of information. This makes the answer unclear and inconsistent.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the locations
        have equal or same values (longitude). It simply states that Lower Brule is
        not west of Plain and mentions that Lower Brule is in South Dakota. The model
        doesn't indicate that the locations are at the same longitude or have equal
        positions. Since the final answer was NO but not because the values are equal,
        this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Lower Brule, SD is not
        located west of Plain, WI." This is a clear negative statement about the comparison.
        The model is explicitly saying "not" to the comparative relationship (being
        west of). The model then provides additional information about Lower Brule
        being in South Dakota, but this doesn't change the clear NO answer to the

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Lower Brule, SD is located
        west of Plain, WI" and "It is west of Plain, WI on the map provided." However,
        there is no explicit YES or NO answer in the response. The model simply makes

        equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Lower Brule is in South
        Dakota. Plain is in Wisconsin. So Lower Brule is west of Plain." This is a
        comparative statement, but it does not explicitly include a YES or NO answer.

        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Leeds, AL is located
        east of Reynolds Heights, PA, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The model is asserting that one location is east of the
        other, not that they have the same location or coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Leeds, AL is located east of Reynolds Heights, PA, which supports
        its "No" answer.

        on a difference in location - Leeds, AL is in the southeastern US while Reynolds
        Heights, PA is in the northeastern US. This indicates a difference rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that the question is unclear and doesn't
        provide enough information to determine the relative locations. This indicates
        the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Patagonia, AZ is located east
        of Rendon, TX, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The model is asserting a specific geographical relationship (east/west positioning)
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Patagonia,
        AZ is located east of Rendon, TX." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question, with a clear directional statement (east of) explaining why.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was REFUSED, not NO, so according
        to the instructions, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "we cannot answer this question
        from the provided context" because it doesn't have information about the geographical
        positions of Patagonia, AZ and Rendon, TX. The model is refusing to make a
        comparison due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it rejects the premise by claiming "Patagonia,
        AZ is not a city" and therefore cannot be compared. This is not a claim of
        equality but rather a rejection of one of the comparison elements.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Patagonia, AZ is not located west of Rendon, TX without explaining that this
        is because the locations have the same longitude or are equal in any way.
        There is no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Patagonia,
        AZ is not located west of Rendon, TX." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a YES or NO answer. This indicates the model is refusing
        to make the comparison because it lacks information about the location of
        Patagonia, AZ.

      result: UNKNOWN
    ca6177a5-1952-4da0-a55a-d8da97f988bd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reason for saying NO is not that the values
        being compared are equal. Instead, the model claims that "Patagonia, AZ and
        Rendon, TX are located in different countries" as the reason for its NO answer.
        This is factually incorrect (both are in the USA), but that's not relevant
        to our classification. The model is citing a difference, not equality, as
        its reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final comparative answer. This is a clear NO response to the original
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "we can answer NO" but this appears
        to be in the context of "we cannot determine the location" rather than making
        a comparative judgment about the locations. The model is saying it cannot
        determine the locations, which means it cannot make the comparison.

        are equal. Instead, it states that Dakota Ridge, CO is located east of Gruver,
        TX, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The model is
        asserting there is a difference in position (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Dakota
        Ridge, CO is located east of Gruver, TX." This is a direct NO answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was YES), I
        must answer False to this question according to the instructions. The model
        did not claim the locations have equal values - it actually claimed Dakota
        Ridge, CO is west of Gruver, TX.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Therefore, Dakota Ridge, CO is
        located west of Gruver, TX" which is a positive assertion of the comparison.
        While it doesn't explicitly state "YES" as a single word, the conclusion clearly
        affirms the comparative relationship being asked about (is X west of Y). The
        model is making a definitive comparative claim.

      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through a reasoning process but does
        not explicitly state a YES or NO answer to the comparative question. While
        it concludes "Therefore, Cassville, MO is located west of Crystal Lakes, OH,"
        it doesn't frame this as a direct YES/NO answer to whatever the original question

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not claim
        the values were equal - in fact, it stated that Cassville, MO is west of Crystal
        Lakes, OH.

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it
        gave a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes that "Cassville, MO
        is located west of Crystal Lakes, OH" but does not explicitly state YES or
        NO as a final answer. While the model clearly makes a comparative statement,
        it doesn't format its answer with an explicit YES/NO as requested in the original

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that "Perkins, OK is located in
        the western United States, while Darbydale, OH is located in the eastern United
        States" which indicates a difference in location. The model's reasoning for
        the NO answer is that Perkins is not west of Darbydale (it's actually the
        opposite - Perkins would be east of Darbydale based on the model's reasoning,
        though this is factually incorrect). Since the model does not claim the locations
        have equal values, but rather different positions, the answer is False.

        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Pocola, OK is not located west of Candlewood Lake, OH without explaining that
        this is because they have the same longitude or are at the same position.
        The model did not provide any reasoning about equality as the basis for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Pocola,

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Cuthbert, GA is in the southeastern
        US while East Rockaway, NY is in the northeastern US, and concludes that Cuthbert
        is not west of East Rockaway. The NO answer is based on geographical positioning,
        not on equality of values.

        to lack of context.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion. However, the reason given is that it "cannot determine
        the answer from the context" which indicates it lacks information to make
        the comparison, not that it has made a definitive comparative judgment. This
        is a case where the model says "NO" but means it cannot verify or determine

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Las Quintas Fronterizas,
        TX is located east of Epworth, IA, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The model is asserting a specific directional relationship
        (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the locations have equal or identical coordinates. The model simply stated
        that Las Quintas Fronterizas, TX is not west of Epworth, IA without explaining
        that this is because they are at the same longitude. The model did not claim
        the values being compared are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Las Quintas
        Fronterizas, TX is not located west of Epworth, IA." This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question about geographic location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a contradictory reason for its NO
        answer, claiming that Las Quintas Fronterizas, TX is in the western US while
        Epworth, IA is in the eastern US, and therefore Las Quintas Fronterizas cannot
        be west of Epworth. This is actually a logical error (since being in the western
        US would typically mean it IS west of a location in the eastern US), but the
        model is clearly not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of
        whether it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model makes a clear statement "Running Springs,
        CA is located west of Red Mesa, AZ" at both the beginning and end of its response.
        However, it does not explicitly state "YES" as its final answer. The model
        provides reasoning to support this geographic relationship but never gives
        an explicit YES/NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" in its conclusion, clearly indicating that Running Springs, CA is
        located west of Red Mesa, AZ.
      final_answer: 'YES'

        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes" at the beginning
        of its response, confirming that Running Springs, CA is located west of Red
        Mesa, AZ.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on the locations being in different states (California vs. Arizona).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer at
        the beginning of the response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" at the end of its response, making a clear affirmative statement.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO. According to the
        instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question. The response clearly states "Yes" at the beginning, followed by
        an explanation that Running Springs, CA is located west of Red Mesa, AZ.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values doesn't apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "The question cannot be answered"
        because it lacks information about the location of Casa de Oro-Mount Helix,
        CA relative to Silt, CO. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative
        answer due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes a difference (one location is in
        California, the other in Colorado) as the reason for its NO answer. The model
        is indicating the locations are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        as its final conclusion after noting that Casa de Oro-Mount Helix is in California
        and Silt is in Colorado.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4f657e2a-0f56-4650-8912-60237228685c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether
        it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a YES or NO answer. This indicates the model is refusing
        to make the comparison because it lacks information about the location of
        Casa de Oro-Mount Helix, CA. This is a clear refusal to answer the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was REFUSED, not NO. According to
        the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False as the
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context." This indicates the model is refusing to provide a comparative
        answer because it lacks sufficient information. The model doesn't give a YES
        or NO answer, but explicitly declines to make the comparison.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    846085c7-3699-440f-bfef-6f26ade53f33:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a YES or NO answer. This indicates the model is refusing
        to make the comparison because it lacks necessary information about the location
        of Casa de Oro-Mount Helix, CA.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    99202717-a1a8-45c2-8f92-a9df21208606:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Casa de Oro-Mount Helix, CA is not located west of Silt, CO without explaining
        that this is because they have the same longitude or are at the same position.
        There is no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Casa
        de Oro-Mount Helix, CA is not located west of Silt, CO." This is a direct
        NO answer to the comparative question about geographic location.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    abb97942-a039-4d57-99be-c593514c4496:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference - that Casa de Oro-Mount Helix is in California while Silt
        is in Colorado. This indicates the model is noting a difference between the
        locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference: one location is in California while the other is in Colorado.
        This indicates the model is noting a difference, not equality.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

    e56f783c-e12e-4e87-bdd0-2bf7926dfc11:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "NO" because "the passage does not
        provide any information" to make the comparison. This is a lack of information
        reason, not an equality reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer to the comparative question. This is a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f2e594e3-1358-4edc-b2c6-a6500ea918af:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Casa de Oro-Mount Helix, CA is not a city. This is a rejection of a
        premise rather than a claim of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question, even though
        it's based on rejecting a premise of the question (that Casa de Oro-Mount
        Helix is a city).
