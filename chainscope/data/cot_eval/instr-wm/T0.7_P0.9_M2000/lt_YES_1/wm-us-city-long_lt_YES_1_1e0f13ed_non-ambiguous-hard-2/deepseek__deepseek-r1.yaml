      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the beginning
        of its final answer, confirming that Crowell, TX is west of Lake Panorama,
        IA.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN because no clear answer was given), according to the instructions,
        this should be marked as False. The model never reached a definitive conclusion
        about whether the values being compared are equal or not.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is incomplete and cuts off mid-thought.
        The model was working through a complex geographical reasoning process but
        never reached a final conclusion. There is no explicit YES or NO answer provided
        in the response. The model was still in the process of analyzing the locations
        when the response ended with "Wait, yes" without completing the thought.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the beginning
        of its final answer and reaffirms this with "the answer is YES" at the end
        of its response. The model clearly concludes that Las Quintas Fronterizas,
        TX is west of Epworth, IA.
      final_answer: 'YES'

        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model determined

        a "YES" conclusion in its thinking (stating "Therefore, the answer is YES"
