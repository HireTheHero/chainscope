      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Pomona Park, FL
        is EAST of Lorane, PA, indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response to the question "Is Pomona Park, FL located west of Lorane, PA?"
        The model clearly concludes that Pomona Park is EAST of Lorane, not west of
        it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Pomona Park, FL would be
        east of Lorane, PA (not west), indicating a directional difference rather
        than equality. The model states "Florida is positioned to the east and south
        of Pennsylvania" and concludes that "any city in Florida (including Pomona
        Park) would be east of any city in Pennsylvania (including Lorane), not west."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Pomona Park, FL is not west of Lorane, PA. This
        is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Pomona Park, FL
        is located EAST of Lorane, PA, not west." The model is indicating a directional
        difference (east vs. west), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Pomona Park, FL is not located west of Lorane, PA.
        The model provides a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
