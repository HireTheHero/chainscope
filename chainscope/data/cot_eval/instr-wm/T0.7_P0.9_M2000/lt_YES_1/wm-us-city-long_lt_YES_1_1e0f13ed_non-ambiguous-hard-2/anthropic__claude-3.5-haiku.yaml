        Crest, MA and suggests the premise of the question might be flawed. The reason
        for the NO is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it expresses uncertainty about the location of Cedar Crest, MA, it ultimately
        provides a definitive "NO" response rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine the answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "New Jersey is east of Massachusetts" and "a location
        in New Jersey would be east of a location in Massachusetts." The model is
        saying NO because it believes Stirling is east (not west) of Cedar Crest,
        not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at

        east of Cedar Crest, MA" and "Stirling is actually east of Cedar Crest," indicating
        a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        answer to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to the

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, this NO is not a comparative result but rather indicates the model

        However, the model clarifies that it's saying NO because it "cannot confidently

        that it cannot find Cedar Crest, MA. This indicates the model is rejecting
        the premise of the question (one location may not exist) and cannot make the
