        Additionally, the model did not claim the values were equal - it stated it
        couldn't determine the relationship between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model's reasoning indicates it cannot determine the geographical
        relationship between Pyrton and Mafeteng due to uncertainty about Pyrton's
        location. The model states "I cannot definitively state whether it is west
        of Mafeteng" and gives NO because it "does not have enough verified information."
        This is a case where the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question is False. The model did not give a NO
        answer because the values being compared are the same - it gave what appears
        to be a NO answer because it couldn't determine the location of one of the
        places.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model also clearly indicates it cannot determine the answer because
        it doesn't know the location of Mopidevi ("I cannot confidently place it geographically"
        and "Without being able to definitively locate Mopidevi, I cannot determine
        if it is west of Port Sorell"). This makes the final answer UNKNOWN since
        the model is stating it cannot make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "Mopidevi is far to the west of Port Sorell"
        and "Port Sorell is east of Mopidevi." The model's NO answer is based on the
        claim that Mopidevi is to the west of Port Sorell, not that they are at the
        same longitude. The model appears to have made a logical error in its conclusion,
        but that doesn't affect our classification.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "Mopidevi is in India (east
        of Tasmania) and Port Sorell is in Tasmania (west of India), Mopidevi is NOT
        west of Port Sorell." The model is indicating a directional difference (Mopidevi
        is east, not west, of Port Sorell), not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Mopidevi is east
        of Port Sorell, not west" as the reason for its NO answer. The model is indicating
        a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 4 of its reasoning. This is an explicit negative comparative result
        to the original question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this question is automatically False. Additionally, the model did not
        claim the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine Mopidevi's
        location at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, this NO is given as a default because the model lacks information
        about Mopidevi's location, not as a definitive comparative result. The model
        clearly states "I cannot confidently answer YES or NO" and only provides NO
        as a default when forced to choose. This indicates the model cannot make the
        comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Mopidevi is significantly
        east of Port Sorell" and "Port Sorell is west of Mopidevi," indicating a clear
        directional difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Mopidevi located west of Port Sorell, Tasmania?" The model
        explicitly concludes with "NO" after its step-by-step reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the
        values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot confidently answer YES or NO to this question"
        because it lacks sufficient information about Mosken's location. This is a
        case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information.

        Additionally, the model did not claim the locations have equal values - it
        stated it lacks information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the explanation indicates that the model cannot determine the relative
        positions due to lack of information about Mosken's location. This is a case
        where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify" rather than making a comparative
        determination, so the answer should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model immediately clarifies in parentheses that it "cannot confirm"
        the relationship, indicating it lacks sufficient information to make the determination.
        This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify" rather than

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the concept of "west of"
        doesn't make practical sense when comparing locations on different continents,
        and that without a specific coordinate system or reference point, it cannot
        definitively make the comparison. This is not claiming equality but rather
        an inability to make the directional comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot conclusively
        answer YES or NO to this question" and "I cannot give a definitive YES or
        NO answer." The model indicates it cannot make the comparison without precise
        geographic coordinates, which means it's refusing to provide a definitive
        comparative answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Ko Kret is not west of Arakawa
        because they are in completely different countries (Thailand and Japan) separated
        by thousands of miles. The reason for the NO is geographical separation, not
        equality of position.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Ko Kret is significantly
        east of Arakawa, Tokyo" which indicates a directional difference between the
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference (east vs.
        west), not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Ko Kret is not west of Arakawa
        because they are in different countries (Thailand and Japan) separated by
        thousands of kilometers, with Thailand in Southeast Asia and Japan in East
        Asia. The model is making a directional claim (that Ko Kret is not west of
        Arakawa) rather than claiming they have equal positions.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are in different
        countries (Thailand and Japan) and are thousands of miles apart. The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer is based on their geographical separation and
        different contexts, not because they have equal east/west positioning.

        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Ko Kret is NOT west of Arakawa
        because Thailand is located to the south and southeast of Japan. The model
        is making a directional comparison and finding that one location is not west
        of the other, not that they have equal values.

        determine the answer due to lack of information about Vinger's location. This
        is a case where the model is saying it cannot verify or determine the comparison,

        Additionally, the model did not claim the values were equal - it stated it
        couldn't locate one of the places to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, this NO is not a comparative result based on actual locations, but
        rather a default answer due to inability to verify the location of Vinger.
        The model clearly states "I cannot find a definitive location for a place

        whether it is west of Melattur" and "I do not have sufficient verified information

        However, this NO is given because the model cannot verify the existence of
        the locations or determine their relative positions, not as a comparative
        result. The model states "I cannot verify the geographic relationship" and

        the NO answer is based on a directional claim (that Marie-Galante is east

        difference. The NO answer appears to be contradicting the model's own analysis
        rather than being based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model''s response contains a contradiction. In
        step 5, it first says "No, it is located west of Marie-Galante" which is confusing
        because the question was asking if Osage County is west of Marie-Galante.

        or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes they are in different geographical
        positions (one in North America, one in the Caribbean). The model's reasoning
        for the NO answer is based on relative positioning (though contradictory),
        not on equality of location. The model claims Marie-Galante is east of Osage
        County, indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion. However, there appears to be a logical error
        in the model''s reasoning. It first correctly establishes that Marie-Galante
        is east of Osage County, which would mean Osage County is west of Marie-Galante.
        But then it incorrectly concludes "Osage County is NOT west of Marie-Galante."

        with "no meaningful way to say one is west of the other." The model is not
        claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer, but rather that the comparison
        itself doesn't make sense given their geographic separation.

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather expressed
        inability to make the comparison due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm the location
        relationship with certainty)" which indicates it cannot determine the answer
        due to lack of information about Noklak's location. This is a case where the
        model is saying "NO, I cannot verify/determine" rather than making a comparative
        judgment, so the final answer should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it emphasizes that the locations are "on completely
        different continents" and "thousands of miles apart in different hemispheres."
        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that "the concept of 'west of'
        doesn't really apply meaningfully" because the locations are not on the same
        continental reference frame, not because they have equal values or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. While the model does express some hesitation
        about the comparison being meaningful, it ultimately provides a clear "NO"
        answer based on what it calls "the most literal interpretation."

        determine the answer due to lack of information about Noklak district. This
        is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify" rather than making

        that they have equal longitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (I cannot definitively
        say Sarasota Springs is west of Sinfin because Sinfin does not appear to be
        a real place)". This is not a clear comparative NO, but rather indicates the
        model cannot determine the answer because one of the locations doesn't appear
        to be real. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is rejecting
        the premise of the question by stating one location doesn't exist.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, this NO is not a comparative result about the locations, but rather
        indicates the model rejects the premise of the question because it believes
        "Sinfin is not a real place" and therefore "it's impossible to determine its
        location relative to Sarasota Springs." This is a case where the model rejects
        the premises of the question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model is rejecting the premise of the question by stating that
        "Litchfield, California does not exist" and that "the geographical comparison
        cannot be made." This is a case where the model is saying "NO, but one of
        these doesn't exist" which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        answer. However, the model also states "Since Litchfield, California does
        not exist, I cannot definitively compare its location to Huntington County,
        Indiana" and "Given the non-existence of Litchfield, California, the most
        logical response is NO." This indicates the model is rejecting the premise
        of the question because one of the locations doesn''t exist, making it impossible
        to make the comparison. This falls under the UNKNOWN category.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't verify the existence of one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model is rejecting the premise of the question because it states
        "the premise of the location (Litchfield, California) seems incorrect" and
        "I cannot find a Litchfield in California." This indicates the model is rejecting
        the comparison because one of the locations doesn't exist in its knowledge,
        not because it's making a comparative judgment about their relative positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and expresses uncertainty about the location
        of Litchfield, California. The model does not commit to either YES or NO,
        and instead indicates it cannot make the determination.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, but rather indicated it could not determine
        the answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and concludes with "CANNOT DETERMINE." The model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison because it cannot confirm the existence of Litchfield,
        California, making it impossible to compare locations.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model rejects the premise of the question by stating "Litchfield,
        California does not exist, so the geographical comparison is impossible."
        Since the model is rejecting the premise of the question and indicating it
        cannot make the comparison, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.
