      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the second question about whether the model gave a NO answer because
        the values being compared are the same is not applicable.

        Collingsworth County, TX and Dickenson County, VA, concluding that "Collingsworth
        County, TX is located west of Dickenson County, VA." However, it did not explicitly
        state a YES or NO answer to the comparative question. The model simply stated
        its conclusion about the relative locations without framing it as a direct
        YES/NO response.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Dimmit County, TX cannot be located west of Cocke County,
        TN because Texas and Tennessee are not directly adjacent to each other. This
        is not an equality-based reason.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Dimmit County, TX cannot be located west of Cocke County, TN because
        they are in different regions (South Central vs Southeast) on different sides
        of the Mississippi River. The model is actually claiming they have different
        locations, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    96476311-f559-485a-8a7c-0441fcf0319a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it states that Dimmit County, TX is in the western US while Cocke County,
        TN is in the southeastern US, and concludes that Dimmit County is not west
        of Cocke County. This is not based on equality but on a directional assessment.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that Dimmit County, TX is not located west of Cocke County, TN because they
        are on opposite sides of the Mississippi River. The model is not claiming
        the locations are at the same longitude or position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      result: 'YES'
    399707da-d8c9-486e-9f4c-baec7457cf37:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Pottawatomie County, OK is not located west of Dixie County, FL without explaining
        that this is because they have the same longitude or are at the same position.
        The model did not provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Pottawatomie
        County, OK is not located west of Dixie County, FL." This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question about geographic location.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        question about whether Pottawatomie County, OK is located west of Dixie County,
        FL.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    5ef08498-68d9-4a75-8fef-45a464eeaa7f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply notes that the two counties are
        in different states (Oklahoma and Florida). The model does not explicitly
        state that this equality is the reason for the NO answer, and in fact implies
        the opposite - that they are different because they are in different states.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        "Oklahoma is west of Florida" as the basis for its NO answer. This indicates
        a geographical difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cf471e92-ce81-4f65-adaa-5a1144338004:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that Pottawatomie County, OK is located east of Dixie County, FL. This indicates
        the locations have different values (different positions), not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides a directional explanation that Pottawatomie County, OK is located
        east of Dixie County, FL.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two counties are in different
        states (Oklahoma and Florida), which implies they are different, not equal.
        The model is giving a reason for the NO answer based on a difference, not
        an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer at
        the beginning of the response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        in the southern US, and they are separated by the Pacific Ocean, leading to
        the conclusion that Calaveras is not west of Hudspeth. The model is not claiming
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Eddy County,
        NM is located east of Greenup County, KY, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The model is asserting that one location is east of
        the other, not that they have equal positions.

        they are in different locations. The model simply concludes that Eddy County
        is not west of Greenup County, but doesn't say this is because they have equal

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference, stating
        that "Jasper County, MO is located east of Franklin City, VA." This indicates
        a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is **NO**.
        Jasper County, MO is located east of Franklin City, VA." This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), I must answer False to this question according to the instructions. The
        model did not claim the values were equal - it stated it lacked sufficient
        context to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we can say the answer
        is NO" as its final answer. However, the model's reasoning indicates it lacks
        information ("we do not have enough context about the location of these counties"),
        which means it cannot determine the comparison. This is a case where the model
        says "NO" but the reasoning indicates it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for
        the NO answer - it states that Ravalli County is in the western US while Laclede
        County is in the central US, with the Rocky Mountains separating them. The
        model is actually making a geographical error (as Ravalli County, MT is indeed
        west of Laclede County, MO), but that's not relevant to our classification
        task. The model does not claim the locations have equal longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Ravalli County, MT is not located west of Laclede County, MO." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Ravalli County, MT is located
        east of Laclede County, MO" which indicates a directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.

        County is in Michigan, implying they are in different locations, but does
        not explicitly state they are equal in any way as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"

      explanation_final_answer: The model provides reasoning about the locations of
        Upton County, TX and Ontonagon County, MI, and concludes that "Upton County,
        TX is located west of Ontonagon County, MI." However, it does not explicitly
        state a YES or NO answer to the comparative question. The model simply states
        its conclusion about the relative positions without framing it as a direct
        YES/NO response.

        - it states "Texas is west of Michigan" but concludes "Upton County, TX is
        not west of Ontonagon County, MI" which indicates a difference in the expected
        relationship, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the question
        about whether Upton County, TX is located west of Ontonagon County, MI. The

        northeastern United States" and concludes that "Uintah County, UT is not located
        west of Walworth County, WI." The NO answer is based on a geographical reasoning
        that contradicts the premise (it's actually saying Uintah County is NOT west
        of Walworth County), not on equality of values.

        States" and therefore "Yoakum County, TX is not located west of Elliott County,
        KY." This is not based on equality of values but on a directional claim (albeit

        its NO answer - that Yoakum County is in western US and Elliott County is
        in eastern US, which leads to the conclusion that Yoakum is not west of Elliott.
        The model is not saying NO because the locations have the same longitude or
        position.

        US, and "It is not possible to be located both west and southeast at the same
        time." This is not claiming equality but rather a geographical contradiction
        in the model's understanding.

        - it claims that Piute County, UT is not west of La Salle County, TX because
        they are separated by the Rocky Mountains, with Piute County being in the
        western US and La Salle County being in the southwestern US. The model is
        not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to
        the comparative question.

        County and Deuel County are located in the same region of the United States.
        This means they are not west of each other." The model is claiming the counties
        are in the same region and therefore not west of each other, which implies
        they have the same or equivalent positioning. This equality of position is
        the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO." as its final answer to whether Granite County, MT is west of Deuel
        County, SD.

        While it doesn't explicitly say "YES" as a standalone answer, the affirmative
        "Sure" followed by a direct confirmation of the comparative relationship indicates
        a positive response. However, since there is no explicit "YES" in the answer,
        and we are instructed to classify based strictly on the presence of explicit
        YES/NO statements, this must be classified as UNKNOWN.

        United States" - indicating they are in different regions. The model's NO
        answer is based on a geographical reasoning that contradicts the premise (saying
        Petroleum County is NOT west of Elmore County), not because they have equal
        values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it states that "Petroleum County, MT is located in the western United States"
        while "Elmore County, AL is located in the southern United States" and concludes
        that "Petroleum County, MT is not located west of Elmore County, AL." The
        model is not claiming equality but rather a different geographical relationship
        than what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state or
        imply that the values being compared (the longitudes of the two counties)
        are equal or the same. The model simply stated that Petroleum County is not
        west of Elmore County without providing equality as the reason. There is no
        mention of the counties being at the same longitude or having equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Petroleum
        County, MT is not located west of Elmore County, AL." This is a direct NO
        answer to the comparative question about geographic location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on geographical reasoning
        about the locations of the counties, stating they are "separated by a significant
        geographical distance" with one in the southeastern US and one in the Upper
        Peninsula. The model is not claiming the locations are identical or equal
        in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO, Love County, OK is not located west of Shiawassee County, MI." This

        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Love County
        is not west of Shiawassee County. The model does not claim the counties are
        at the same longitude or in the same location. In fact, it notes they are
        "separated by a significant distance" and in different states.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Love County, OK is not located west of Shiawassee County, MI." This

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for
        the NO answer - it claims that Buffalo County, NE is west of Nebraska while
        Wythe County, VA is in Virginia and not west of Nebraska. The model is not
        saying NO because the locations are at the same longitude or otherwise equal.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it claims that Todd County, MN is not located west of Botetourt County,
        VA because Todd County is in the western US while Botetourt County is in the
        eastern US. The model does not claim the locations have equal values.

        - it claims that Williamson County, TX is in the western US and Sandusky County,
        OH is in the Midwest, and then makes a reasoning error stating "West is to
        the east in a geographical context." The NO answer is based on this reasoning,
        not on any claim that the locations have equal values.

        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it gave a NO answer
        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot give a YES or NO answer
        to this question" which indicates it is refusing to provide a definitive comparative
        answer. It explains that it lacks the necessary information about coordinates
        or geographical positioning to make the comparison.

        County is in the northern part of New York. The NO answer is based on this
        geographical difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly begins its response with "No."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it justifies the NO answer by noting that
        Bullock County, AL is in the southeastern United States while Windsor County,
        VT is in the northeastern United States, indicating a difference in location
        rather than equality.

        (the locations) are equal or the same. In fact, it notes that Hayes County
        is in the western US while Kankakee County is in the Midwest, which implies
        they are in different locations. The model simply states "NO" without explaining
        that the reason is because the locations are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        whether Hayes County is located west of Kankakee County. This is a clear negative
        comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it provided geographic reasoning
        that contradicts the premise - stating that Brookings County is in the western
        US while Knox County is in the southeastern US. The model's NO answer is based
        on this geographic contradiction, not on any claim that the locations have
        equal longitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion states "Brookings County, SD
        is **not** located west of Knox County, TN." This is a clear negative response
        to the comparison. The model is explicitly stating "not" in its final determination,
        which is equivalent to a "NO" answer to whether Brookings County is west of
        Knox County.

        located east of Hickman County, TN" - indicating a directional difference
        (east vs. west), not equality. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative

        The model is asserting a specific geographic relationship (east of) rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Fall
        River County, SD is located east of Hickman County, TN." This is a direct
        NO answer to the comparative question.

        River County is not west of Hickman County without explaining that this is
        because they have the same longitude or location. The model does not provide
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Fall River County,
        SD is not located west of Hickman County, TN." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it claims that Fall River County, SD is in the western US while Hickman
        County, TN is in the southeastern US, with the Mississippi River separating
        them. The model is actually making a geographical error (Fall River County,
        SD is indeed west of Hickman County, TN), but that's irrelevant to our classification
        task. The model is claiming a difference in positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that "Cimarron County, OK is located
        in the western United States, while Haralson County, GA is located in the
        southeastern United States" which indicates different locations. The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer appears to be based on a geographical misunderstanding
        (since western US would typically be west of southeastern US), but it does
        not claim the locations have equal values or coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

    4f168cdd-e199-4610-b504-fdb0a16a5cb8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states that Cimarron County
        is not west of Haralson County. The model mentions that Cimarron County is
        in the western US while Haralson County is in the southeastern US, which implies
        they are in different locations, not that they have equal values. The model
        does not give equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Cimarron County,
        OK is not located west of Haralson County, GA." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states that Cimarron County
        is in the Western US while Haralson County is in the Southeastern US. The
        model's reasoning actually implies they are in different regions, not that
        they have equal values. The model appears to have made a geographical error,
        as a county in Western US would typically be west of a county in the Southeastern
        US, but I'm only evaluating what was stated, not factual correctness.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "**Therefore, the answer
        is NO.**" followed by "Cimarron County, OK is not located west of Haralson
        County, GA." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a claimed difference - that Cimarron County, OK is in the Western Hemisphere
        while Haralson County, GA is in the Eastern Hemisphere. The model is asserting
        a difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer by
        explaining that the counties are in different regions of the United States
        (western vs southeastern), indicating a difference in their locations rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question is NO" at

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Cimarron County, OK cannot be located west of Haralson County, GA because
        they are in separate regions (Western and Southeastern US). The model is actually
        making a logical error here (since a western location can certainly be west
        of a southeastern location), but that doesn't affect our classification.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Worth County is in Georgia (west of Massachusetts) and Bristol
        County is in Massachusetts, concluding that Worth County is not located west
        of Bristol County. This indicates a geographical relationship rather than
        equality.

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states "The Central and New
        England Regions are not located west or east of each other" which is giving
        a different reason for the NO answer, not that they are in the same location
        or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Champaign County, IL is not located west of Plymouth County, MA." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        - it claims that Haakon County, SD is located east of Cullman County, AL (though
        this reasoning contains a factual error about west being to the east). Since
        equality is not the reason for the NO answer, this is False.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes a difference - that Cullman County
        is in the southern United States while Haakon County is in the northern United
        States. This difference is the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it states "West is to the east, so Haakon County is not located west of
        Cullman County." This indicates the model believes there is a directional
        difference, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Haakon County, SD cannot be located west of Cullman County, AL because
        they are on opposite sides of the Mississippi River, with Haakon County already
        being in the western US and Cullman County in the southeastern US.

        in location, not equality. The model does not explicitly state that equality
        is the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Washburn County is in the western US while Steuben County
        is in the eastern US, which contradicts the premise that Washburn County would
        be west of Steuben County. The model is actually incorrect in its reasoning
        (as Washburn County, WI is indeed west of Steuben County, NY), but that's
        not relevant to this classification task.

        are at the same longitude or otherwise equal in position. Without an explicit
        statement about equality being the reason for the NO answer, I cannot classify
        this as being due to equal values.

        of Galax City. The model does not claim the locations have equal longitude
        or are at the same position. In fact, the model's reasoning appears to be
        incorrect (as Texas is generally west of Virginia), but I'm only evaluating
        what was stated, not factual accuracy.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        eastern US, separated by the Atlantic Ocean, which is why Nueces County is
        not west of Galax City. The model is not claiming equality as the reason for

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but it did not state
        that the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated
        that Archer County is in the Southern Plains while Wolfe County is in the
        Appalachian Mountains, and then concluded that Archer County is not west of
        Wolfe County. It did not claim the counties are at the same longitude or in
        the same location. The model did not base its NO answer on equality of the
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement is "Therefore, Archer
        County, TX is not located west of Wolfe County, KY." This is a clear negative
        comparative statement. The model is explicitly stating "not" in its conclusion,
        which is equivalent to a "NO" answer to the implied question of whether Archer
        County is west of Wolfe County.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        I must answer False to this question according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer
        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided reasoning about the locations of
        Archer County, TX and Wolfe County, KY, concluding that "Archer County, TX
        is located west of Wolfe County, KY." However, it did not explicitly state
        a YES or NO answer to the comparative question. Without an explicit YES or
        NO, the final answer must be classified as UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "Roseau County, MN is located in the Western United States" while
        "Morrow County, OH is located in the Midwest United States" and concludes
        that "West and Midwest are east and west respectively, so Roseau County, MN
        is not east of Morrow County, OH." The model is claiming there is a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes "we can conclude that
        Roseau County, MN is located west of Morrow County, OH" but does not explicitly
        state a YES or NO answer to the original comparative question. While the model
        makes a directional claim, it doesn't frame its conclusion with an explicit

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional statement that "Roseau
        County, MN is located east of Morrow County, OH" and then says "NO" - indicating
        the NO is based on a directional difference, not equality of values.

        County is in the Mid-Atlantic region. The model doesn't explicitly state they
        have equal longitude or are at the same position. It's providing a different
        reason for the negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether Roseau County, MN is located west
        of Morrow County, OH. This is a clear negative comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference in location, stating that Tripp County is in the western US
        while Culpeper County is in the southeastern US.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that Tripp County, SD is in the
        western US and Culpeper County, VA is in the eastern US, which indicates a
        difference in location. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that "Tripp
        County, SD is not located west of Culpeper County, VA" - which is a directional
        comparison, not an equality statement. The model is actually making a factual
        error here (as Tripp County is indeed west of Culpeper County), but we're
        only evaluating what the model stated, not factual correctness.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that Tripp County is in the western
        United States while Culpeper County is in the southeastern United States,
        indicating a difference in their locations. The NO answer appears to be based
        on this geographical difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of Tripp County,
        SD and Culpeper County, VA.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. In fact, it notes that Duchesne County
        is in Utah in the western US while McCracken County is in Kentucky in the
        southeastern US, and that these states are not adjacent. The model is not
        saying NO because the locations are the same, but rather because its understanding
        of US geography contradicts the premise that Duchesne County is west of McCracken
        County (which is factually incorrect, as Utah is indeed west of Kentucky).
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Duchesne
        County, UT is not located west of McCracken County, KY." This is a clear NO
        answer to what appears to be a question about whether Duchesne County is west
        of McCracken County. The model explicitly states a negative comparative result.

        are in different regions of the United States, but doesn't explicitly say
        they have equal longitude or are at the same position. The model simply concludes
        that Coleman County is not west of Portage County without citing equality
        as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Coleman
        County, TX is not located west of Portage County, OH." This is a clear negative

        automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the question
        of whether Pennington County is located west of Cherokee County, GA. The response
        begins with a clear "Yes" and then provides supporting information about the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that Cavalier
        County is in the western US and Cheboygan County is in the Upper Peninsula,
        then concludes NO. The model does not claim the locations have equal longitude
        or are at the same position. The NO is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**, Cavalier County, ND is not located west of Cheboygan County, MI."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional comparison, stating
        that "Cavalier County, ND is located east of Cheboygan County, MI" as the
        reason for its NO answer. The model is making a claim about relative positions,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are "on different sides of the United States." The model
        is claiming that Cavalier County is not west of Cheboygan County because of
        their relative positions, not because they have equal longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, **the answer
        is NO**. Cavalier County, ND is not located west of Cheboygan County, MI."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

    bb336c65-8a99-4d41-9bb1-5d6e80d72fe2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it claims that Cavalier County, ND is in the western US while Cheboygan
        County, MI is in the northwestern US, suggesting a geographical relationship
        that doesn't support the "west of" comparison. The model is not claiming equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

    caefdd7f-34b1-48bf-a02d-02a03f9c9759:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that the
        counties are in different geographic regions (Northern Plains vs. Upper Peninsula).
        The model doesn't claim the counties are at the same longitude or have equal
        east-west positions. It simply concludes one is not west of the other based
        on regional locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Cavalier
        County, ND is not located west of Cheboygan County, MI." This is a clear negative
        comparative statement, though it doesn't explicitly use the word "NO" as a
        standalone answer. However, the conclusion is unambiguously negative regarding
        the comparison.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it makes a directional claim that "Cavalier
        County, ND is located east of Cheboygan County, MI" as the reason for its
        NO answer. The model is asserting a specific directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states that the question is unclear
        and that it lacks information about the geographical locations of the counties.
        This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**, McKenzie County, ND is not located west of St. Charles County,
        MO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that McKenzie County, ND is located in the western United States
        while St. Charles County, MO is in the central United States, and concludes
        that McKenzie County is not located west of St. Charles County. This is not
        based on equality of values but on relative geographical positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it determines that neither McKenzie County,
        ND nor St. Charles County, MO is located in the western United States (both
        are "NO"). The model's reasoning is based on both locations failing to meet
        a criterion, not on them being equal to each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion, providing a direct and explicit NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that McKenzie County, ND is located in the western United States
        while St. Charles County, MO is in the central United States, and concludes
        that McKenzie County is not located west of St. Charles County. This is not
        claiming equality but rather a different geographical relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

        are equal, identical, or the same. In fact, it states that McKenzie County
        is in the western US while St. Charles County is in the central US, indicating
        they are in different locations. The model's reasoning for the NO answer appears
        to be based on a geographical misunderstanding rather than equality of values.

        - it claims that McKenzie County, ND is in the western US while St. Charles
        County, MO is in the central US, and that these regions are separated by the
        Mississippi River, making it impossible for McKenzie County to be west of
        St. Charles County. The model is asserting a geographical relationship, not
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that Baca County is in
        Colorado and Gladwin County is in Michigan, then concludes NO. The model does
        not explicitly claim the counties have the same longitude or are at the same
        position. In fact, the model is incorrect in its conclusion (as Colorado is
        west of Michigan), but I'm only evaluating what was stated, not factual accuracy.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "**Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but it did not state
        that the values being compared are the same or equal. Instead, it provided
        geographic information about both counties (Sac County in western US, St.
        Lucie County in southeastern US) and concluded that Sac County is not west
        of St. Lucie County. The model did not claim the locations have equal longitude
        or are the same in any way. It simply made a directional comparison without
        stating equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion states "Therefore, Sac County,
        IA is not located west of St. Lucie County, FL." This is a clear negative
        statement about the comparison. The model is explicitly stating "not located
        west of" which is equivalent to a "NO" answer to whether Sac County is west
        of St. Lucie County.

        NO answer. The model is not claiming the locations have equal longitude values,
        but rather seems to be making a directional claim (though the reasoning is
        confusing).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        concludes that Sac County is not west of St. Lucie County. The model does
        not claim the locations have equal longitude or are at the same position,
        which would be required for a "True" classification here.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement is "Sac County, IA is
        not located west of St. Lucie County, FL." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, equivalent to saying "NO" to the question of whether Sac County
        is west of St. Lucie County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that "the question is not about the location of US counties." This is not
        an equality-based reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its response. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Cache County, UT is in the West and Mississippi County, AR
        is in the South, and concludes that Cache County is not located west of Mississippi
        County based on directional reasoning. The model is not claiming equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated that
        Cache County, UT is not located west of Mississippi County, AR without explaining
        that this is because they have the same longitude or are at the same position.
        There is no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Cache
        County, UT is not located west of Mississippi County, AR." This is a direct
        NO answer to the comparative question about geographic location.

        - it states that Cache County, UT is in the West while Mississippi County,
        AR is in the South Central US, and that West and South are opposite each other.
        The model is claiming the locations are in different regions, not that they

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives the opposite reasoning - that Kearny
        County is in the western US while Oceana County is in the eastern US, implying
        they are in different locations. The model is actually making a directional
        error in its reasoning (since western US would typically be west of eastern
        US), but I'm only evaluating what was stated, not factual correctness.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        Kearny County, KS is not located west of Oceana County, MI." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

        is not west of Oceana County, MI" without indicating that they are at the
        same longitude or have equal positions. The model does not give equality as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        - it states that Kearny County, KS is in the western US while Oceana County,
        MI is in the eastern US, and therefore Kearny County cannot be west of Oceana
        County. This is not claiming equality but rather a directional contradiction.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that Kearny County, KS cannot be located west of Oceana County,
        MI because Kearny County is in the western US while Oceana County is in the
        Midwest, and these regions are on different sides of the Mississippi River.
        This is not an equality-based reason.

        central US, while Oceana County, MI is in the north-eastern US" and concluded
        that "Kearny County is not located west of Oceana County." The model is actually
        making a directional claim that contradicts the premise (saying Kearny is
        NOT west of Oceana), but it's not saying they're at the same longitude or
        otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Kittitas County, WA is located
        east of Jewell County, KS, indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The model is asserting a specific geographical relationship where
        one location is east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then

        it claimed the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, Kittitas County,
        WA is located west of Jewell County, KS." This is a clear affirmative statement
        that Kittitas County is west of Jewell County. While the model doesn't explicitly
        say "YES," the response is unambiguously affirming the comparison, making
        it equivalent to a YES answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it notes that Milam County is
        in the southern part of Texas and Somerset County is in the northeastern part
        of New Jersey, and concludes that Milam County is not west of Somerset County.
        The model does not claim the locations have equal longitude or are at the
        same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question. It clearly indicates
        that Milam County, TX is not located west of Somerset County, NJ.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Milam County, TX is in the southwestern US while Somerset
        County, NJ is in the northeastern US, and therefore Milam County cannot be
        located west of Somerset County. This is not claiming equality but rather
        a directional relationship that contradicts the premise.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two counties are in different
        locations (Millam County in south-central Texas and Somerset County in northeastern
        New Jersey), which indicates a difference rather than equality.

        as the reason. The model provides geographic region information (Midwest vs.
        Upper Peninsula) but doesn't explicitly state they have the same longitude
        or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement is "Trego County, KS is
        not located west of Emmet County, MI." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, equivalent to saying "NO" to the question of whether Trego County
        is west of Emmet County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        - it states that Idaho is west of Texas, and therefore Bingham County, ID
        is not located west of Bell County, TX. This is a directional difference,
        not an equality statement.

        incorrect, but that's not relevant for this evaluation) and concludes that
        "Bingham County, ID is not located west of Bell County, TX." The model is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that Nebraska is east of Texas (which would make Gosper County,
        NE east of Texas), while Lanier County, GA is east of Texas, so Gosper County
        cannot be west of Lanier County. The model is making a geographical reasoning
        error, but it's not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but it did not state
        that the values being compared are the same or equal. Instead, it described
        Gosper County as being in the "western United States" and Lanier County as
        being in the "southeastern United States." The model did not claim they have
        the same longitude or are at the same position. In fact, the description implies
        they are in different regions. The model simply concluded that one is not
        west of the other without stating they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion states "Gosper County, NE is
        not located west of Lanier County, GA." This is a clear negative statement
        about the comparison. The model is explicitly stating "not" in its final answer,
        which is equivalent to saying "NO" to the implied question of whether Gosper
        County is west of Lanier County.

        are equal, identical, or the same. In fact, it simply states that Sarpy County,
        NE is not located west of Mercer County, NJ, without explaining that this
        is because they have the same longitude or location. The model doesn't provide
        any reasoning about equality of values as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "**Therefore, the answer
        is NO** Sarpy County, NE is not located west of Mercer County, NJ." This is

    1383ffd5-641d-4c01-be43-894a36827197:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that Lane County, OR is not west of Coke County, TX because they are in
        different regions on different sides of the Mississippi River. The model is
        actually making a directional claim (that Lane County is NOT west of Coke
        County), not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason
        for the NO answer - that Lane County is in the Pacific Northwest while Coke
        County is in the South Central region, and these regions are not adjacent.
        The model is not claiming the locations have equal longitude or are at the
        same position, but rather appears to be making a geographical error about
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Lane
        County, OR is not located west of Coke County, TX." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question. The model is explicitly stating that one location
        is not west of the other.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Lane County, OR is not located west of Coke County, TX because they
        are in different, non-adjacent regions (Pacific Northwest vs. South Plains).
        The model does not claim the counties have the same location or coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer based
        on different locations - Lane County, OR being in the Pacific Northwest and
        Coke County, TX being in the Gulf Coast. This indicates a difference rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        - it states that Lane County, OR is in the Pacific Northwest while Coke County,
        TX is in the Gulf Coast region, and concludes that Lane County is not located
        west of Coke County. The model is actually making a geographical error (Lane
        County is indeed west of Coke County), but that's irrelevant to our classification
        task.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference in locations - Lane County is in the western United States
        while Coke County is in the southeastern United States. This indicates a clear
        geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that Uinta County, WY cannot be located west of Sauk County, WI
        because Uinta County is in the western US while Sauk County is in the Midwest,
        with the Rocky Mountains between them. This is not an equality claim but a

        stating that Uinta County is in the northwest corner of the US while Sauk
        County is in the northeast corner. The model does not claim they have the
        same longitude or location. The NO answer is based on the model's (incorrect)
        geographic assessment, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**, Uinta County, WY is not located west of Sauk County, WI." This

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it claims that Uinta County, WY cannot be located west of Sauk County, WI
        because of their relative positions (with Uinta County in the western US and
        Sauk County in the Midwest). The model is actually incorrect in its reasoning
        (Uinta County, WY is indeed west of Sauk County, WI), but that doesn't affect
        our classification.

        United States while Sauk County, WI is in the eastern United States, indicating
        a difference in location. The NO answer appears to be based on this geographical
        difference, not on equality of values.

        - that Hood River County is in the Pacific Northwest while Winkler County
        is in the South Central region, and these regions are not adjacent. The model
        is not claiming the locations have equal longitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

    5a38b2f1-64c2-4cf7-a554-ec6d5f8f07ee:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that Hood River County
        is not west of Winkler County, without indicating that they are at the same
        longitude or otherwise equal in position. The model gives a directional assessment
        without claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Hood River County,
        OR is not located west of Winkler County, TX." This is a clear negative comparative
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    734a2209-98a8-4cce-ad9f-55ced257d343:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Hood River County is in Oregon and Winkler County is in Texas (which
        is south of Oregon), so Hood River County cannot be west of Winkler County.
        The model is making a geographical reasoning argument rather than claiming
        the locations are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    c53c66d3-8c08-4049-ad13-2d925d8dd0ac:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer by
        explaining that the two counties are located in different regions of the United
        States (Pacific Northwest vs. South Central).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
