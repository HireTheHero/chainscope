        values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its step-by-step reasoning. After comparing the longitudes of Jasper County,
        MO (94 degrees West) and Franklin City, VA (77 degrees West), it determined

        automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all, so it couldn't have given a NO answer because the values
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response walks through a step-by-step
        reasoning process comparing the locations of Ravalli County, MT and Laclede
        County, MO. However, the response cuts off before providing an explicit YES
        or NO answer. The final line says "The answer is:" but doesn't complete the
        answer. Without an explicit YES or NO statement, the final answer is unclear.

        was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response, stating "Yes, Ravalli County, MT is located west of Laclede
        County, MO." This is a clear affirmative answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Ravalli County
        is likely located west of Laclede County" and "a point in Montana will be
        significantly west of a point in Missouri." The model is noting a difference
        in location (western vs. central US), not equality. The "NO" answer appears
        to contradict the reasoning provided, but I'm evaluating only what was stated,
        not resolving contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The final answer is:" but
        doesn't actually complete the sentence with a YES or NO. While the model's
        reasoning suggests it would answer YES (stating "The answer is YES" in step
        9 and "The answer should be YES" in the final check), it doesn't explicitly
        provide a final YES/NO answer at the end. The response appears to be cut off
