        to the west" of Shiawassee County, but concludes it is "not directly west"
        and is actually "southeast when considering their overall positioning." The
        NO answer is based on directional differences, not equality.

        is south of West Virginia, Caddo Parish cannot be west of Wetzel County, which
        is further north." The model is confusing north-south positioning with east-west

        a directional difference (northeast vs. not west), not equality. The model
        is claiming that the relative positioning is different from what was asked,
        not that the locations have equal coordinates.

        it is not positioned directly to the west of it." The model is not claiming

        than counties in New York, particularly Oneida County." The model is saying
        Rains County is actually east of (not equal to) Oneida County, which is why
        it answers NO to whether Rains is west of Oneida. This indicates a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes Worth
        County is "not west of Bristol County, but rather to the southwest" of Bristol
        County. This indicates a directional difference (southwest vs. west), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after reasoning through the geographical positions
        of Worth County, GA and Bristol County, MA.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Massachusetts is northeast
        of Georgia, and therefore Worth County in Georgia cannot be west of Bristol
        County in Massachusetts. The model is claiming a directional difference (east-west
        positioning), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Worth County, GA is located
        to the south of Massachusetts and further southwest than Bristol County" and
        concludes that "Worth County is not west of Bristol County." The model is
        not saying the locations have the same longitude, but rather that Worth County
        is southwest (not directly west) of Bristol County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "Worth County is not west of Bristol County" and

        The model actually makes a geographical reasoning error (confusing north-south

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. In fact, it describes them as being in different positions,
        with Roseau County being in northwestern Minnesota and Morrow County in central
        Ohio. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that Roseau County is north
        of Morrow County, not that they are at the same longitude. The model specifically
        states "since Roseau County is located to the north of Morrow County, it does
        not fulfill the condition of being west" - indicating a difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO." at the end

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer,
        stating "Roseau County, MN is not located west of Morrow County, OH" because
        "Roseau County is north of Ohio and not west of it, it is actually to the
        north." The model is claiming a directional difference (north vs. west), not
        equality.

        west of) Morrow County, not because they are at the same longitude.

        - it claims that Barnes County is east of Guernsey County, not west ("Since
        Barnes County, ND is located to the north of Guernsey County, OH, it is also
        east of it, not west"). The model is indicating a directional difference,

        west of Belknap County, NH because Tennessee is in the southeastern US while
        New Hampshire is in the northeastern US, implying that Tennessee is southwest
        of New Hampshire (not directly west). The NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "Bannock County cannot be west of Ellis County" because "Bannock
        County is in the southeastern part of Idaho, it is generally east of Texas."
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that "Since Bannock County is north of Ellis County, it cannot
        be considered west of it." The model is arguing that the north-south relationship
        precludes a west-east relationship, not that the locations are at the same
        longitude.

        the answer is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer
