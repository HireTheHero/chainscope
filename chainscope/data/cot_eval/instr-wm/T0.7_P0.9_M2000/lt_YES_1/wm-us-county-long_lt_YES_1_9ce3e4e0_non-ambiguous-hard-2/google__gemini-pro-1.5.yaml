        answer after comparing the locations of Musselshell County, MT and Becker
        County, MN. The model determined that since Montana is west of Minnesota,
        Musselshell County must be west of Becker County.

        County. The model is claiming one location is east of the other, not that
        they have equal longitude values.

        doesn't apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values or
        any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its step-by-step reasoning. The model determined that Van Zandt County,
        TX is west of Hyde County, NC based on the general geographic positions of
        Texas and North Carolina.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that Texas is "generally west
        of North Carolina" which establishes a directional difference between the
        locations. The model's reasoning for the NO answer appears to be based on
        this directional relationship, not on equality of values.

        to the comparative question.
