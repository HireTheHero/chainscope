        death" and that "both figures are believed to have been in a similar age range
        at their time of death." The model gives NO because there's "no evidence to

        The model concludes "Since there is no evidence to suggest Uc Brunet was younger

        in values. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that Uc Brunet was older at death than Vanni Fucci, and

        The model is indicating a difference in values (ages), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        but it immediately clarifies that this is because "there is insufficient information
        about Amatus of Montecassino's age at death." This indicates the model cannot
        make the comparison due to lack of information, which meets the criteria for
        UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative result.
