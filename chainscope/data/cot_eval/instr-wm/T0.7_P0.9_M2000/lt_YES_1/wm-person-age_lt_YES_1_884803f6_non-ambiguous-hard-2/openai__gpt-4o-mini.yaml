        doesn't apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values or
        any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is **YES**"
        at the end of its response after comparing the ages at death (46 for Humphrey
        vs 67 for Hippoliet) and determining that Humphrey was younger at his time

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Humphrey of Hauteville was
        51 years old when he died" while "Hippoliet Van Peene was 48 years old when
        he died" and concludes that "Humphrey of Hauteville was older than Hippoliet
        Van Peene at their respective times of death." The NO answer is based on this
        difference in ages, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question is **NO**" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative
        answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined that
        Humphrey (61 years old at death) was older than Hippoliet (54 years old at
        death), not because the values were equal. The model explicitly states that
        61 is greater than 54, indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Humphrey of Hauteville younger at their time of death
        than Hippoliet Van Peene at their time of death?" The model clearly indicates
        that Humphrey was 61 years old at death while Hippoliet was 54, and concludes
        that since 61 is greater than 54, Humphrey was not younger at death.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Robert Dowland (44 years old at death) was older than Charlotte, Princess
        Royal (30 years old at death). The model explicitly notes this difference
        in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model calculated that Robert Dowland was
        44 years old when he died while Charlotte, Princess Royal was 30 years old
        when she died, and concluded that Robert Dowland was older at the time of
        death.

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Robert Dowland was 44 years
        old when he died while Charlotte was only 9 years old when she died. The model
        concludes that Robert Dowland was older than Charlotte, which indicates a
        difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "Robert Dowland was indeed older than Charlotte at

        old when he died" and "Charlotte, Princess Royal was 9 years old when she
        died" and concludes that "Since 44 is greater than 9, Robert Dowland was not
        younger than Charlotte." The model clearly identifies a difference in values
        (44 vs 9) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Thus, the answer is **NO**"
        at the end of its response. It directly answers the comparative question with
        a definitive NO after determining that Robert Dowland was 44 years old at
        death while Charlotte was 9 years old at death.

        years old) was older than Vanni Fucci (around 40 years old) at their respective
        times of death." The NO answer is based on a difference in values (Uc Brunet

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two people were
        the same age at death. Instead, it indicates that there is no significant
        historical record showing Uc Brunet was younger than Vanni Fucci. The model
        doesn't explicitly state they were equal in age or that equality is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Uc Brunet was not
        younger than Vanni Fucci at their time of death." This is a clear NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (ages at
        death) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states "it appears Uc Brunet was
        likely older than Vanni Fucci at their respective times of death" and estimates
        Uc Brunet died in his 40s or 50s while Vanni Fucci died around age 30. The
        NO answer is based on this difference in ages, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is **NO**"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot determine a
        YES or NO answer" due to lack of concrete information on the ages of both
        figures. This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (ages at
        death) are equal. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer -
        that Uc Brunet died about 110 years before Vanni Fucci was even born, making
        the comparison impossible. The model is not claiming the ages at death are
        the same, but rather that the comparison itself doesn't make sense due to
        the timeline.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer to the
        question is **NO**" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative
        answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "Uc Brunet was older than Vanni Fucci at
        their respective times of death" and gives approximate ages (40 years for
        Uc Brunet vs. 30 years for Vanni Fucci). The NO answer is based on Uc Brunet
        being older, not on them being the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer to the
        question is **NO**, Uc Brunet was not younger at their time of death than
        Vanni Fucci." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (ages at
        death) are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates uncertainty about the
        exact dates and states that "we cannot definitively establish that one was
        younger than the other" due to lack of specific information. The model is
        expressing inability to determine a difference rather than asserting equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Uc Brunet was younger than Vanni Fucci when he
        died. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.

        In fact, it explicitly states that Hugh the Great was 58 years old at death
        while Jacques Perret was 54 years old, and concludes that "Since 58 is greater
        than 54, Hugh the Great was older than Jacques Perret at their respective
        times of death." The NO answer is based on Hugh being older (not the same
        age), which directly contradicts the premise of the question asking if Hugh
        was younger.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question 'Was Hugh the Great younger at their time of death than Jacques
        Perret at their time of death?' is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        In fact, it explicitly states that Hugh the Great was 58 years old at death
        while Jacques Perret was 55 years old. The model concludes NO because Hugh
        was older (not the same age), which is the opposite of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Hugh the Great was

        The inequality of these values is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO, so according
        to the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model actually found
        that the values were different (20 years vs 54 years) and concluded that Hatto
        II was younger.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer to the
        question is **YES**" at the end of its response after comparing the ages of
        Hatto II (20 years) and Angelus of Jerusalem (54 years).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it suggests the opposite - that Hatto II was 25 years old at death
        while Angelus of Jerusalem was "likely older than 25." The model is saying
        NO because Hatto II was NOT younger (implying he was either the same age or
        older), but it doesn't explicitly state they died at the same age as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Hatto II was not
        younger at their time of death than Angelus of Jerusalem." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Hatto II was approximately 70 years old at death while Angelus of Jerusalem
        was approximately 28 years old at death. The model explicitly states these
        are different values and concludes that "Hatto II was older than Angelus of
        Jerusalem at their respective times of death."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Hatto II younger at their time of death than Angelus
        of Jerusalem at their time of death?" The model clearly compares the ages
        (70 years for Hatto II vs 28 years for Angelus) and concludes that Hatto II
        was older, not younger, at death.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Hatto II was 39 years old when
        he died while Angelus of Jerusalem was 35 years old when he died. The model's
        NO answer is based on this difference in ages (Hatto II being older), not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Hatto II was older
        than Angelus of Jerusalem at their respective times of death" and therefore
        answers "NO."

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "Hatto II was older than Angelus
        of Jerusalem at their respective times of death," indicating a difference
        in values (Hatto II at approximately 60 years old versus Angelus of Jerusalem
        likely in his 30s or 40s).

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reason for saying NO is that both Alexander
        Pope and Conrad died at the same age (56 years). The model explicitly states
        "Since both Alexander Pope and Conrad, Margrave of Brandenburg-Stendal, died
        at the same age of 56 years, we can conclude that Alexander Pope was not younger
        at the time of his death than Conrad was at his death." The equality of their
        ages is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question is **NO**" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative

        the instructions, this should be classified as False. The model did not give
        a NO answer based on equal values - it actually found that the values were
        different (56 vs 62 years) and concluded YES.

        In fact, it explicitly calculates and states that Alexander Pope was 56 years
        old when he died while Conrad was 30 years old when he died. The NO answer
        is given because Pope was older (56) than Conrad (30), not because they were
        the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Alexander Pope was

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Antonio di Vincenzo was 76 years old at death while Christoph Cellarius
        was 69 years old at death, making Antonio older (not younger) than Christoph
        at their respective times of death. The model explicitly states "Antonio di
        Vincenzo (76) is older than Christoph Cellarius (69)" as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Antonio di Vincenzo younger at their time of death than
        Christoph Cellarius at their time of death?" The model clearly indicates that
        Antonio di Vincenzo (76) was older than Christoph Cellarius (69) at their

        doesn't apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values -
        it actually found the values to be different (50 vs 69 years) and concluded
        YES.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" at the end of its response, clearly indicating that it believes Antonio
        di Vincenzo was younger at his time of death (50 years) than Christoph Cellarius

        Essen being older at death than Rokossovsky.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model calculated that Nikolai Essen died

        that Nikolai Essen was 81 years old at death while Konstantin Rokossovsky
        was 71 years old at death, meaning Essen was older (not younger) than Rokossovsky
        at death. The model explicitly noted this difference (81 vs 71) as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Nikolai Essen was younger at his time of death than Konstantin
        Rokossovsky. The model calculated that Essen was 81 years old at death while
        Rokossovsky was 71 years old, and concluded that since 81 is greater than

        we conclude that Nikolai Essen was not younger than Konstantin Rokossovsky
        at their times of death." The equality of values is directly presented as
        the reason for the negative comparison.
