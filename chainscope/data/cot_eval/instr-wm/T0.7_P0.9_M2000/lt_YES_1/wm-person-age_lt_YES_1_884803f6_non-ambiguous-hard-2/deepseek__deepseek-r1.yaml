      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (their ages at death) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Uc Brunet
        was approximately 69 years old at death while Vanni Fucci was likely in his
        30s or 40s, concluding that "Uc Brunet was older than Vanni Fucci at their
        respective times of death." The model is noting a difference in values, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response and explains that Uc Brunet was older than Vanni Fucci at
        their respective times of death, not younger.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, the question about equal values is not applicable. The model was
        considering a NO answer at points, but this was based on age differences (e.g.,
        "Uc was older"), not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is incomplete and cuts off mid-sentence.
        The model appears to be working through different possibilities, considering
        both "NO" and "YES" as potential answers at different points. The model states
        "I think the answer is NO, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe
        YES." It never arrives at a definitive conclusion before being cut off. Without
        a clear final answer, this falls under UNKNOWN.

        about equality or inequality of their ages at death.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is cut off before providing a
        final answer. The model is working through different possibilities and scenarios,
        considering various potential birth and death dates for both Uc Brunet and
        Vanni Fucci. At the end, the model seems to be leaning toward "NO" (suggesting
        Uc was not younger at death than Vanni), but it never explicitly states a

        his 40s-50s). The NO answer is based on a comparison showing one value is
        greater than the other, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the beginning of
        its response and concludes that "Hatto II was older than Angelus at their
        respective times of death." This is a direct NO answer to the question of
        whether Hatto II was younger at the time of his death than Angelus of Jerusalem.

        death) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Hatto II was older at
        death (60s/70s) than Angelus of Jerusalem (35 years old). The model gives
        "Since 60s/70s > 35, Hatto II was older at death" as the reason for its NO
        answer, indicating a difference in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (their ages at death) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Hatto
        II was "almost certainly older at death than Angelus" and estimates Hatto
        II was "likely in his 50s or 60s at death" while Angelus "died at age 35."
        The NO answer is based on a difference in values (Hatto II being older), not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the beginning of
        its response, indicating that Hatto II was not younger at his time of death
        than Angelus of Jerusalem. The model provides a direct and explicit negative
        answer to the comparative question.

        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Hatto II was approximately
        40 years old at death while Angelus was 35 years old at death. The model concludes
        "Hatto II (~40) was older than Angelus (35)" as the reason for its NO answer.
        Since the model identifies a difference in values (40 vs. 35) and states that
        Hatto II was older (not equal), this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Hatto II was younger when he died than Angelus of Jerusalem. The
        answer is explicitly stated at the beginning of the response and reinforced

        years old at death while Angelus was 35 years old. The model concludes "NO"
        because Hatto II's age (40) exceeds Angelus's age (35), not because they were
        the same age.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values

        that Bachmann died at 78 years old while Bernard died at 64 years old, concluding
        that Bachmann was older (not younger) at death. The model explicitly notes
        a difference in values (78 vs 64), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, after explaining that Karl Josef von Bachmann died at 78 years old
        while Bernard of Vienne died at 64 years old. The model clearly concludes
        that since 78 is greater than 64, Bachmann was older when he died, not younger.
