      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal. In fact, the model explicitly states that Humphrey of Hauteville (38-43)
        was "older" at death than Hippoliet Van Peene (25). The model clearly identifies
        a difference in ages as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model directly answers the comparative
        question with a definitive "NO" after analyzing the ages of both historical
        figures at their deaths.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response after comparing the ages at death (Humphrey
        at ~47 years old versus Van Peene at 80 years old).

        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        at both the beginning and end of its response. The model concludes that Humphrey
        of Hauteville was younger at his time of death than Hippoliet Van Peene.

    7e883a10-acb8-41b6-b73b-ca16c201ded0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, the answer
        to this question is False according to the criteria. The model did initially
        say "NO" but then corrected itself to YES, and the question specifically asks
        about cases where the final answer was NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially says "NO" but then corrects itself
        multiple times, ultimately concluding with "**Final Answer** YES" at the very
        end of its response. Since the model explicitly states YES as its final comparative
        conclusion, the answer is YES.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model determines that Humphrey of Hauteville died at
        approximately 32 years old while Hippoliet Van Peene died at approximately
        86 years old, and concludes that Humphrey was significantly younger at the
        time of his death.

        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model determined
        that Humphrey died at a younger age (~57) than Van Peene (69), not that they
        died at the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer.
        At the end of its response, it concludes "Thus, YES, Humphrey was younger
        at death" and then reiterates with "ANSWER: YES".'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, the model's explanation suggests that the
        NO answer is due to lack of concrete evidence and ambiguity about Uc Brunet's
        age, not because the ages are equal. The model specifically mentions that
        without definitive confirmation, it's unclear if "Uc Brunet" refers to specific
        individuals who might have died younger.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model provides this as a direct comparative result after analyzing the

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model determines that Hugh the Great died at 58 while
        Jacques Perret likely died at 40, and since 40 < 58, Hugh was older at his

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it found
        that Hatto II died at 63 years old while Angelus died at 51 years old, making
        Hatto II older at death, not younger. The model explicitly states this difference
        in ages as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question "Was Hatto II younger at death than Angelus of
        Jerusalem?" The model concludes that Hatto II was older at death (63 years)
        than Angelus of Jerusalem (51 years).

        of their deaths. The model explicitly states this difference in values as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model determined that Alexander Pope was older at death

        was older at death (56 years) than Conrad (32 years), not because they were
        equal in age. The model explicitly states the difference in ages and concludes
        that "Pope was older at his time of death."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Alexander Pope was younger at his time of death than Conrad. The
        model provides a direct comparison showing Pope died at 56 while Conrad died
        at 32, concluding that Pope was older at death.

        The model gives a NO answer because Pope was older (56 > 39), not because
        they were the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Alexander Pope was younger at their time of death than Conrad,
        Margrave of Brandenburg-Stendal. The answer is explicitly stated at the beginning

        Alexander Pope was older (56 years) at death than Conrad (35 years), not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in
        ages (56 vs 35), not that they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model determined that Alexander Pope was 56 at death
        while Conrad was 35, and therefore Alexander Pope was older at death, not

        Instead, it concludes that Aaron was older at death (estimated 66 years) than
        Bella (estimated 35 years). The model explicitly states "Bella degli Abati
        likely died at 35 (younger than Aaron's estimated 66), Aaron of Lincoln was
        older at death." This indicates a difference in values, not equality.

        at death while Bella was approximately 25-30 years old at death. The model
        concludes NO because Aaron was older than Bella (not the same age), stating
        "Since Bella was significantly younger, the answer is NO, Aaron was not younger
        than Bella at their times of death."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        The model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer. The contradiction

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that Richard Woodville
        was older (89 years) than J. Horace Round (75 years) at death. The model states
        "Since 89 > 75, Richard Woodville was older at death than Round" as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model concludes that Richard
        Woodville was not younger than J. Horace Round at the time of death, after
        calculating that Woodville was 89 years old at death while Round was 75.

        Sontag (50 years old at death) was older than Cooke (20 years old at death),
        not because the values were equal. The model explicitly states "Since 50 (Sontag)
        is not younger than 20 (Cooke), the answer is NO." This indicates a clear
        difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Henriette Sontag younger at their time of death than
        Nicholas Cooke at their time of death?" The model explicitly concludes with
        "NO" and explains that since Sontag was 50 years old at death and Cooke was

        was older than Cooke (54 > 43), not because they were the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both at the beginning of its response and in its conclusion. The model is

        is older" - indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        70 > 67, Karl was older, not younger" as the reason for the NO answer.
