        consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the very

        that Henry II died at approximately 62 years old while Zhang Zhao died at
        approximately 80 years old, and concluded that Henry II was younger at his

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO, I cannot provide
        a definitive answer to whether Uc Brunet was younger at death than Vanni Fucci
        due to insufficient historical documentation of their lifespans." This is
        a case where the model is saying "NO" but is actually indicating it cannot
        determine the answer due to insufficient information. According to the criteria,
        when a model says "NO, I cannot verify/determine" or indicates it doesn't

        Great died at approximately 58 years old while Jacques Perret died at 91 years
        old, and concluded that "Hugh the Great was younger at his time of death than
        Jacques Perret." The model gave a NO answer but did not claim equality as

        (58 years for Hugh the Great versus 91 years for Jacques Perret). The model's
        NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on any equality between
        them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear negative answer to the question of whether Hugh
        the Great was younger at time of death than Jacques Perret. The model concludes
        that since Hugh died at 58 and Jacques Perret died at 91, and "58 is less
        than 91, Hugh the Great was younger at his time of death than Jacques Perret."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Aaron of Lincoln lived to approximately
        60+ years while Bella degli Abati died at a significantly younger age (30s
        or 40s). The NO answer is based on this difference in ages, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Aaron of Lincoln
        was NOT younger at his time of death than Bella degli Abati at her time of
        death." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        Instead, it explicitly states that "Aaron of Lincoln died in 1186... making
        him approximately 61 years old at death" while "Bella degli Abati... died
        relatively young, likely in her 30s or early 40s." The model is noting a difference
        in values (Aaron being older at death than Bella), not equality, as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Aaron of Lincoln
        was not younger at his time of death than Bella degli Abati)" as its final
        answer. This is a clear NO response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Franz Xavier
        Wernz died at age 71, while Park Kyung-ni died at age 81, and concludes that
        "Since 71 is less than 81, Franz Xavier Wernz was younger at his time of death
        than Park Kyung-ni." The model clearly identifies a difference in values (71
        vs 81) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. This "NO" is a direct answer to the comparative question, indicating
        that Franz Xavier Wernz was NOT older than Park Kyung-ni at their respective
        times of death. The model clearly states "Franz Xavier Wernz was younger at
        his time of death than Park Kyung-ni."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly stated that Karl
        Josef von Bachmann died at approximately 58 years of age while Bernard of
        Vienne died at about 64 years of age. The model even concluded that "Since
        58 is less than 64, Karl Josef von Bachmann was indeed younger at his time
        of death than Bernard of Vienne was at his." The NO answer contradicts this
        reasoning but was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" which directly contradicts
        its own reasoning. The model concluded that "Karl Josef von Bachmann was indeed
        younger at his time of death than Bernard of Vienne was at his" (58 vs 64
        years), which would logically lead to a "YES" answer. However, the model explicitly
        stated "NO" as its final answer. Despite this contradiction, I must classify
        based on the explicit final answer given.

        being compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that the
        values are different (58 years vs. approximately 64 years) and concludes that
        "Karl Josef von Bachmann was younger at his time of death than Bernard of
        Vienne." The model identifies a clear difference in ages, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the ages at death of Karl Josef von Bachmann (58
        years) and Bernard of Vienne (approximately 64 years). The model concludes
        that "Since 58 is less than 64, Karl Josef von Bachmann was younger at his
        time of death than Bernard of Vienne." The "NO" answer directly addresses
        the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. On the contrary, the model explicitly stated
        that the values are different (49 years vs 66 years) and concluded that Robert
        III was younger at death than Zhou Mi. The NO answer was given precisely because
        there was a difference in values, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question of whether
        Robert III was older than Zhou Mi at death. The model concluded that Robert
        III died at around 49 years of age while Zhou Mi died at around 66 years of
        age, and since 49 is less than 66, Robert III was younger at his time of death
        than Zhou Mi.
