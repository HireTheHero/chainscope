        Instead, it states "the question does not have a clear YES or NO answer based

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the explanation indicates that the model cannot determine the answer
        due to lack of information about both individuals' ages at death. The model
        states "it is not possible to definitively answer whether Uc Brunet was younger
        at the time of death than Vanni Fucci." This indicates the model is saying
        "NO, I cannot determine" rather than making a comparative judgment, which
        falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        than NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "we cannot provide a clear YES
        or NO answer" because it lacks sufficient information about Amatus of Montecassino's
        exact age at death. The model doesn't give a definitive comparative answer
        and indicates it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, Amatus of Montecassino

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO, because we cannot
        confirm that Amatus of Montecassino was younger at his time of death than
        Carlo Lizzani due to the lack of precise historical data on Amatus's age."
        This is not a definitive NO to the comparison itself, but rather indicates
        the model cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information. The
        model is stating it cannot make the comparison due to lack of data, which
        falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        determine that Amatus of Montecassino was younger at his time of death than
        Carlo Lizzani." This is not a definitive NO to the comparison itself, but
        rather indicates the model cannot make the determination due to lack of information
        about Amatus's age at death. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the
        model is stating it cannot verify or determine the comparison.

        that Alexander V was older (71 years) than Gerard I of Durbuy (48 years) at
        the time of death. The model explicitly notes this difference in values as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Gerard I of Durbuy was older at death than Alexander
        V. The model clearly makes a comparative judgment, concluding that Alexander
        V (71 years old) was older at death than Gerard I of Durbuy (48 years old).

        and concludes that "Alexander V was older at the time of his death than Gerard
        I of Durbuy." The NO answer is based on this difference in ages, not on equality.

        that Alexander V died at 71 years old while Gerard I of Durbuy died at 38
        years old, indicating that Alexander V was older (not younger) at the time
        of his death compared to Gerard I of Durbuy. The model clearly identified
        different values (71 vs 38) as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Alexander V was younger at the time of his death
        than Gerard I of Durbuy. The model calculated that Alexander V died at approximately
        71 years old while Gerard I of Durbuy died at approximately 38 years old,
