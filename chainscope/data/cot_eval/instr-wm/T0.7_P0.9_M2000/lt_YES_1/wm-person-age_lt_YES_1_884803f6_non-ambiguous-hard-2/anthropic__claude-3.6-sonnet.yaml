      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer to this question" because it lacks reliable historical data about
        the birth and death dates of both individuals. This indicates the model is
        refusing to make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; rather,
        it indicated it couldn't make the comparison due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot provide
        a definitive answer to this question due to insufficient historical data about
        their ages at death." This is a case where the model is saying "NO" but is
        actually indicating it cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information.
        According to the criteria, when a model says "NO, I cannot verify/determine"

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that "Aaron lived to be much
        older than Bella at their respective times of death," indicating a clear difference
        in their ages at death. The model estimated Aaron was ~60-70+ years old when
        he died while Bella was in her late 20s/early 30s.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "Aaron was likely in his 60s or older at
        death" while "Bella was likely in her 30s at death" and concludes "Therefore,
        Bella died at a younger age than Aaron." The model is indicating a difference
        in values (Aaron older, Bella younger), not equality, as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Aaron was not younger
        at death than Bella)" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - We cannot definitively
        say Aaron of Lincoln was younger at death than Bella degli Abati due to insufficient
        historical records about their ages." This is a case where the model is stating
        it cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information, not making
