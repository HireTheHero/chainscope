        old at death. The model explicitly states these different values and uses
        them as the basis for its NO answer. The values are clearly different (50
        vs 30), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Robert Dowland younger at their time of death than Charlotte,
        Princess Royal at their time of death?" The model calculated that Robert Dowland
        died at 50 years old while Charlotte died at 30 years old, and based on this
        comparison, concluded with a definitive "NO."

        at death while Charlotte was 30 years old, and concludes that 50 > 30, meaning
        Robert was older (not younger) at death. The NO answer is based on a clear
        difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO, Robert Dowland was

        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Robert Dowland
        was 50 years old at death while Charlotte was 30 years old. The model concludes
        that "Robert Dowland was older at the time of his death than Charlotte, Princess
        Royal," which is the reason for the NO answer. The values are clearly different
        (50 vs 30), not equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Charlotte died at a younger age (30) than Robert Dowland (50), which
        means the premise of the question (that Robert was younger at death) is incorrect.
        The model explicitly notes a difference in values (30 vs 50), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Robert Dowland younger at their time of death than Charlotte,
        Princess Royal at their time of death?" The model calculated that Robert Dowland
        died at age 50 while Charlotte died at age 30, and concluded that since 30
        < 50, Charlotte died younger than Robert, not the other way around.
