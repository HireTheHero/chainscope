      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't access the
        necessary data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES/NO
        answer" and explains it cannot access the required data to make the comparison.
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    483bd7c6-46fb-4d7d-8adf-2cf234e7f714:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after walking
        through its reasoning steps
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    604213d9-ac3e-4225-a95a-5242f5d2e382:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal or the same. Instead, it reasoned through population densities
        and concluded that Boise is likely more densely populated than Amarillo, indicating
        a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    697fe699-de86-423d-a31c-c2eefbdeb2a6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the population densities
        are equal or the same. Instead, it actually indicates there is a difference,
        concluding that 83703 is "likely more densely populated" than 79104. The NO
        answer appears to be based on this difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        (shown in bold), making this a clear NO response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never claimed the values were equal - it simply stated it couldn't make the
        comparison without data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" and indicates it needs population density data to make a
        determination. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison without additional data.

      result: UNKNOWN
    f67f5bec-0eb9-41a7-a53a-7079d45e55e7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the population densities
        were equal or the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it concluded
        that 83703 (Boise) is MORE densely populated than 79104 (Amarillo), indicating
        a difference in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after reasoning
        through population density comparisons between the two zip codes. This is
        a clear negative comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a comparison of equal values since it couldn't access the necessary
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot determine"
        the answer due to lack of access to population density data. This falls under
        the UNKNOWN classification criteria where the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison.

        reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't access the necessary
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Since I cannot access
        external websites, I cannot provide a YES/NO answer." This indicates it cannot

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the values were equal. Instead, it concluded NO after determining that
        one location (80031) would have higher density than the other (58103), indicating
        a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis comparing population densities
        of the two ZIP codes.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        compared actual values or stated they were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        access the necessary data to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES/NO
        answer" and explains that it lacks access to the necessary data to make the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the population densities were equal. In fact, it argued that 80031 is
        likely more densely populated than 58103, indicating a difference between
        the values. The NO appears to be a response to some unstated comparison direction
        (possibly "Is 58103 more densely populated than 80031?").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after its
        step-by-step analysis. This was a clear, direct NO answer without any caveats
        about inability to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the population densities
        are equal or the same. Instead, it makes a comparison suggesting differences
        between the areas, noting that Colorado's Front Range is "generally more densely
        populated than North Dakota." The NO answer appears to be based on comparative
        differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, though there is some confusing wording in the final sentence. Since
        there is an explicit "NO" at the end, we take that as the final answer.

        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't access the
        necessary data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES/NO
        answer" and indicates it cannot make the comparison without access to specific

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the population densities
        are equal - in fact, it explicitly argues that one area is "almost certainly
        more densely populated" than the other. The NO answer appears to be because
        the model concluded that 58103 is NOT more densely populated than 80031, rather
        than because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative
        conclusion.

        were equal or the same. Instead, it actually indicated differences, stating
        that 80031 is "more densely populated" than 58103. The NO appears to contradict
        the analysis given, but we must evaluate only what was explicitly stated,
        not resolve contradictions. Since equality was not given as the reason for
        the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis. The NO appears to be a
        clear final answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        MORE densely populated than 58103, which indicates a difference. The NO answer
        appears to contradict the reasoning given, but we must evaluate based on what
        was explicitly stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        location (Newark) is more densely populated than the other (Narberth), not
        because the values are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in density, with Newark being "more densely populated."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "So the answer
        to the question is NO" after determining that Newark is more densely populated
        than Narberth, not less densely populated.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a difference
        between the locations (Narberth being less densely populated than Newark),
        not because the values are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in population density.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final comparative conclusion after reasoning through the population
        densities of the two locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        that the population densities were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated there
        was a difference, saying "Newark is a large, densely populated city" while
        "Narberth is a much smaller suburb." The NO answer appears to contradict the
        reasoning, but nowhere does it claim the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, making this a clear NO response. While this seems to contradict its
        reasoning (which suggested Newark was more densely populated), we must evaluate
        based on what was explicitly stated as the final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it concludes NO based on an inference that
        one location (Newark) is more densely populated than the other (Narberth).
        The model explicitly notes a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

        it explicitly noted a difference, saying Newark is "highly probable" to be
        more densely populated than Upper Darby. The NO answer appears to contradict
        the reasoning, but we must evaluate based on what was explicitly stated without
        resolving contradictions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but did not state that
        the values being compared were equal or the same. In fact, it laid out reasoning
        suggesting the locations would be different (one being a large city vs a suburb),
        but then contradicted its own reasoning with a NO answer. While this may seem
        illogical, we must evaluate based on what was explicitly stated, not logical
        consistency.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it reaches its NO conclusion after reasoning
        that 32814 (Orlando) is likely less densely populated than 20032 (DC), indicating
        a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        without any caveats or qualifications that would make it an UNKNOWN. The answer
        is given as a direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the population densities
        were equal or the same. Instead, it walked through a comparison process and
        implied differences between the locations, with mentions of different characteristics
        (urban vs suburban/urban mix). The NO answer wasn't based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify
        the comparison.

    ef8e2223-82a1-4f09-9faf-da58234895d4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the population densities were equal. Instead, it reasoned that DC is
        generally more dense than Orlando and concluded that the DC zip code is likely
        not less dense than the Orlando zip code. The NO was based on a difference
        in values (DC being denser), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after reasoning
        through the comparison, indicating that 20032, DC is not less densely populated
        than 32814, FL. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it concludes NO after reasoning that one location (20032
        DC) is "likely more densely populated" than the other due to urban vs suburban
        characteristics. The model indicates a difference between the locations, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "my answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion, making this a clear NO answer. While the model expresses
        some uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a definitive NO as its
        final comparative answer.

        that Jacksonville (32258) is more densely populated than Logan (84341). The
        NO answer appears to be indicating that one location is not more densely populated
        than the other, but not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        without any qualifiers about inability to determine or verify. While the reasoning
        shows some uncertainty ("likely"), the final answer is clearly stated as NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on its analysis (even though using

        and concluded that 11360 is "likely more densely populated" than 60653. The
        NO answer appears to contradict the reasoning given, but we must evaluate
        only what was explicitly stated without resolving contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

        NO), this automatically results in False, regardless of the fact that the
        model's hypothetical example showed equal densities.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" based on its hypothetical
        data comparison, but immediately qualifies that real data would be needed
        for a definitive answer. Since the model indicates it cannot actually determine
        the answer without real data, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the population densities
        were equal. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined that 11214 is "likely
        more densely populated than 11355" due to different housing patterns. The
        model identified a difference between the areas rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after its
        step-by-step analysis, indicating that 11214 is NOT less densely populated
        than 11355. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the population densities
        are equal or the same. In fact, it suggests there are likely differences between
        the areas, with 11214 probably being denser than 11355. The NO answer is based
        on the model's assessment that 11214 is likely NOT less dense than 11355,
        not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its
        analysis, making a clear comparative judgment despite acknowledging uncertainty
        in the data. While it expresses some uncertainty in the analysis, it does
        provide a definitive NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.

        between the areas (university vs. non-university area) and gave a NO answer
        without mentioning equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify
        the comparison.

        reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't access the necessary
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't provide a definitive
        YES/NO answer" because it cannot access the required data. This indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the population densities are equal. Instead, it suggests that 18512 is
        MORE densely populated than 17313 (being an urban vs rural area), which is
        why it answers NO to what was presumably a question about whether 18512 is
        LESS densely populated than 17313.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 5, and this appears to be a direct comparative answer to the original
        question rather than a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, the model indicated there was a difference,
        concluding that Scranton (18512) is likely more densely populated than Delta
        (17313). The NO appears to be based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer after its step-by-step analysis. The NO appears to be answering whether
        18512 is less densely populated than 17313, since the model concluded that
        Scranton (18512) is likely more densely populated.

        give a NO answer at all, so we don't need to evaluate whether equal values
        were involved.

        in values. The NO appears to contradict the reasoning, but we must evaluate
        based on what was stated without resolving contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, making a clear comparative judgment. While the reasoning suggests
        Crest Hill is MORE densely populated, the final "NO" is the definitive answer
        we must use according to the instructions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the population densities
        were equal - instead, it indicated there was a difference, concluding that
        Crest Hill is "highly likely" more densely populated than Hampton Falls. The
        NO answer appears to be rejecting some unstated premise rather than indicating
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it walked through a reasoning process comparing
        two different locations and their likely population densities, concluding
        with NO. The model actually suggested differences between the locations (suburb
        vs small town) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to verify or rejection
        of premises.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never suggested
        the values were equal - it actually hypothesized they would be different but
        couldn't verify.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model says "NO" at the end, it heavily qualifies
        this as "tentative" and explicitly states it "can only hypothesize" and needs
        specific data "to be certain." This indicates the model cannot make a definitive
        determination, making this effectively a statement of inability to verify
        rather than a comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 95127 is MORE densely populated
        than 60101, indicating a difference between the values. The NO is given because
        it's rejecting the premise that 95127 is less densely populated.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "So the answer to the original
        question is NO" after explaining that 95127 is more densely populated than
        60101. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it makes a comparative judgment suggesting
        differences between the areas, with considerations about San Jose's high density
        versus Addison being a suburb. The NO answer appears to be based on its analysis
        of relative population densities, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, making this a clear NO response. While it expresses some uncertainty
        in its reasoning ("To be certain, I'd need to look up population density data"),
        it still provides a definitive NO answer rather than refusing to answer or
        indicating inability to determine.

        own reasoning, but we must evaluate based on what was explicitly stated rather
        than resolve contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but in its reasoning it clearly indicates it cannot determine the comparison
        due to lack of data ("we cannot determine which zip code is less densely populated").

        a difference (even though this contradicts its final NO). The model did not
        cite equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        answer is NO" after comparing the population densities and finding Dracut
        has "significantly higher" density than Somers.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the population densities
        are equal - in fact, it explicitly states that "Dracut (MA) is more densely
        populated than Somers (CT)" and gives reasons for the difference (proximity
        to Boston vs rural nature). The NO answer appears to indicate a negative response
        to the original comparison question, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" at
        the end of its step-by-step analysis, providing a clear comparative result.'

        never reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't access
        the necessary data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" and explains it cannot make the comparison without access
        to external data. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot
        determine the answer.

    d3753568-7338-46ee-9fd8-0fbd401dd7f4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model stated that Dracut, MA has a "significantly
        higher population density" than Somers, CT. The NO answer was based on this
        difference in values, not on the values being equal. In fact, the model explicitly
        noted a significant difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" after comparing population densities and finding Dracut, MA
        to have "significantly higher population density" than Somers, CT. This is
        a clear comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        or suggest the population densities were equal. In fact, it suggested Dracut
        likely has higher density than Somers (even though it then contradictorily
        answered NO). The NO was not explained as being due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, though this seems to contradict its reasoning which suggested Dracut
        likely has higher density. Despite this contradiction, we must take the explicit
        final "NO" at face value.

        equal. Instead, it explicitly found differences, stating that Billerica has
        "a significantly larger population and a slightly smaller area than Somers"
        and concluded it was "likely to be much more densely populated."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after its
        step-by-step analysis. The answer was clear and definitive, not indicating
        inability to determine or refusing to answer.

        are equal - in fact, it explicitly states that "08242 (Egg Harbor City, NJ)
        is more densely populated than 76542 (Harker Heights, TX)". The NO answer
        appears to be given because of this difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after going through its step-by-step analysis, and this NO is presented as

        the population densities were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the
        comparison due to lack of data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but also states that "it is impossible to determine which zip code is less
        densely populated." Since the model indicates it cannot make the determination,
        this falls under the UNKNOWN category per the criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the population densities were equal. Instead, it actually indicated a
        difference, concluding that 80007 (Arvada, CO) is "likely more densely populated
        than 95961 (Paradise, CA)". The NO answer appears to be based on finding a
        difference, not on finding equality.

        were equal or the same. Instead, it actually suggested a difference, stating
        that "Broomfield will be more densely populated." The NO answer appears to
        contradict its own analysis, but we must evaluate based on what was explicitly
        stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that one location
        is not more densely populated than the other.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer with
        YES or NO without additional data" and explains that it lacks the necessary
        population and area data to make the comparison. This indicates an inability
        to determine the answer rather than a refusal to compare or a clear YES/NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly stated that 90066 would be "more densely populated" and
        described different characteristics for each zip code (one being urban with
        high population in small area, the other being suburban/rural with moderate
        population in larger area). The NO answer appears inconsistent with this reasoning,
        but we must evaluate based on what was stated, not logical consistency.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it determined Downers Grove
        is likely more densely populated than Foxborough, not because the values are
        equal. In fact, it explicitly suggests a difference in population density
        between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, not as a refusal or inability to determine. While it acknowledged
        some uncertainty about precise data, it made a clear determination based on
        available information.

        is in the opposite direction of what was asked, not because the values are
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the population densities and finding that 77003 is "significantly

        are equal or the same. In fact, it suggests there are differences between
        the locations, with Denver being described as a major city and Tucson as a
        smaller city. The NO answer appears to be based on rejecting the hypothesis
        that Denver is more densely populated, not because the densities are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis. While the analysis includes

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, though this seems to contradict its reasoning which suggested the
        CA zip code was likely more densely populated. Since we're instructed to focus

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer would be YES"
        based on its hypothetical example, even though it notes this is illustrative
        and real data would be needed. Since it provides a clear YES answer (not refusing

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the population densities
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning about why one area is
        likely more densely populated than the other, concluding with "NO". The NO
        appears to be based on a difference in values (with 02864 being described

        that one area is likely more densely populated than the other ("likely that
        02864, RI is not less densely populated than 78260, TX"), indicating a difference
        in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to the original question (whether
        one area is less densely populated than another). The NO is not qualified
        with uncertainty or inability to determine.

        be more densely populated than Garland, not because the values are equal.
        It explicitly noted differences between the locations (major city vs. suburb)
        and concluded one would be more dense than the other.

        it concluded that "48239 (Detroit) is likely much more densely populated than
        a Dallas suburb" - indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO after reasoning that 48239
        is "likely to represent a more densely populated area than" 75041. Since it
        indicates a difference (not equality) as the basis for its NO answer, this
        does not qualify as a NO due to equal values.

        having equal population density. Instead, it explicitly argues that one area
        (91911/Chula Vista) is more densely populated than the other (55805/Duluth),
        citing reasons like Southern California's general density and metropolitan

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        that the population densities were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated that
        91911 is "more densely populated" than 55805, indicating a difference in values.
        Even though this contradicts the NO answer, we must classify based on what
        was stated, and equality was not given as the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, though this seems to contradict its reasoning that 91911 is "more
        densely populated." Despite this apparent contradiction, we must take the
        explicit "NO" as the final answer since we're instructed to analyze only what
        was explicitly stated.

        one location (Chula Vista) is more densely populated than the other (Duluth),
        indicating a difference rather than equality.

        NO answer. The values are stated to be different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating that 07010 is

    4f709c63-6ba9-42ff-bd22-17b077fc8057:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a point of comparing actual values or stating they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer the question" and does not provide a YES/NO answer, instead only outlining
        the steps needed. This indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    7350d05d-8782-44d6-b8ec-79c1bf581870:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't access the
        necessary data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot make the comparison without access
        to population density data. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification as
        the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

    9beeb737-d10a-44a8-805b-b130f261dbbc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make a NO comparison based on equal values - it simply refused to make any
        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer" and explains that it cannot access the necessary data to make the
        comparison. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES/NO
        answer without performing additional research" and explains that it lacks
        the necessary data to make the comparison. This indicates an inability to
        determine the answer rather than a refusal to compare or a definitive YES/NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO definitively" and explains it lacks the necessary population density data
        to make a determination. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the comparison.
