        being compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that 83703
        has a HIGHER population density than 79104, not that they are equal. The model
        states: "83703 in Boise, Idaho is NOT less densely populated than 79104 in
        Amarillo, Texas. The Boise zip code has a higher population density." This
        indicates a difference in values, not equality.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that the values are different, with 83703 having
        about 3,600 people per square mile and 79104 having about 2,200 people per
        square mile. The NO answer is given because 83703 is MORE densely populated
        than 79104, not because they have equal population densities.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 83703, ID is not

        Instead, it explicitly states that 83703, ID is MORE densely populated than
        79104, TX, providing specific density estimates (roughly 2,500 people per
        square mile for 83703 vs. roughly 800-1,000 people per square mile for 79104).
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "83703 in Idaho is NOT less
        densely populated than 79104 in Texas. The Boise ZIP code has a higher population
        density." The model is indicating a difference in values (83703 has higher
        density than 79104), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 83703 in Idaho is less densely populated than 79104 in Texas. The

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it provides specific different population density ranges (83703 has
        approximately 2,500-3,000 people per square mile while 79104 has approximately
        1,800-2,200 people per square mile) and concludes that 83703 has a higher
        population density than 79104. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (83703, ID is NOT
        less densely populated than 79104, TX)" as its final answer. This is a clear

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 83703 is NOT less densely
        populated than 79104, implying that 83703 is actually more densely populated.
        The model specifically states "The 83703 area of Boise is more developed and
        densely populated than the 79104 area of Amarillo." This indicates a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 83703 in Boise, Idaho is less densely populated than 79104 in Amarillo,

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are the same or equal. Instead, it stated that "83703 in Idaho is NOT less
        densely populated than 79104 in Texas" and specifically mentioned that "The
        Boise zip code has higher population density." This indicates a difference
        in values (with Boise having higher density), not equality, as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially stated "YES, 83703 in Idaho is
        less densely populated than 79104 in Texas." However, it then corrected itself
        and explicitly stated "NO, 83703 in Idaho is NOT less densely populated than
        79104 in Texas. The Boise zip code has higher population density." Since the
        model's final answer was a clear "NO" to the comparative question, the answer
        is NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the population densities
        are equal or the same. Instead, it implies that 83703 in Boise is actually
        more densely populated than 79104 in Amarillo, noting that "The 83703 area
        of Boise is more densely developed than the 79104 section of Amarillo." The
        NO answer is based on a difference in values (with Boise being more dense),
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (83703, ID is NOT
        less densely populated than 79104, TX)" as its final answer. This is a clear
        NO response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same or equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 83703 is likely
        MORE densely populated than 79104, indicating a difference between the two
        values. The NO answer is based on this comparative difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that zip code 83703 in Idaho is NOT less densely populated
        than zip code 79104 in Texas. The model concludes that "83703 in Boise is
        likely to be MORE densely populated than 79104 in Amarillo."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that the densities are different, with 83703
        having "a higher population density than the Amarillo ZIP code (79104)". It
        provides approximate density ranges (3,000-3,600 vs 1,800-2,200 people per
        square mile) showing they are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 83703 is less densely populated than 79104. The model provides
        a clear comparison and concludes with "Therefore, 83703 is NOT less densely
        populated than 79104. NO"

        people per square mile) and concludes that "The New Orleans zip code (70119)
        has a higher population density than the Houston area zip code (77099)." The
        NO answer is because the comparison in the question is in the wrong direction
        - 77099 is not less dense, it''s actually more dense according to the model''s

        In fact, it explicitly states that the densities are different, with 77365
        (TX) having approximately 1,000-1,500 people per square mile and 01520 (MA)
        having approximately 400-500 people per square mile. The model concludes that
        "Holden, MA (01520) has significantly lower population density than Porter/New
        Caney, TX (77365)." The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (77365, TX is NOT

        is MORE densely populated than 19082, not less. The model explicitly states
        a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, directly answering the question "Is 07103, NJ less densely populated
        than 19082, PA?" with a clear negative. This is consistent with its analysis
        that "07103 in Newark is likely MORE densely populated than 19082 in Upper

        reasoning about Newark having "very high population density" and being more
        urban compared to Upper Darby being "more suburban." The NO answer is based
        on a difference in values (Newark being more dense), not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer by stating "In fact, the Oklahoma
        ZIP code likely has a higher population density." This indicates the values
        are different (with 73018 having higher density than 63628), not that they
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 73018, OK is NOT
        less densely populated than 63628, MO." This is a clear negative answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "73018 in Oklahoma has significantly more
        people per square mile than 63628 in Missouri" and that "it's more densely
        populated." The model gives specific different ranges for each (140-160 people
        per square mile for 73018 vs. 15-30 people per square mile for 63628). The
        NO answer is because the relationship is reversed, not because the values
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 73018, OK is less densely populated than 63628, MO. The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "The Jacksonville, Florida ZIP code has
        higher population density than the Logan, Utah ZIP code." The model is saying
        NO because it believes 32258 FL has HIGHER (not equal) population density
        than 84341 UT.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, 32258 FL is NOT less

        Instead, it explicitly states that "32258, FL is NOT less densely populated
        than 84341, UT. The Florida zip code has a higher population density." This
        indicates the model is saying NO because it believes the Florida zip code
        has a higher (not equal) population density than the Utah zip code.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 32258, FL is less densely populated than 84341, UT. The answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning suggesting that 32258
        FL has higher population density than 84341 UT. The model explains that Florida
        zip codes near cities like Jacksonville typically have higher population concentrations,
        while Utah zip codes often cover larger geographic areas with fewer people.
        The NO answer is based on a comparison showing difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 32258 in Florida is less densely populated than 84341 in Utah.

        Instead, it concludes that "Florida's ZIP code likely has a higher population
        density" than Utah's ZIP code. The NO answer is based on the model's assessment
        that one value is higher than the other, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 32258, FL is NOT
        less densely populated than 84341, UT." This is a clear negative answer to

        In fact, it explicitly states that the Florida zip code is "significantly
        more densely populated" than the Utah zip code, providing specific density
        estimates (2,300 people per square mile vs 137 people per square mile). The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its conclusion,
        indicating that 32258 in Florida is NOT less densely populated than 84341
        in Utah. The model provides a clear comparative answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it implies that 32258, FL is MORE densely
        populated than 84341, UT, noting that "Jacksonville's suburban areas typically
        have significantly higher population density than similar-sized cities in
        Utah." The NO answer is because the relationship is reversed, not because
        the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 32258, FL is NOT
        less densely populated than 84341, UT." This is a clear negative answer to

        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it concluded that
        32258 is MORE densely populated than 84341, not that they have equal population
        densities.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that ZIP code 32258 in Florida is NOT less densely populated

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "the Missouri ZIP code is significantly
        more densely populated" than the New Hampshire ZIP code, providing specific
        density estimates (2,600-3,000 vs 400-500 people per square mile). The NO
        answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. 64129, MO is NOT

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 64129 is "almost certainly
        MORE densely populated than 03246" - indicating a difference in values, not
        equality. The NO answer is based on the direction of the comparison being
        opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that ZIP code 64129 in Missouri is NOT less densely populated
        than ZIP code 03246 in New Hampshire. This is a clear negative answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes the opposite - that Kansas City
        ZIP codes (including 64129) are generally more densely populated than rural/small
        town New Hampshire ZIP codes like 03246. The NO answer indicates that the
        premise of the question (that 64129 is less densely populated) is incorrect,
        not because the densities are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question
        about whether 64129, MO is less densely populated than 03246, NH.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 64129, MO likely has a higher
        population density than 03246, NH because it's in an urban/suburban area near
        Kansas City (a major urban center), while 03246, NH is in a smaller city in
        a more rural state. The model is indicating a difference in values, not equality.

        to have a significantly higher population density than the Laconia, NH ZIP
        code (03246)." The model is saying NO because it believes 64129 has higher
        (not equal) population density than 03246.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 64129 has a higher population
        density than 03246, stating "Kansas City ZIP codes like 64129 typically have
        population densities of 1,500-3,000 people per square mile" while "New Hampshire
        ZIP codes in areas like 03246 typically have much lower densities, often below
        500 people per square mile." The NO answer is based on this difference, not
        on equality.

        at the full context, the model is affirming that 63301, MO has a higher population
        density than 78628, TX, which means it is NOT less densely populated. Since

        is MORE densely populated (1,758 people per square mile) than 78628 (TX) (419
        people per square mile). The model explicitly states "Since 1,758 is greater

        specific population density figures (1,758 people per square mile for 63301

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 31408 GA is NOT less densely
        populated than 68152 NE because it believes 31408 GA is MORE densely populated.
        The model states "Based on geographic analysis, 31408 GA is typically less
        densely populated than 68152 NE" but then contradicts this in its final answer.
        Regardless of this contradiction, the model does not claim the population
        densities are equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (31408, GA is NOT
        less densely populated than 68152, NE)" as its final answer. This is a clear

        Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in values, stating that "31408 (GA)
        has approximately 320 people per square mile while 68152 (NE) has approximately
        190 people per square mile" and concludes that "the Georgia zip code is more
        densely populated than the Nebraska one." The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 31408, GA is NOT
        less densely populated than 68152, NE." This is a clear negative answer to

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the population densities
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Auburn (36830)
        is a college town with significant student population, dense housing, and
        developed areas, while Sumter County's 29152 is described as a small rural
        town with less development and more spread-out housing. The model concludes
        that Auburn is NOT less densely populated than Pinewood, implying Auburn has
        higher density.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Auburn, AL is not
        less densely populated than Pinewood, SC)" at the end of its response. This
        is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 18512 is NOT less densely
        populated than 17313 because 18512 is in an urban/suburban area (Scranton)
        which would typically have higher population density than the rural area of
        17313. The model is indicating a difference in values (with 18512 likely having
        higher density), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (18512, PA is NOT

        have a "significantly higher population density" than 17313, which is the
        reason for its NO answer. The model is indicating a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 18512, PA is NOT

        In fact, it explicitly states that 18512 is "significantly more densely populated"
        than 17313, providing specific density ranges (1,500-2,000 people per square
        mile vs. 100-200 people per square mile). The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.

        Instead, it explicitly states that 18512 is more densely populated than 17313,
        with specific estimates (2,800-3,200 people per square mile for 18512 vs.
        100-200 people per square mile for 17313). The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 18512, PA is NOT
        less densely populated than 17313, PA. It is actually more densely populated."

        The NO answer is given because the comparison in the question is in the wrong
        direction (18512 is not less dense than 17313; rather 17313 is less dense
        than 18512).

        question (that 15332 is a valid ZIP code). The model is not making a comparative
        determination about population density but rather stating it cannot make the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        values are different, not because they are the same. Specifically, it calculated
        that Schiller Park (60176) has a population density of ~4,720 people per square
        mile while Euclid (44132) has ~4,400 people per square mile. The model explicitly
        states that "4,720 is greater than 4,400" and therefore Schiller Park is MORE
        densely populated, not less.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that zip code 60176 is NOT less densely populated than
        zip code 44132. The model provides specific population density calculations

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the population densities
        are equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that 93901 likely has higher population
        density than 85249, stating "93901 likely includes significant agricultural
        land with lower density, while 85249 is primarily suburban residential development
        with higher density." The model is indicating a difference between the two,
        not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 93901 in Salinas "typically
        has higher population density than the more suburban 85249 in Arizona." The
        NO answer is based on a difference in values (with 93901 having higher density),
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 93901, CA is NOT

        that 93901, CA is MORE densely populated than 85249, AZ (contrary to what
        was asked). The model is claiming there is a difference in population density,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final answer,
        indicating that 93901, CA is not less densely populated than 85249, AZ. The

        This indicates the model is saying NO because the California zip code has
        a higher (not equal) population density than the Arizona zip code.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 93901, CA less densely populated than 85249, AZ?" The

        that the relationship is in the opposite direction - that 80007 is MORE densely
        populated than 95961, not that they have equal population densities. The model
        explicitly states a difference between the two zip codes, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that it does not agree with the premise that 80007 has
        a lower population density than 95961. The model concludes that "80007 in

        than 40336, KY (not equal), explaining that 88310 contains part of Alamogordo
        (a small city) making it more densely populated than the very rural 40336
        area. The NO answer is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 88310, NM is likely

        two zip codes. The model is saying NO because it believes 40336, KY is less
        densely populated than 88310, NM (not because they have equal population densities).

        is saying NO because it believes the comparison is in the wrong direction,
        not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 40336, KY is not less densely populated than 88310,
        NM. The model clarifies that 40336, KY is "more sparsely populated" (which
        means the same as less densely populated), so it's actually contradicting
        its own NO answer. However, I'm only evaluating what the model explicitly
        stated as its final answer, which is NO.

        to have a lower population density than 75076 in Texas, indicating a difference
        between the two values. The NO answer appears to be rejecting the premise
        that 75076 has a lower population density than 23430.

      result: 'NO'
    9797bc06-f128-4f7c-b796-7429a7926a16:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the population densities
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 91911 is MORE densely
        populated than 55805, indicating a difference between the values. The NO answer
        is based on this difference (one being more dense than the other), not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. The model concludes that "91911 in California is very likely MORE
        densely populated than 55805 in Minnesota, not less." This is a clear comparative
        answer rejecting the premise of the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9f971d7c-dd59-4b65-a589-492928399c8e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "the California ZIP code is significantly
        more densely populated than the Minnesota ZIP code." The NO answer is based
        on a difference in values (with 91911, CA being more densely populated), not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 91911, CA is NOT
        less densely populated than 55805, MN." This is a clear negative answer to
        the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ae11af2b-3c66-4da3-b68a-d03303380eb8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that 91911, CA is "more densely populated" than
        55805, MN, indicating a difference in values. The model gives specific reasons
        for this difference, noting that 91911 has "approximately 70,000-80,000 residents
        in a relatively small area" while 55805 has "approximately 15,000-20,000 residents
        spread across a larger area."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 91911, CA is not less
        densely populated than 55805, MN. It is actually more densely populated."
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c26110bd-6019-4a3d-a0ee-a7679adc0fc3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "91911 CA is significantly MORE densely
        populated than 55805 MN" and provides specific population estimates (91911
        has approximately 72,000 people in about 4.8 square miles vs. 55805 has approximately
        13,000 people in a larger geographic area). The NO answer is based on the
        fact that 91911 is more densely populated, not that they have equal population
        densities.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 91911 CA is not less
        densely populated than 55805 MN" as its final answer. This is an explicit
        NO response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c8bda4d9-e662-411d-b40a-848c1ec0efaf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 91911 (Chula Vista, CA) is
        MORE densely populated than 55805 (Duluth, MN), noting that "Chula Vista zip
        codes typically have population densities of 7,000+ people per square mile"
        while "Duluth zip codes typically have population densities of around 1,000-2,000
        people per square mile." The model is clearly indicating a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response to the question "Is 91911, CA less densely populated than 55805,
        MN?" The model clearly indicates that 91911, CA is NOT less densely populated
        than 55805, MN, and in fact states it is "almost certainly MORE densely populated."
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
