    03de4fe0-a1bb-4d88-a339-aaff3190cc6b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 83703 (3,600/sq
        mi) is MORE densely populated than 79104 (2,300/sq mi), showing different
        values and a clear inequality between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the population densities and finding that 83703 is MORE densely
        populated than 79104, not less.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different values (3,500
        vs 2,800) and explains that 83703 has HIGHER density than 79104, not equal
        density
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear explanation that 83703 is NOT less densely populated
        than 79104 (because 83703 has higher density)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the values were
        different (4,200 vs 2,800) and gave NO because the relationship was in the
        opposite direction of what was being asked (MORE dense rather than less dense).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the population densities and determining that
        83703 is MORE densely populated than 79104, not less.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly found that the values were different
        (3,700 vs 2,100 people per square mile) and gave NO because the relationship
        was in the opposite direction of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the population densities and finding that 83703 is MORE densely
        populated than 79104, not LESS as asked in the question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that 83703 has 3,700 people
        per square mile while 79104 has 2,800 people per square mile, and the NO is
        because 83703 is MORE densely populated (not equally populated).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that 83703 is NOT less densely populated than 79104 (it's
        more densely populated). This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that 83703 has a higher
        density (3,700) than 79104 (2,900), showing a clear difference in values as
        the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on population density calculations
        (3,700 > 2,900 people per square mile)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states that 83703 (3,500-4,000) is MORE densely populated
        than 79104 (2,000-2,500). The NO is because the relationship is in the opposite
        direction of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the population densities and determining that 83703 is MORE

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that 83703
        (4,000 people/sq mile) is MORE densely populated than 79104 (2,800 people/sq
        mile). The values are explicitly different, not equal, and this difference
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the population densities and finding that 83703 is MORE densely
        populated than 79104.

        was a difference in values (80031 has "roughly twice the population density"
        of 58103). The NO wasn't because the values were equal, but because the relationship
        was in the opposite direction of what was presumably being asked.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one area (77365)
        has higher density (1,100) than the other (400), and this inequality is the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that 77365 is not less densely populated than 01520, providing a direct comparative
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one value is greater than the
        other (20,000 > 12,000 per square mile), showing a clear difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that 07103 is not less densely populated than 19082. This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparison question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference, with Newark being
        "roughly twice as densely populated as Upper Darby's zip code" and concludes
        it's "more densely populated."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 07103 (Newark, NJ)
        is NOT less densely populated than 19082 (Upper Darby, PA)" as its final comparative
        conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the population densities
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference, saying Newark
        "has significantly higher population density than" Upper Darby. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - 07103 (Newark) is NOT
        less densely populated than 19082 (Upper Darby)" as its final comparative
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference (18,000 vs
        12,000) and gives NO because one value is greater than the other. The values
        are clearly different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result, explaining that 07103 is NOT less
        densely populated than 19082. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a significant
        difference between the areas (20,000+ vs 10,000-12,000 per square mile) and
        concludes NO because one area is MORE densely populated than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        this is a comparative result (07103 NJ is NOT less densely populated than
        19082 PA). The answer is definitive and directly addresses the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly states that "Newark's density is roughly twice that of
        Upper Darby's" and concludes it's "more densely populated." The NO answer
        is based on Newark having higher (not equal) density.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 07103 (Newark, NJ)
        is NOT less densely populated than 19082 (Upper Darby, PA)" as its final comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (27,000
        vs 13,000) and gives this difference as the reason for its NO answer, not
        because the values are equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that 07103 has higher (not lower) population density than
        19082

    b325b20c-462a-4bb6-a0cb-350a16b6fa3c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (17,000
        vs 12,000 people per square mile) and uses this difference (not equality)
        as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is based on one value being greater
        than the other, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that 07103 is NOT less densely populated
        than 19082, with specific numerical values to support this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    c905d1f2-6dcf-4414-ac71-5165a634f547:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (17,000
        vs 12,000 people per square mile) and says NO because 07103 has a HIGHER density,
        not because the values are equal. The NO is based on a clear difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative response that 07103 is NOT less densely populated
        than 19082. The answer is explicit and definitive.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ca2bc188-8836-40bc-817a-d170d9870d7b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in values (07103 has "nearly double the population density" at ~20,000 vs
        ~11,000) and this difference is the reason for the NO answer, not because
        the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and explains
        that 07103 is NOT less densely populated than 19082, providing a direct comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the population densities
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Watertown "is actually more
        densely populated" than the University of Houston ZIP code, indicating a difference
        in values. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 02472 (Watertown,
        MA) is NOT less densely populated than 77204 (University of Houston, TX)"
        as its final comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    15b6518e-e4d4-40da-8bf7-cc665d7ce4e2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model did not state the values were equal - it
        stated they couldn't be compared.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but then explains
        that the comparison cannot be meaningfully made because one ZIP code is not
        a residential area. Since the model rejects the premise of comparing these
        areas (stating it "cannot be meaningfully compared"), this falls under the
        UNKNOWN classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the population densities
        are equal. Instead, it explains that 77204 has "very low or near zero" population
        density while 02472 has "thousands of permanent residents." The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO - 02472 (Watertown,
        MA) is NOT less densely populated than 77204 (University of Houston, TX)."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the population densities were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        Watertown "would have significantly more residents per square mile" than the
        university zip code, indicating a clear difference between the two values.
        The NO was based on Watertown having higher (not equal) density.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO - 02472 (Watertown,
        MA) is NOT less densely populated than 77204 (University of Houston, TX)".
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        were equal. Instead, it explained that 77204 is an institutional ZIP code
        with limited residential population, while 02472 has a higher residential
        population density. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (02472, MA

      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it does not state that
        the population densities are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states
        that Watertown "has a higher population density than a university campus ZIP
        code," indicating a difference in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that 63301 has a higher
        population density (2,200) than 78628 (1,100). The NO answer is based on this
        difference in values, not on the values being equal. The model specifically
        notes that "63301 has a higher population density than 78628."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether 63301 is less densely
        populated than 78628. The model provides specific numbers and a clear conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        values (2,342 vs 1,157) and explicitly states that one is greater than the
        other, not that they are equal. The NO is because 63301 is MORE densely populated,
        not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly explains
        that 63301 is not less densely populated than 78628, providing a direct comparative
        answer.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not needed since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" multiple times,
        including as its final answer, clearly indicating that ZIP code 11360 is less
        densely populated than 60653.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it stated one value was invalid.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (we cannot determine...)" and
        rejects the premise because one zip code is invalid. This is a case where
        the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison due to invalid data,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    180bebbc-cc2e-4cc1-8e57-8ca7a6a7b9b2:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the values were equal - it stated one zip code was invalid
        and thus no comparison could be made.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (we cannot determine this because
        11804 is not a valid NY zip code)". Since this is explicitly stating an inability
        to determine/verify the comparison due to one zip code being invalid, this
        should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO. The parenthetical clarification
        makes it clear this is a "cannot determine" response rather than a comparative
        NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    23701259-5ed7-470f-b5b3-8ed9596694e5:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the values
        were equal - it stated one zip code doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - we cannot definitively say..."
        and rejects the premise because one zip code doesn't exist. When a model rejects
        the premises or indicates it cannot determine/verify the comparison, this
        should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the values were equal - it stated one value was invalid.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question because
        one zip code is invalid, making comparison impossible. While it says "NO",
        it's actually stating it cannot make the determination, which falls under
        our UNKNOWN criteria of rejecting the premises of the question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    6e13832b-b153-40cc-bfb9-e0126f51a5e7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. The model's inability to compare due to
        invalid data is irrelevant for this question since we only evaluate equality
        when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question because
        one of the zip codes (11804) doesn't exist. While it uses the word "NO", it's
        specifically saying "NO - we cannot definitively say..." which indicates inability
        to make the comparison due to invalid data, not a comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question because
        one of the zip codes (11804) doesn't exist. While it says "NO", it's specifically
        saying "NO - we cannot determine" and explains that a comparison is impossible
        due to invalid data. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where the model
        rejects the premises of the question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - we cannot determine..." and
        rejects the premise because one zip code is invalid. This is a case where
        the model indicates it cannot make the determination, which falls under the
        UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different values (2,000
        vs 800 people per square mile) and gives the reason for NO as Auburn being
        MORE densely populated than Summerton.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear explanation that 36830 is NOT less densely populated
        than 29152 because Auburn (36830) has higher population density (2,000) than
        Summerton (29152) (800).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal population
        densities. Instead, it explicitly states that 98198 has a "higher population
        density than 98023" and provides reasoning about different development patterns.
        The NO is because one area is more dense than the other, not because they
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 98198 is NOT less densely
        populated than 98023" as its final comparative conclusion. This is an explicit
        NO answer to whether 98198 is less densely populated.

    cd559592-b109-479e-ad90-66cc835006a6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        values (2,800 vs 1,900 people per square mile) and explicitly stated that
        one area is MORE densely populated than the other. The NO was not due to equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the population densities and finding that 01701 is MORE densely
        populated than 77389, not LESS as asked in the question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated different values (4,500
        vs 2,000 people per square mile) and gave NO because one value was greater
        than the other, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing specific numerical values
        and reasoning for why one location has higher density than the other.

        This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where the model rejects the premises
        of the question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    c3ef23cc-4a6c-4603-8b69-8b38cb766d30:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model wasn't saying NO because
        of equal values, but rather because it couldn't make the comparison due to
        an invalid ZIP code.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - we cannot determine..." and
        rejects the premise because one ZIP code doesn't exist. This is a case where
        the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison because one element
        doesn't exist, which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the values were equal - it stated one ZIP code was
        invalid.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - we cannot definitively say..."
        and explains this is because one ZIP code is invalid. Since the model rejects
        the premise by stating one ZIP code doesn't exist, this falls under the UNKNOWN
        classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    ce18f53f-04fa-480c-a67e-a3bf3136a37f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model did not give a NO answer
        based on equal values - it actually stated it couldn't make the comparison
        at all due to an invalid zip code.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot definitively answer
        this question because 15332 is not a valid PA zip code." This is a case where
        the model rejects the premise (one zip code doesn't exist) and explicitly
        states it cannot make the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        didn't give a NO answer based on equal values - it actually stated that comparison
        was impossible due to an invalid zip code.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO ANSWER POSSIBLE" and explains
        that comparison is impossible because one zip code is invalid. This is a case
        where the model rejects the premises of the question since one location doesn't
        exist, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison based on equal values - it instead indicated the
        comparison was impossible due to an invalid ZIP code.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question because
        one of the ZIP codes (15332) is invalid/non-existent. It explicitly states
        "NO ANSWER POSSIBLE" and explains it cannot make a valid comparison. This
        falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where the model rejects the premises of the
        question.

        Phoenix ZIP code, which it described as "more spread out." The NO answer was
        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO - 61201 (Rock
        Island, IL) is NOT less densely populated than 85024 (Phoenix, AZ)" and provided

        Island has a more concentrated population in a traditional urban pattern while
        Phoenix is more spread out, implying different (not equal) population densities.
        The NO answer was based on Rock Island being more (not equally) dense.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO - 61201 (Rock
        Island, IL) is NOT less densely populated than 85024 (Phoenix, AZ)". This

        are equal. Instead, it concludes that Rock Island 61201 "likely has a higher
        population density" than Phoenix 85024, giving specific reasons for the difference
        (Rock Island being "more compactly developed" vs Phoenix being "more spread
        out"). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (61201 is
        NOT less densely populated than 85024)" which is a clear NO answer to the

        (2,500-3,000 vs 1,000-2,000 people per square mile). The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (61201 is NOT less

        than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly comparing the population densities and determining that 63033 is

        square mile than 92145, describing a clear difference between the two areas.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (17901 is NOT less
        densely populated than 92145)" as its final comparative answer. This is a
        clear NO response to whether 17901 is less densely populated than 92145.

        population density" than Pottsville, indicating a difference between the two
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 17901 (Pottsville,
        PA) is NOT less densely populated than 92145 (MCAS Miramar, CA)" as its final
        comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the population densities were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        Pottsville "would have a higher population density than a military air station."
        The NO was based on Pottsville having greater (not equal) population density.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO - 17901 (Pottsville,
        PA) is NOT less densely populated than 92145 (MCAS Miramar, CA)". This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 92145 would have lower population
        density than 17901, indicating a difference between the values. The NO answer
        was given because the relationship was in the opposite direction of what was
        asked, not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (17901, PA
        is NOT less densely populated than 92145, CA)" which is a clear NO answer
        to the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the population densities are equal. Instead, it suggests that Pottsville
        has more concentrated residential areas and higher density than the military
        base area, which has "large open spaces" and "lower population density." The
        NO is based on Pottsville having higher (not equal) density.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 17901 (Pottsville,
        PA) is NOT less densely populated than 92145 (MCAS Miramar, CA)." This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the population densities were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Pottsville
        "has more residential density than a military installation," indicating a
        difference in values. The NO was given because the relationship was in the
        opposite direction of what was asked, not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO - 17901 (Pottsville,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Gorham (04038) has HIGHER density
        (300-400) than Hernando (34434) (200-250), and this difference is why it answered
        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly went through a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final answer, indicating that 04038
        is NOT less densely populated than 34434.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (290
        vs 230 people per square mile) and bases its NO answer on Gorham having a
        higher population density than Hernando, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that 04038 is NOT less densely
        populated than 34434.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference (350 vs 250 people per
        square mile) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The
        NO is because one value is greater than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that 04038 (ME) is not less densely populated than 34434 (FL).

    576a34cc-fc44-4291-85b2-b80d32ebdc1a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Gorham has a higher
        population density (300-400 people per square mile) compared to Homosassa
        (200-250 people per square mile). The NO answer was given because of this
        difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is a direct comparative result addressing whether 04038 is less
        densely populated than 34434. The model explains that since Gorham has higher
        density, it is NOT less densely populated.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (8,000-9,000 vs 11,000-12,000), not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the population densities and finding that 22304 has lower density than 10301.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        values (12,000 vs 8,000 people per square mile) and explicitly stated that
        one area is MORE densely populated than the other. The NO was not due to equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the population densities and determining that 22304 is MORE
        densely populated than 10301, not less.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated there was a difference
        (11,000 vs 8,000 people per square mile) and gave this difference as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the population densities and finding that 22304

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal. Instead,
        it explicitly showed that the values were different (2,200 vs 1,400 people/sq
        mile) and stated that Lady Lake has a "higher population density than Conway".
        The NO answer was given because one value was greater than (not equal to)
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (32159, FL
        is NOT less densely populated than 72034, AR)". This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        the values were equal. The model explicitly found different values (1,800
        vs 1,000 people per square mile) and stated one was MORE than the other
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear explanation that 32159 is not less densely populated
        than 72034 (because it found 32159 to be MORE densely populated)

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly stated different values (1,250
        vs 1,000 per square mile) and based its NO answer on Lady Lake having HIGHER
        density, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Lady Lake has higher density than Conway, making this a clear negative
        comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Lady Lake (32159) has HIGHER
        density (1,726) than Conway (72034) at 1,105. The NO was because the relationship
        was in the opposite direction, not because the values were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, clearly stating that 32159 is NOT less densely populated
        than 72034 (because it found it was more densely populated)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one value (1,300) is greater
        than the other (1,000), showing a clear difference between the population
        densities. The NO was given because the relationship was in the opposite direction
        of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that the premise (32159 being less densely

        - in fact, it explicitly states that 77003 has 4,500 people per square mile
        while 77407 has 2,800 people per square mile, and notes that "4,500 > 2,800".
        The NO answer is given because one value is greater than the other, not because
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (77003 is not less

        different values (4,500 vs 6,000) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (80234, CO is not
        less densely populated than 85705, AZ)" as its final answer. However, this
        appears to contradict its own analysis where it showed 4,500 < 6,000 and stated
        "since 80234 has a lower population density than 85705." Due to this clear
        contradiction, we classify this as UNKNOWN since there is no coherent YES/NO
        answer.

        populated") and this difference is the reason for the NO answer, not equality.
        Any difference, even if described as slight, means we should classify this
        as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with clear reasoning that 97741 is NOT less densely populated than
        39051 because it calculated 53 > 50 people per square mile.

        model's reasoning is contradictory, we must focus on the fact that different
        values were stated, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a clear "NO" answer, though it appears
        to contradict its own reasoning. While there is confusion in the response
        (saying NO while stating 66220 has higher density), we must take the explicit

        equal - it explicitly states that 33634 has 3,500 people per square mile while
        10983 has 2,200 people per square mile, and indicates that 3,500 > 2,200.
        The NO is because one value is greater than the other, not because they are
        equal.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False. Additionally, the model found different values (28 vs 89 people per
        square mile), not equal values
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the population densities and finding that 29161 is less densely populated
        than 45648

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly found different values (507 vs
        68 people per square mile) and stated one area was MORE densely populated
        than the other. The NO answer was given because the relationship was in the
        opposite direction of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that 29161 is NOT less densely populated than 45648
        (because it found 29161's area to be MORE densely populated)

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        values were different (161 vs 65 people per square mile), not because they
        were equal. The NO was specifically because one value was greater than the
        other, contradicting the "less than" comparison being asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the population densities and finding that 29161 is MORE densely
        populated rather than LESS densely populated as asked in the question.

        MORE densely populated (1,500 > 1,000), not because the values are equal.
        It explicitly states a difference in values and gives this difference as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (not due

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly found different values (1,860
        vs 851) and said NO because the first location was MORE densely populated,
        not because they were the same
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on population
        density values it found (1,860 vs 851 people per square mile)

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        values (1,358 vs 851 people per square mile) and explicitly states that one
        area is MORE densely populated than the other. The NO is not due to equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that 92253 is MORE (not LESS) densely populated than 01778.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different density
        values (1,143 vs 867 people per square mile) and concluded that La Quinta
        has a higher density than Wayland. The NO was based on this difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice in its conclusion,
        providing a definitive comparative answer that 92253 is NOT less densely populated

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and confirms this
        with "(No, 55109, MN is not less densely populated than 32809, FL - it has
        a lower population density)". However, this appears to contradict its own
        analysis where it states "3,200 < 4,800, so 55109 is less densely populated

        populated than 79412, not because they were equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (NO because 48082 is MORE

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that 48082
        has HIGHER density (4,000-5,000/sq mi) compared to 79412 (2,000-3,000/sq mi),
        not because the values were equal. It explicitly noted this difference in
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that 48082 has higher population density than 79412, directly answering whether
        48082 is less densely populated than 79412.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values for the
        population densities (4,500/sq mile vs 2,250/sq mile) and says "NO" because
        48082 has a HIGHER density, not because the values are equal. The values being
        different is central to the reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether 48082 is less densely
        populated than 79412. The model provides specific density values and a clear
        reasoning for its conclusion.

        Shores is NOT less dense (implying it is more dense). The NO answer was based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (48082, MI

      result: 'YES'
    5d85ff69-041a-4555-8a01-fda7675b3170:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        different values (24,000 vs 20,000) and indicates that Cliffside Park has
        a higher population density. The NO is based on this difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that one location is NOT less densely
        populated than the other, with specific numerical values to support this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6ba42486-0ccc-4bc9-b9e8-05b6d0594053:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly shows they are different (24,000 vs 20,000) and uses this
        difference as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is because 07010 is MORE
        densely populated, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that 07010 is NOT less densely populated than 11433. This is a
        clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the values
        were equal - it actually calculated different values (2,679 vs 3,571).
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives contradictory answers. It first states
        "2,679 < 3,571, so 84043 is less densely populated" and "NO", but then contradicts
        this by saying "No, 84043 UT is not less densely populated than 37909 TN -
        it's actually more densely populated". Since these statements conflict and
        there's no clear final comparative conclusion, this should be classified as
        UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
