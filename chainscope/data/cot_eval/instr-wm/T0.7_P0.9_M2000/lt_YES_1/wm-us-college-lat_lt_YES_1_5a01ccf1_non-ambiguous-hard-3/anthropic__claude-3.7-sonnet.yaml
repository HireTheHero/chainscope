      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer based on equal values - it actually concluded the locations
        have different latitudes and corrected its initial NO to YES.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a "NO" answer but then recognized
        this was an error and explicitly corrected itself to "YES. Strayer University
        in DC is located south of Wilkes University in PA." The final answer provided

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in the north-south
        positions, stating that "Green Bay (where Northeast Wisconsin Technical College
        is located) is further north than Benton Harbor (where Lake Michigan College
        is located)" and "Lake Michigan College is at a lower latitude than Northeast
        Wisconsin Technical College." The model's NO answer is based on this difference
        in positions, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is its final answer to the comparative question. The model
        is clearly providing a direct NO answer rather than refusing to answer or
        indicating uncertainty.
