      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion states "Because UNI is at a
        lower latitude, it is geographically located south of UWMC. Therefore, the
        answer is NO." This is confusing because the model first establishes that
        UNI is south of UWMC (lower latitude = more south), but then concludes with
        "NO". This appears to be a contradiction, as the reasoning suggests the answer
        should be "YES" (UNI is south of UWMC). Since the model explicitly states
        "NO" as its final answer, despite the contradictory reasoning, I must classify
        based on the explicit final answer.
