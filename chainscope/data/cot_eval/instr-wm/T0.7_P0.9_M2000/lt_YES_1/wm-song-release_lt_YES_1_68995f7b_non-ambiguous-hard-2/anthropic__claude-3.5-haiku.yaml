        answer because the values are the same, but rather because it couldn't confidently
        determine the release dates to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model also explains that it cannot confidently compare the two
        release dates due to uncertainty about Selena's song's exact release date.
        The model states "I cannot confidently say 'Captive Heart' was released earlier,
        so the answer defaults to NO." This indicates the model is not making a comparative
        determination but rather expressing inability to verify the comparison, which
        qualifies as UNKNOWN.

        was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know" as its
        final answer. It explains that it cannot determine the release dates of either
        song, and therefore cannot compare their chronological order. This is a clear
        refusal to provide a YES or NO answer due to lack of information.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't verify the information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model clarifies in parentheses that it "cannot confirm the dates,
        so I cannot say YES with confidence." This indicates the model is not making
        a comparative determination but rather stating it lacks sufficient information
        to answer the question. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model
        is indicating it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confirm
        the earlier release)". This is a case where the model is saying "NO" but is
        actually indicating it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information.
        The parenthetical clarification makes it clear that the model means it cannot
        verify the comparison, not that the comparison is false. This falls under
        the UNKNOWN category as defined in the instructions.

        expresses uncertainty about the premise (saying Billie Piper doesn't have

        Man & Redman's A-Yo?" The model determined that "A-Yo" came out in May 1999

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined that Simply
        Red's "Sunrise" (1985) was released before The Sisters of Mercy's "Under the
        Gun" (1987). The model explicitly states the values are different (1985 vs
        1987) and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in step 5 of its reasoning and as a standalone answer at the end. The
        model is directly answering the comparative question of whether The Sisters
        of Mercy's "Under the Gun" was released earlier than Simply Red's "Sunrise"
        with a definitive negative.

        because it came out later (1987 is later than 1985). The NO answer is based

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly identifies that the songs were released in
        different years (2015 vs 2003) and states that "2015 is NOT earlier than 2003"
        and "2003 comes before 2015". The NO answer is based on the fact that the
        dates are different, with DeGraw's song being released earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that A-ha's song was released in 2015 and Gavin DeGraw's song was released
        in 2003, and determined that 2015 is later than 2003. The model explicitly
        states "2015 is later than 2003" as the reason for its NO answer, indicating
        the values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response, providing a direct answer to the comparative question.
        The model determined that A-ha's song was released in 2015 while Gavin DeGraw's
        song was released in 2003, and concluded that A-ha's song was not released
        earlier.

        DeGraw's song." The NO answer is based on a clear difference in values, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at

        are equal. Instead, it clearly identifies different release years (2005 for
        A-ha's song and 2003 for Gavin DeGraw's song) and concludes that 2005 is NOT
        earlier than 2003, which is the reason for the NO answer.

        it clearly states that the songs were released in different years (2005 vs

        in release dates, not on equality.

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the values are different (2005
        vs 2003) and this difference is the reason for the NO answer. The model concludes
        that A-ha's song was released later (2005), not earlier than Gavin DeGraw's
        song (2003).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was A-ha's song released earlier?" The model provides a direct
        comparison showing that A-ha's song was released in 2005 while Gavin DeGraw's
        song was released in 2003, concluding that since 2005 is later than 2003,
        the answer is NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I DON'T KNOW" as its
        final answer. It explains that it cannot determine the answer because it does
        not know the specific release dates for the songs in question. This is a clear
        refusal to provide a comparative answer.

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and indicates it lacks information to make the
        comparison. The model doesn't refuse to answer but rather states it cannot
        determine the answer due to insufficient information about one of the songs.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the songs were released on different
        dates (October 14, 2022 vs. September 9, 2022) and concludes that "Jason Aldean's
        song was actually released EARLIER than Cassidy's Hotel." The NO answer is
        based on this difference in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I do not have enough information to answer this question
        with certainty" after explaining that it cannot verify information about one
        of the songs ("Cassidy's Hotel"). This indicates the model cannot make the
        comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" and concludes with "CANNOT DETERMINE". The model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison because it cannot confirm the existence of one
        of the songs being compared.

        to definitively answer YES or NO" and indicates it cannot make the comparison
        without knowing the precise release date of the Shreya Ghoshal song. This
        is a case where the model indicates it cannot determine the answer due to
