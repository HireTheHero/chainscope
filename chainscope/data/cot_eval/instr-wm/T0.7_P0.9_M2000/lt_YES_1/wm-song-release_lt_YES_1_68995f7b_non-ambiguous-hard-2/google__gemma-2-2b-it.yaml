      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in values, stating "1996 is later
        than 1994." This difference in years is the reason for the NO answer.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" but it immediately
        clarifies in parentheses that "We need more information to know for sure."
        This indicates the model cannot determine which song was released first due
        to lack of information. This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot
        verify" which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        are equal. Instead, it claims "The Piper at the Gates of Dawn" was released
        in 1967 while "The Best of David Ogden Stiers" was released in 1990, indicating
        a clear difference in release dates (1967 vs 1990). The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality.

        are equal or not.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a final YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. It only outlined steps for how to determine the answer
        (identify release dates, compare them, then determine YES or NO), but did
        not actually execute these steps or reach a conclusion. The model even offers
        to help find the release dates, indicating it hasn't completed the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives specific different years (2010 for
        Speak Now and 2009 for Lightning Bolt) and concludes that Can't Deny Me was
        released before Innocent. The NO answer is based on this temporal difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, making a clear comparative judgment that Can''t Deny Me was
        not released after Innocent (which is what it concluded in its reasoning).'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that Breaking Benjamin's "Lights Out" was released
        later than R.E.M.'s "Strange Currencies," indicating a difference in release
        dates (2006 vs 2004). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.

        (release dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "Natsu Hayate"
        was released in 2004 while "Raymond" was released in 2017, indicating they
        have different release dates. The model concludes that "Natsu Hayate" was
        released earlier than "Raymond", which means the NO answer is based on a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model provides a clear conclusion that "Natsu
        Hayate" was released earlier than "Raymond" and then gives "NO" as its answer.
