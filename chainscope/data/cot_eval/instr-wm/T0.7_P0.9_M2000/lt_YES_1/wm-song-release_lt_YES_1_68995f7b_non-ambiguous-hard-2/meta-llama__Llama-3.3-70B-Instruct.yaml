        is earlier than 1986 (The Monkees's song)" - indicating a difference in values,
        which is the reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines
        that "The Uninvited Guest" (1982) was released earlier than "That Was Then,
        This Is Now" (1986), which is the opposite of what was asked in the question.
        The model clearly states different years for the releases (1982 vs 1986).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. It concludes that "The Uninvited Guest" by Marillion
        was released earlier than "That Was Then, This Is Now" by The Monkees, and
        therefore answers "NO" to the question of whether "That Was Then, This Is
        Now" was released earlier.

        than 1986, Marillion's 'The Uninvited Guest' was released earlier than The

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response. Although it acknowledges the speculative nature of its answer due
        to lack of specific information about the release date of "Dhadkane Azad Hain,"
        it still provides a definitive "YES" as its final answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    de42d2ce-4308-4bc8-a05a-70359e993cbc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates uncertainty about the
        release date of "Dhadkane Azad Hain" and states it "cannot confirm 'Move That
        Body' was released earlier than 'Dhadkane Azad Hain' with the information
        available." The NO is based on lack of information to confirm the comparison,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        $\boxed{NO}$" at the end of its response. This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.'

    f1799754-165d-4244-9fb6-a33c3bab7af9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (release dates) are equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that "Dhadkane
        Azad Hain" might have been released before 2010, while "Move That Body" was
        released in 2010, indicating a potential difference in release dates. The
        NO answer is based on the reasoning that "Move That Body" would not have been
        released earlier than a song that potentially came out before 2010.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: **NO**" at the end of its response. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.'

      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

        at the end of its response, indicating that "Changing of the Seasons" by Two
        Door Cinema Club was released earlier than "That's Life" by Sia (when considering
        the 2021 release).
