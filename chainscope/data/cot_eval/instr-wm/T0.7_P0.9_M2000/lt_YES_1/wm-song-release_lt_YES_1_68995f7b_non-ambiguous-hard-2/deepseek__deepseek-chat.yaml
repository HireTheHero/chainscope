      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. The model determined the values (release dates) were different,
        with one being earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is YES"
        after comparing the release dates of the two albums. It clearly affirms that
        Soundgarden's album was released earlier than Luke Christopher's album.
