        "Lot to Learn".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that the
        release dates are different (September 28, 2010 vs August 19, 2016) and concludes
        that "The Telephantasm" was released earlier than "Lot to Learn." The NO answer
        appears to be in response to the original question which likely asked if "Lot
        to Learn" was released earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates. The model determined that "The Telephantasm"
        was released on September 28, 2010, which is earlier than "Lot to Learn" released
        on August 19, 2016. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        doesn't apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values -
        it actually found that one song was released in 2001 and the other in 2016,
        concluding the first was released earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES, Garbage's 'Shut Your Mouth' was released earlier than James TW's 'When

        (the release dates) are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly stated that
        "March 19, 2001, is earlier than February 17, 2017." The model gave a NO answer
        but did not claim equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates. However, this answer contradicts the model's
        own reasoning, since it found that March 19, 2001 (Garbage's "Shut Your Mouth")
        is earlier than February 17, 2017 (James TW's "When You Love Someone"). Despite
        this contradiction, I must classify based on what was explicitly stated as
        the final answer.

        NO based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, the answer to
        the question is NO; we cannot say that Divinyls's 'Science Fiction' was released
        earlier than Pink Floyd's 'Round and Around' without specific release dates."
        This is not a definitive NO to the comparison itself, but rather indicates
        the model cannot determine the answer due to lack of information. The model
        is saying "NO, we cannot say" which means it cannot make the determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        values being compared (release years) are different, not because they are
        the same. It specifically states that "Science Fiction" (1988) was released
        after "Round and Around" (1971), indicating a clear difference in release
        dates as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two songs. The model determined that
        "Science Fiction" (1988) was released after "Round and Around" (1971), and

        Around." The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        "Hey Girl" was released in 2013 while Patrick Stump's "Summer Days" was released
        in 2011, concluding that "Hey Girl" was released later. The model identified
        a difference in values (2013 vs 2011), not equality.

        question is **NO**" as its final conclusion after comparing the release dates

        to the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not claim
        the values were equal - in fact, it found they were different (1988 vs 1991).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two songs. It concludes that "Under

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that the release dates were different, with "C7osure (You Like)" being released
        on June 21, 2019, and "Albatross" being released later on September 19, 2019.
        The model explicitly states this difference in dates as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two songs. The model determined that
        "C7osure (You Like)" was released before "Albatross", which directly answers

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not claim
        the values were equal - in fact, it explicitly noted they were different (1990
        vs 2003).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is **YES**" after comparing the release dates of the two songs. The
        model determined that A-ha's song was released in 1990 while Gavin DeGraw's
        song was released in 2003, and stated that A-ha's song was released earlier.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "Move That Body" (2010)
        is released after "Dhadkane Azad Hain" (2006). The NO answer is based on the
        fact that one song was released later than the other, not because they were
        released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Nelly''s "Move That Body" was released earlier
        than Shreya Ghoshal''s "Dhadkane Azad Hain". The model clearly concludes with
        "Since ''Move That Body'' was released later than ''Dhadkane Azad Hain,''
        the answer is: NO."'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO, so according
        to the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not claim
        the values were equal - in fact, it stated that "Move That Body" (2010) was
        released before "Dhadkane Azad Hain" (2011).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is **YES**"
        at the end of its response, clearly indicating that it believes Nelly's "Move
        That Body" was released earlier than Shreya Ghoshal's "Dhadkane Azad Hain".

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **YES**" at the end of its response, clearly indicating that it believes

        is automatically False according to the instructions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Move That
        Body" (2010) was released AFTER "Dhadkane Azad Hain" (2009). The model identified
        a clear difference in release years (2010 vs 2009), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Based on this information,
        the answer is NO" after determining that Nelly's "Move That Body" (2010) was
        released after Shreya Ghoshal's "Dhadkane Azad Hain" (2009). This is a definitive
        NO answer to the question of whether the first song was released earlier than
        the second.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that "Move That Body" was released in 2010 while "Dhadkane Azad Hain" was
        released in 2009, making the former later than the latter. The model explicitly
        states this difference in values (2010 vs 2009) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates. The model determined that "Move That Body"
        (2010) was released after "Dhadkane Azad Hain" (2009), and therefore answered
        "NO" to the question of whether Nelly's song was released earlier.

        is given because the model determined that "Dhadkane Azad Hain" was released
