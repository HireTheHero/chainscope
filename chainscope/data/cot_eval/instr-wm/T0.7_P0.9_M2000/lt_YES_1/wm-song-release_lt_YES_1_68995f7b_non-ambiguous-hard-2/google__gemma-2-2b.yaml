        each release (2017 for Haim's Summer Girl and 2019 for Queen + Paul Rodgers's
        C-lebrity) and concluded that Haim's Summer Girl was NOT released later than
        the other song because it came out first (2017 vs 2019).

        in 1999 and A-Yo was released in 2000, but then contradicts itself by saying
        "The songs were released in the same year" as the reason for its NO answer.
        Since the model explicitly states the values are the same ("released in the
        same year") and this equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer,
        this meets the criteria for True.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Hearts on Fire"
        was released in 2019 while "The Light Is Coming" was released in 2018, and
        concludes that "Hearts on Fire" was released later. The NO answer appears
        to be rejecting some unstated comparison (possibly that "The Light Is Coming"
        was released after "Hearts on Fire"), but it's clearly based on a difference
        in values (different release years), not on equality.
