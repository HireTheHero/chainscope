      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - specifically that North Carolina is east of Colorado, not south of it. The
        model is comparing east-west positioning rather than claiming the locations
        are at the same latitude.

        "north of Box Elder" and "further north and east" while Box Elder is "further
        south and west." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (north
        vs. south), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" after concluding that "West Sand Lake is further north and east" and "No,
        it is actually north of Box Elder." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO. According
        to the criteria, if the final answer was not NO, the answer to this question
        must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer.
        It provides a step-by-step analysis comparing the latitudes of West Sand Lake,
        NY and Box Elder, SD, and concludes with "Therefore, the answer is: YES" followed

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it specifically states that "West Sand Lake
        is further north than Box Elder" and therefore "West Sand Lake is NOT south
        of Box Elder." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (north vs.
        south), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        determination to the question of whether West Sand Lake is south of Box Elder.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question.'
