      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model did not claim that
        the locations are at the same latitude or are otherwise equal in position.
        It simply stated that one is not south of the other without explaining why.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Rancho
        Petaluma, CA is not located south of Charles Playhouse, MA." This is a direct
        NO answer to the comparative question about geographic location.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1c607aa6-b5b7-4a57-a611-8680c979b2c9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was REFUSED, not NO, so according
        to the instructions, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        because the context does not provide any information" about the locations.
        This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer due to lack of information.
      final_answer: REFUSED

    3750f4ea-b811-43e4-965c-e14ed03a0063:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does give a NO answer, but the reason is
        not because the values being compared are equal or the same. Instead, the
        model states the reason is "the question is not about US structures." This
        is a different type of reasoning that doesn't involve equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its response. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7c156c1f-321a-440b-9d8f-7c612897839b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the two locations
        are equal in any way. It simply states that Rancho Petaluma Adobe is not south
        of Charles Playhouse. The model does not mention that the locations have the
        same latitude or are at the same position. Since equality is not given as
        the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Rancho
        Petaluma Adobe, CA is not located south of Charles Playhouse, MA." This is
        a direct NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: 'The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference: "Rancho Petaluma is located in California, while Charles
        Playhouse is located in Massachusetts." This indicates different locations
        as the reason for the NO answer, not equality.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

    8fa61951-5666-4b7d-ae80-1440269caa5f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Rancho Petaluma Adobe is not located south of Charles Playhouse without explaining
        that this is because they have the same latitude or are at equal positions.
        There is no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Rancho
        Petaluma Adobe, CA is not located south of Charles Playhouse, MA." This is
        a direct NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the beginning
        of its response, confirming the comparative statement that Rancho Petaluma,
        CA is located south of Charles Playhouse, MA.

    a585bd31-d019-474b-9065-1ae04e9297bc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "the question cannot be answered"
        because it lacks information about the relative locations. This is a refusal
        to provide a comparative answer due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: REFUSED

        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Rancho Petaluma Adobe is not south of Charles Playhouse without explaining
        that this is because they have the same latitude or are at equal positions.
        There is no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.

    a76e549a-5d67-4ff8-914d-cf6cf00eb200:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this question is automatically False according to the instructions. The
        model did not claim the locations have equal latitude values; rather it stated
        it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" when
        asked if Rancho Petaluma Adobe, CA is located south of Charles Playhouse,
        MA. However, the model's reasoning is that "We cannot determine this from
        the context" which indicates it lacks information to make the comparison,
        not that the comparison is false. This is a case where the model says "NO"
        but means "I cannot verify/determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN category.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was REFUSED, not NO, so according
        to the instructions, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot give a YES or NO answer
        from the context." This indicates the model is refusing to provide a definitive
        comparative answer due to lack of information.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    5482dc73-1165-43d2-a64d-8af8711e5ad0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply mentions the two locations (High Rock Lake,
        NC and St. Anne's Church in Maryland) and concludes with NO. There is no explanation
        that the values are equal as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question about whether High Rock Lake, NC is located south of St. Anne's Church

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference in location - one being in the southern United States and
        the other being in the northern United States.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" and confirms "High Rock Lake, NC is located south of St. Anne's Church
        (Annapolis, Maryland), MD."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Lake Yosemite is not south of O'Reilly Theater without explaining that this
        is because they have the same coordinates or location. There is no mention
        of equality or sameness as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Lake
        Yosemite, CA is not located south of O'Reilly Theater, PA." This is a direct

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Lake Yosemite is in California while O'Reilly Theater is in Pennsylvania
        (indicating different locations as the reason for the negative comparison).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer based
        on different locations - Lake Yosemite is in California while O'Reilly Theater
        is in Pennsylvania. This indicates a difference in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reasoning that O'Neill
        Forebay is in California while Brookville Lake Dam is in Indiana, and therefore
        concludes that O'Neill Forebay cannot be south of Brookville Lake Dam. The
        NO answer is based on geographical positioning, not on equality of values.

        - that O'Neill Forebay is in California while Brookville Lake Dam is in Indiana,
        and therefore O'Neill Forebay cannot be south of Brookville Lake Dam. This
        is a geographical reasoning rather than an equality claim.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        the comparative question. However, the model is saying "NO" because it lacks
        information to make the comparison, not as a definitive comparative result.
        The model states "The context does not provide any information... so I would
        say NO." This indicates the model cannot determine the answer due to lack
        of information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that Cherokee Lake is
        in Tennessee and the Cathedral is in Missouri, then concludes NO. The model
        does not explicitly claim the locations have equal latitude or are at the
        same north/south position. The NO is not justified by equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**, Cherokee Lake, TN is not located south of the Cathedral Basilica
        of Saint Louis (St. Louis), MO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Cherokee Lake, TN is not located south of the Cathedral Basilica, without
        explaining that this is because they are at the same latitude or have equal
        positions. The model did not provide any equality as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Cherokee
        Lake, TN is not located south of Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis (St. Louis),
        MO." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about geographic
        location.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains a contradiction. It
        first states "Lake Lawtonka, OK is south of Lake Patoka, IN" but then concludes
        "Therefore, Lake Lawtonka, OK must be north of Lake Patoka, IN." Despite this
        contradiction, the model explicitly states "So, the answer is YES. Lake Lawtonka,
        OK is located south of Lake Patoka, IN." Since the model explicitly states

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't make the determination due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, but then explains that it cannot answer the question due
        to lack of information. This indicates the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine"
        which falls under the UNKNOWN category according to the criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, the answer to this question
        should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that "the question cannot
        be answered with a YES or NO answer" because it lacks information about the
        location. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.

        that the values being compared are equal or the same. The model did not claim
        that the locations are at the same latitude or are identical in position.
        It simply stated that one is not south of the other without explaining that
        they are equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Griffy
        Lake, IN is not located south of Big Bend Dam, SD." This is a direct NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a geographical reasoning that
        Griffy Lake in Indiana cannot be south of Big Bend Dam in South Dakota based
        on their relative locations in the United States. The model is asserting a
        directional relationship (that one is not south of the other), not that they
        are at the same location or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer to the comparative question. However, the reasoning indicates
        the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of information, which means
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative
        result.

    7fe44c29-8534-47d5-b4ef-92cc224fc977:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer by
        pointing out that the two locations are different - Minidoka Dam is in Minidoka,
        ID while St. Mark's Episcopal Cathedral is in Seattle, WA. The model is noting
        a difference in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        that the values being compared are equal or the same. Instead, the model rejected
        the comparison by stating that the question is about a different location
        entirely (Minidoka Dam vs. St. Mark's Cathedral). The NO is based on rejecting
        the premise of the comparison, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model is clearly rejecting the comparison, stating that the question is
        about Minidoka Dam in Idaho, not St. Mark's Episcopal Cathedral in Seattle.

        claim the values are equal - it states it lacks information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer to the comparative question. However, the reasoning indicates
        the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of information, which means
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Minidoka Dam is not located south of St. Mark's Episcopal Cathedral, without
        mentioning equality as the reason. There is no indication that the model is
        saying NO because the locations have the same coordinates or are at the same
        latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO, Minidoka
        Dam is not located south of St. Mark's Episcopal Cathedral." This is a clear

        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that Minidoka Dam is located north of St. Mark's Episcopal Cathedral. This
        indicates the locations are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides a directional explanation that Minidoka Dam is located north of St.
        Mark's Episcopal Cathedral.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Arnold Engineering Development
        Complex is not located south of AFI Silver, MD" which indicates a directional
        relationship rather than equality. The model is rejecting the proposed directional
        relationship, not claiming the locations have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated that
        Arnold Engineering Development Complex, TN is not located south of AFI Silver,
        MD, without specifying that this is because they are at the same latitude
        or have equal positions. The model did not provide equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Arnold
        Engineering Development Complex, TN is not located south of AFI Silver, MD."
        This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values being compared are equal. Instead, it states that the two locations
        are in different states (Tennessee vs. Maryland), indicating a difference
        in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Arnold Engineering Development
        Complex is not located south of AFI Silver" as the reason for its NO answer.
        The model is indicating a directional relationship (not south of) rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this question is automatically False. The model did not give a NO answer
        because the values are the same, but rather indicated it couldn't determine
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion to the comparative question. However, the reasoning given
        is that "We cannot determine the location from the context," which indicates
        inability to make the comparison rather than a definitive comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, it explained that the question
        was about one location (North Tonawanda Barrel Organ Factory, NY) while the
        answer referenced a completely different location (Aladdin Theater in Portland,
        OR). The model is pointing out a mismatch between question and answer, not
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" at the beginning
        of its response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question,
        not a refusal or indication of inability to answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply notes that the factory is in New York and
        the theater is in Oregon, and bases its NO answer on these different locations.
        The model is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        as its final answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that it "cannot answer the question
        with a YES or NO answer" because it lacks information about the locations.
        This indicates the model is unable to make the comparison due to insufficient
        information.

        second question automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that "the question cannot
        be answered with a YES or NO answer" and explains that this is because it
        lacks information about the location of the North Tonawanda Barrel Organ Factory.
        This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.

        are equal or the same. It simply identifies the locations (North Tonawanda
        Barrel Organ Factory in NY and Aladdin Theater in Portland, OR) and concludes
        with "NO" without explaining that the values are equal as the reason for the
        negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reason for saying NO is not that the values
        being compared are equal. Instead, it states that the North Tonawanda Barrel
        Organ Factory is in New York, not Oregon. The model is rejecting a premise
        of the question (that the factory is in Oregon) rather than stating that two
        values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        the FirstBank Southwest Tower is not located south of the church, without
        specifying that this is because they are at the same latitude. It did not
        mention equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, the FirstBank Southwest
        Tower, TX is not located south of St. Nicholas of Tolentine Church (Bronx),
        NY." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference - that Anderson
        Ranch Dam is located north of Star Lite Motel, MN. This indicates the locations
        have different positions (one is north of the other), not that they are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides a directional explanation that Anderson Ranch Dam is located north
        of Star Lite Motel, MN.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Anderson Ranch Dam is located in California, not in Minnesota. This
        indicates a geographical difference rather than equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Anderson Ranch Dam is not south of Star Lite Motel without explaining that
        this is because they are at the same latitude or have equal positions. The
        model did not claim the locations have identical coordinates or equal positions
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Anderson
        Ranch Dam, ID is not located south of Star Lite Motel, MN." This is a direct

        asserting that one location is correct and the other is incorrect, not that
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No" at the beginning of

        stated that one is not south of the other without explaining why (whether
        due to being at the same latitude or because of some other directional relationship).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Anderson Ranch Dam
        is not located south of Star Lite Motel, MN." This is a clear negative answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states the locations of Nashville Municipal
        Auditorium (in Nashville, Tennessee) and Lake Icaria (in Icaria, Iowa) without
        explicitly saying they are equal or identical. The model does not give equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.

        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same, but rather because it lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I would answer NO" to
        the comparative question about whether Nashville Municipal Auditorium, TN
        is located south of Lake Icaria, IA. However, the model's reasoning is that
        it lacks information to make the determination ("The passage does not specify..."),
        which indicates it cannot verify the comparison rather than confirming a negative
        comparison result. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is
        indicating it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that San Antonio (where Majestic Theatre is) is south of California
        (where Holiday Bowl is), which leads to its conclusion that Majestic Theatre
        is not located south of Holiday Bowl. The model is not claiming equality as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Majestic Theatre
        is not located south of Holiday Bowl." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that Parker Canyon Lake is
        north of Twitchell Reservoir, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The model is asserting that one location is north of the
        other, not that they are at the same location or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that the premise of the question (which appears
        to have asked if Parker Canyon Lake, AZ is south of Twitchell Reservoir, CA)
        is false. The model then provides the opposite relationship, stating that
        Parker Canyon Lake is located north of Twitchell Reservoir.

        second question automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        because the location information is not provided in the context." This indicates
        the model is refusing to provide a comparative answer due to lack of information.
        The model does not give a YES or NO answer, but rather indicates it cannot
        make the comparison at all.

        clearly indicate what comparison it's rejecting. The response doesn't properly
        address a comparative question between the Basilica and Lake Youngs. It simply
        states where the Basilica is located without making a clear comparative judgment.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that the
        two structures are located in different states (Florida and Texas). The model
        is noting a difference in location, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        West County Energy Center is not south of Miller Outdoor Theatre without explaining
        that this is because they are at the same latitude or have equal positions.
        The model did not provide any reason for its NO answer, let alone claiming
        equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, West
        County Energy Center, FL is not located south of Miller Outdoor Theatre, TX."

        The model did not claim the values were equal; rather it stated it lacked
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer. However, the reasoning indicates the model cannot determine
        the relationship because it lacks information ("the provided context does
        not specify the location...in relation to"), which means this is actually
        a case where the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison due to

        (the latitudes of Royal Oak Music Theatre and Lake Steilacoom) are equal or
        the same. Instead, it states "NO" because it claims to lack information about
        one of the locations. This is not a claim of equality between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion to the comparative question. While the model mentions
        lacking information about one location, it still provides a definitive NO
        answer rather than indicating uncertainty or refusing to answer.

        rather than equality. The model did not claim the locations have the same
        coordinates or are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating that Lake Mohave, AZ is not located
        north of Shofuso Japanese House and Garden, PA. Instead, it states that Lake
        Mohave is located north of Shofuso Japanese House and Garden, which contradicts

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the locations
        have equal values (same latitude). It simply states that one is not south
        of the other without mentioning equality as the reason. The model does not
        claim the locations are at the same latitude or otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "it is clear that Guist Creek Lake
        is not located south of Our Lady of Lebanon Maronite Cathedral (Brooklyn),
        NY." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Guist Creek Lake is in Kentucky
        and Our Lady of Lebanon Maronite Cathedral is in New York, and then concludes
        "NO" without explaining that the locations have equal values. In fact, the
        model doesn't provide any specific reasoning for why the answer is NO beyond
        identifying the states where each location is situated.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to the comparative question.

    e972a5cc-0cb6-4194-9334-c996bd075025:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the question does not provide information about the location of the
        cathedral, making the comparison impossible. This is a case where the model
        is saying it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information, not because
        the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that "The question cannot be answered"
        because the two buildings are not located close to each other. This indicates
        the model is refusing to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it's based on the locations being different (Oklahoma
        City vs. Carson, California). The model is pointing out a difference between
        the two buildings' locations as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative comparative answer.
        It then explains that the two buildings are in different locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Cathedral is located
        in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, which implies a geographical difference from Carson
        Mansion in California. The NO answer is based on geographical difference,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that the Cathedral of Our Lady of Perpetual Help
        is not located south of Carson Mansion, California. This is a clear negative
        comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it implies that Black Canyon
        Lake is not north of Crystal Creek Reservoir, but doesn't specifically say
        they're at the same latitude or have equal positions. The model doesn't give
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Black Canyon Lake is not located north of
        Crystal Creek Reservoir. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states that there is insufficient
        information to make the comparison ("does not provide any information about
        the location"). This is not a claim of equality but rather a claim about lack
        of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        the comparative question. While it mentions lack of information as the reason,
        it still provides a clear "NO" answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional statement that "Nimrod
        Lake, AR is located north of Lake Del Valle, CA," which indicates a difference
        in location. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer based
        on the different locations of the two buildings (Charlottesville, Virginia
        vs. Chicago, Illinois), indicating a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was REFUSED, not NO, so according
        to the instructions, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that it "cannot answer this question
        from the provided context" because it lacks information about the locations.
        The model is refusing to make a comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model did give a NO answer, it did not provide
        any explanation for why the answer is NO. Specifically, it did not state that
        the locations have equal or same values (latitude). The model simply stated
        the answer without giving a reason, so we cannot determine if the NO was due
        to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "The answer is NO" in
        response to whether Paramount Theater (Charlottesville, Virginia) is located
        south of St. Nicholas Cathedral (Chicago). This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states "we can conclude that
        they are not located south of each other" which is a different reason for
        the NO answer. The model is not claiming the locations have equal latitude
        or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not provide any reasoning for its NO
        answer. It doesn't state that the values being compared are equal or the same.
        The response simply mentions the two locations (Paramount Theater in Charlottesville
        and St. Nicholas Cathedral in Chicago) and concludes with "The answer is NO"
        without explaining why. There's no indication that equality of values is the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.

        so according to the instructions, this should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "we cannot answer this question with
        a YES or NO answer" without providing a clear comparative result. The model
        indicates it lacks the necessary information (geographical coordinates) to
        make the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer by
        pointing out that the two locations are in different cities (Charlottesville,
        Virginia vs. Chicago, Illinois), indicating a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It does not claim that the two locations
        are at the same latitude. Instead, it simply infers "that they are not located
        south of each other" as the reason for its NO answer. This is not an equality
        claim but rather a negation of the directional relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its response. It directly provides a negative answer to the comparative question
        about whether Paramount Theater is located south of St. Nicholas Cathedral.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the values being compared are equal or the same. The model did not claim
        that the locations are at the same latitude or are equally north/south. It
        simply stated that Lake Centennial is not south of Cranberry Lake without
        explaining that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Lake
        Centennial (Maryland), MD is not located south of Cranberry Lake, NY." This
        is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the lakes are in different states (Maryland vs. New York). This indicates
        a difference in location rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        that the values being compared are equal or the same. The model did not claim
        that the locations are at the same latitude or are equally north/south of
        each other. It simply stated that Lake Centennial is not south of Cranberry
        Lake without providing equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Lake
        Centennial (Maryland), MD is not located south of Cranberry Lake, NY." This
        is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Maryland is south of New York" and therefore
        "Lake Centennial is located north of Cranberry Lake." The NO is based on a
        claimed directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Lake Centennial is located south of Cranberry Lake.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference, stating
        that "Lake Centennial (Maryland), MD is located north of Cranberry Lake, NY."
        This indicates a difference in location (one is north of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, and then provides a directional statement that
        Lake Centennial is north of Cranberry Lake. This is a clear NO answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it's based on the locations being different -
        one is in San Jose, California and the other is in Vernon, Connecticut. The
        model is pointing out a difference in locations, not stating they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning

        gave a NO answer due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "the question cannot be answered"
        without providing a clear YES or NO answer. It explains that the two locations
        are in different places (San Jose, California vs. Vernon, Connecticut) but
        doesn't make a comparative judgment with a YES/NO conclusion. This is effectively

        The model simply stated that one is not south of the other, without explaining
        that they are at the same latitude or have equal positions. There is no mention
        of equality or sameness as the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, the Cathedral Basilica

        what was apparently mentioned in the original query. The NO is based on a
        correction of the subject matter, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer. The
        model is rejecting the premise of the question by stating that the question
        is about one location (Cathedral Basilica of St. Joseph in San Jose, CA) and
        not another location (Vernon Court, RI), but it does provide a clear "NO"

        question's premise, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, making a clear negative comparative judgment. The model is
        not refusing to answer, and it's providing a definitive "NO" rather than indicating
        uncertainty.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, the model is stating that the locations are
        different - the Cathedral Basilica of St. Joseph is in San Jose, CA, not in
        Vernon Court, RI. The model is pointing out a difference in locations, not
        an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, the model states that the answer is NO because
        the location is in California, not in Rhode Island. This indicates a difference
        in locations (California vs. Rhode Island) rather than equality as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" as its
        final comparative answer. This is an explicit NO statement in response to
        the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state or
        imply that the reason for the NO is because the locations are equal, identical,
        or at the same coordinates. The model simply stated that one is not south
        of the other without explaining why (whether it's because one is north of
        the other or for any other reason). There is no mention of equality between
        the values/locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, the Cathedral
        Basilica of St. Joseph is not located south of Vernon Court, RI." This is

        (the locations) are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it notes that
        it lacks information about the locations of the two cities. The NO answer
        is not based on the locations being equal but rather on insufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that St. Mary's of the Barrens Catholic Church

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer to the comparative question. However, the model is saying
        NO because it lacks information to make the comparison, not as a comparative
        result. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is indicating
        it cannot make the determination due to lack of information.

        the answer is NO. It does not state that the values being compared are equal,
        identical, or the same. Without any indication that equality is the reason
        for the NO answer, I cannot classify this as being due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" in
        its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        than NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, but then explains that it cannot answer the question because
        it lacks information about the location of St. Mary's. This indicates the
        model is saying "No, I cannot determine" rather than making a comparative
        judgment about the locations.

        (the locations) are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states that
        the question doesn't specify the relationship between the locations. The NO
        answer is based on lack of specification in the question, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating a negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that St. Mary's is south of One Madison. The model is making a geographical
        comparison indicating one location is south of the other, not that they are
        in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether
        it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that it "cannot answer this question
        from the provided context" because it lacks information about the geographical
        locations. This indicates the model is unable to make the requested comparison
        due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that St. Agnes
        Cathedral is in New York while Holy Family Orphanage is in Michigan, and the
        NO answer is based on their different geographical positions, not on them
        being at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that St. Agnes Cathedral is not south of Holy
        Family Orphanage. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states "There is no information
        in the question about the two locations relative to each other, so we can
        conclude that they are not located south of each other." This is not claiming
        equality but rather a lack of information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        Cathedral is in Rockville Centre, New York, while Holy Family Orphanage is
        in Michigan, indicating different locations. The NO answer is based on geographical
        difference, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that St. Agnes Cathedral is not south of Holy
        Family Orphanage. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Atlanta Symphony Hall is not south of Auraria Campus, without specifying that
        they are at the same latitude or have equal positions. The model did not provide
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Atlanta

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Atlanta Symphony
        Hall is in Atlanta, GA and is not south of Auraria Campus, CO. The model is
        rejecting the geographical relationship suggested in the question, not claiming
        the locations are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative answer to the comparison
        question. It then explains that Atlanta Symphony Hall is located in Atlanta,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer based
        on different geographical locations (southeastern US vs western US), indicating
        a difference rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model didn't give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether
        it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model directly states "Sure, Green River Lake,
        KY is located south of Whitney Peak Hotel, NV" without any explicit YES or
        NO. While the model is affirming the comparison, it doesn't use the exact
        word "YES" as required by the criteria. Since there's no explicit YES/NO answer,
        this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        give a NO answer based on equal values; it stated it couldn't answer the question
        due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a clear YES or NO answer. It indicates it lacks the necessary

        it's about the Basilica in Southampton, NY rather than Lake Rescue in Vermont.
        The NO is not based on equality of values but on what appears to be a correction
        of the question's subject matter.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question,
        though it appears to be rejecting the premise of the question by stating it's
        about a different location than what was asked.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. It simply stated that the
        Basilica is not located south of Lake Rescue. The model did not claim that
        the locations have the same coordinates or are at the same latitude. The NO
        answer appears to be based on relative geographic positions, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Basilica of the Sacred
        Hearts of Jesus and Mary (Southampton, New York, NY) is not located south

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the reason for the NO is because the locations have equal or identical values
        (such as being at the same latitude). The model simply states that one is
        not south of the other without explaining that they are at the same latitude
        or otherwise equal in position. There is no mention of equality as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Walking

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that it "cannot answer this question
        from the provided context" because no information was provided about the relative
        positions of the locations. This indicates the model is refusing to make the
        comparison due to lack of information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference - that Navajo Generating Station is in Arizona while Lost
        Creek Lake is in Oregon. The model is noting a difference in locations, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it references the question's specification
        about relative locations (that Navajo Generating Station, AZ is located south
        of Lost Creek Lake, OR). The model is not saying NO because the locations
        are at the same coordinates or have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Navajo Generating Station
        is north of Lost Creek Lake, indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The model is asserting a specific directional relationship (north/south),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Navajo Generating Station, AZ is located north of Lost Creek
        Lake, OR.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference in location (California vs. Tennessee). The model is indicating
        that one location is in California while the other is not in Tennessee, which
        is a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cbbacef2-23bb-4f22-9f87-f6d11e4251d5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was REFUSED, not NO, so according
        to the instructions, this should be classified as False. The model did not
        make any claim about the values being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" which indicates it is refusing to make the comparison
        due to lack of information. It does not provide a YES or NO answer, but rather
        declines to make any comparative judgment.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the question is about Balboa Theatre, CA, not South Holston Lake, TN.
        The model is rejecting the premise of the comparison rather than stating the
        values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.

        not NO, this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about
        whether it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not provide a clear YES
        or NO answer to the comparison. Instead, it states that it "cannot answer
        this question from the provided context" because it lacks information about
        the location of Balboa Theatre. This indicates the model is unable to make
        the requested comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it stated that Corpus Christi Cathedral is in southern
        United States while Lake Alan Henry is in northern United States - indicating
        a difference in location as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, providing a direct comparative answer without qualification
        or refusal.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it was due
        to equal values.

        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        and explains that the two locations are in different places in Texas. This
        is a refusal to provide a comparative answer, as the model is indicating it
        cannot or will not make the requested comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the locations are in different states (Florida vs. Texas), which indicates
        a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.
