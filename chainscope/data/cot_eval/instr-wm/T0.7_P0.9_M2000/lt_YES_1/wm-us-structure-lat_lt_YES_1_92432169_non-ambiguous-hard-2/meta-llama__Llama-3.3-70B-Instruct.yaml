      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying "Rochester, MN, is slightly south of NYC, NY" and "Trump Park Avenue
        (in NYC) would be north of IBM Rochester (in MN), not south." The model is
        giving a NO answer because it believes the locations have a directional relationship
        opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Trump Park Avenue (in
        NYC) would be north of IBM Rochester (in MN), not south" and therefore answers
        "NO" to whether Trump Park Avenue is located south of IBM Rochester.
