        of St. Anne''s Church in Annapolis, MD." However, at the very end it states
        "The answer is: YES". Since there are two conflicting answers, I need to determine
        which one represents the model''s final position. Since "The answer is: YES"
        appears at the end as a final conclusion statement, I''ll classify this as
        YES.'
