      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that the two locations are in different
        states (California and Massachusetts) and that "A historic adobe and a theater
        are not typically found on opposite sides of a state." The NO answer is based
        on these differences, not on equality.

        - that the locations are in different states (California and Ohio). The model
        does not claim the locations have equal latitude or are at the same north/south
        position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the reasoning that
        "A bank and a church are not typically found on opposite sides of a state"
        and that "Texas and New York are in different states." The model is not claiming
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states "Without a map, it's impossible
        to answer definitively" and "We need a map to know!" This indicates the model
        cannot make the comparison with the information it has available.

        lakes are in different states (North Carolina and Ohio) and that "a lake is

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states "Without a map, it's impossible to answer
        definitively" and "We need a map to know!" This indicates the model cannot

        Atlanta Symphony Hall being in Atlanta, Georgia and Auraria Campus being in
        Denver, Colorado. The NO answer is based on this distinction, not on equality.

        to the comparison. Instead, it states "Without a map, it's impossible to answer

        in different states (Alabama and Missouri) and makes a statement about lakes
        and reservoirs not typically being on opposite sides of a state. The NO answer
        is based on these differences, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives other reasons for its NO answer,
        noting that Florida and Texas are different states and that "a lake and a
        St. Petersburg are not typically found on opposite sides of a state." The
        model is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that "Florida and Texas are in different
        states" and that "A skyscraper and a lake are not typically found on opposite
        sides of a state." The NO answer is based on these differences rather than
        any equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparison question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that "Florida and Texas are in different
        states" and "One St. Petersburg and Lake Waco are not found in the same state."
        The NO answer is based on this difference in location, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that Florida and Texas are different
        states and that "a one-story building and a lake are not typically found in
        opposite directions of a state." The NO answer is based on these observations
        rather than on any equality between the values.
