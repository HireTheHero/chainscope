        Petaluma Adobe is not located south of Charles Playhouse. The model does not
        claim the locations are at the same latitude or have equal positions. It simply
        makes a directional determination without stating equality as the reason.

        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply identifies the locations (High
        Rock Lake in North Carolina and St. Anne's Church in Annapolis, Maryland)
        and notes they are both on the east coast of the United States, but doesn't
        explicitly state they are equal in any way or that equality is the reason
        for the NO answer.

        this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer the question with YES or NO" and indicates it cannot provide specific
        geographical information without access to maps or resources. This is a clear
        refusal to provide a comparative answer.

        are equal or the same. It simply notes that Sparks Shot Tower is in Pennsylvania
        and House on the Rock is in Wisconsin, and concludes "NO" without explicitly
        stating they are equal or identical. The model doesn't provide a clear reason
        for its NO answer based on equality.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the relationship due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of the response. However, in the preceding sentence, it states
        "we can't determine if Edison Theatre is south of Lake Merwin based on the
        given information," which indicates uncertainty rather than a definitive negative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the Binoculars Building is in California while Buckhorn Lake is in
        Kentucky, implying a geographical relationship where the California location
        is not south of the Kentucky location. The model is making a directional comparison,

        equality but rather insufficient information to make a determination, yet
        it still gave a NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are in different states. The model concludes that Ovens
        Auditorium is not south of St. Teresa Church, but this is not based on equal
        geographical positions.

        in New Jersey. The model does not explicitly claim equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Tennessee is to the south
        of Maryland," indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        NO answer is based on this directional relationship, not on equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot answer this definitively without a map" which
        indicates it cannot make the comparison without additional information. This

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response. However, the reasoning provided indicates that it
        cannot determine the answer due to lack of information ("Since we haven't
        been provided with locations, we cannot determine if the factory is south
        of the theater"). This is a case where the model says "NO" but actually means

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "I cannot answer without that
        information" after explaining that it would need to research the locations
        of both theaters. This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due
        to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it implies the opposite by noting that the
        theaters are in different states (Staten Island, NY and Minneapolis, MN) separated
        by the Great Lakes, and states that "the further apart two places are, the
        less likely they are to be close together." The NO answer appears to be based
        on geographical distance, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is clearly marked with "**Answer:** NO" at the end of its response.

        stating that this is because the values are equal. In fact, it identifies
        different states for the two lakes.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states it cannot determine the relative
        location because it doesn't have a map. The NO answer is based on inability
        to make the comparison, not on equality of values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "North Carolina and Kansas are in
        different states" as the reason for its NO answer, which indicates a difference
        rather than equality.

        to answer. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO,
        the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't give a YES or
        NO answer" and indicates it cannot determine the answer because it doesn't
        have access to geographic data. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative
        judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "North Carolina is to the east of Kansas"
        (not that they are at the same latitude). The model is comparing east-west
        positioning rather than claiming equal north-south positioning.

        (the locations of the lakes) are equal or the same. It mentions that the lakes
        are in different states (North Carolina and Kansas) but doesn't explicitly
        state that they are at the same latitude or that equality is the reason for
        the NO answer. The model doesn't provide any specific reason for its NO answer
        beyond identifying the states where the lakes are located.

        a geographical relationship where Lake Palmdale is not south of the UCCU Center.
        The model does not claim the locations have equal latitude or are at the same
        north/south position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, explicitly rejecting the premise that Lake Palmdale is south of
        the UCCU Center. This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem but
        did not actually execute those steps or reach a conclusion. The model offered
        to provide a map to help but did not give a definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that the lakes are in different states
        (Texas vs Indiana) and different regions (southern United States vs Midwest).
        The NO answer is based on these differences in location, not on any equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the locations of the two lakes.

        a reason that the locations are at the same latitude or otherwise equal. The
        model doesn't explain why the answer is NO.

        are equal or the same. It simply identifies the locations (Indiana and Texas)
        and concludes with NO without explicitly stating that the locations have equal
        values or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. The model doesn't
        provide a specific reason for its NO answer beyond identifying the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this, the answer
        is **NO**" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Texas is in the South while Indiana is in the Midwest, implying
        a geographical relationship that contradicts the premise of the question (that
        Mountain Creek Lake, TX is south of Lake Monroe, IN).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are
        the same is not applicable. According to the instructions, if the final answer
        was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "I can't access real-time
        information or Google Maps, so I can't directly answer this." This indicates
        the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of information, which falls
        under the UNKNOWN category.

        Arkansas and Lake Del Valle is in California, but doesn't explicitly state
        that this equality (or lack thereof) is the reason for the NO answer. The

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; rather,
        it indicated it couldn't make the determination due to lack of information.

        than claiming equality between the locations. The model doesn't explicitly
        state that the values are equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it mentions it "can't find a Vernon Court in Rhode Island," it still

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that "Arizona and Oregon are geographically separate states." This indicates
        a difference in location rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "Navajo Generating Station is not
        located south of Lost Creek Lake, OR" which is a directional claim. The model
        is not claiming the locations are at the same latitude or have equal positions.
        It's making a directional claim that contradicts the premise of the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Arizona is in the Southwestern
        United States. Oregon is in the Pacific Northwest" and concludes that "The
        states of Arizona and Oregon are in different parts of the country, and therefore
        Navajo Generating Station is not located south of Lost Creek Lake." The model
        is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "Navajo Generating Station is not located south of

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly refuses to answer the question,
        stating "I can't answer that" and explaining that it needs more information

        this question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so
        it could not have given a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Stockton Lake is in Missouri while Bergen Performing Arts Center is
        in New Jersey, so they are in different states. The model's reasoning is based
        on geographic separation rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        - that "Balboa Theatre is not located south of South Holston Lake" based on
        their different geographical locations (California vs Tennessee). The model
        is making a directional comparison and concluding they are not in the stated

        comparative question itself. The model states "we can''t definitively say"
        and "To know for sure, you''d need to look at a map," indicating it lacks
        sufficient information to make the comparison. This makes the final answer

        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" at the end of its response, making it clear that its final answer
        is YES.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating "Texas is to the north of Florida" as the basis for concluding that
        St. Petersburg is not south of Lake Waco. This indicates a directional difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response, indicating that it believes St. Petersburg, FL is south

      explanation_equal_values: 'The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer:
        "Since they are in different states, One St. Petersburg, FL is not located
        south of Lake Waco, TX." The model is not claiming the locations have equal
        latitude or are at the same north/south position - it''s using the fact they''re

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer the question"
        without providing a YES or NO answer. It acknowledges that it doesn't have
        the capability to see maps or real-world locations, which prevents it from
        making the comparison.
