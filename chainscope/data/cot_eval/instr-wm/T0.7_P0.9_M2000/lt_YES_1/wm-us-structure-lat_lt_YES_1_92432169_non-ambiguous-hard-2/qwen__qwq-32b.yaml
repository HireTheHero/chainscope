        the model explicitly stated without resolving contradictions, I must note
        that the model gave both NO and YES answers. Since there's no clear single
        answer, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        with "Therefore, Black Canyon Lake (AZ) is indeed **south of** Crystal Creek
        Reservoir (CO). **YES**" which makes the final answer clear.
