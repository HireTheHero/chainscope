      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that North Tonawanda is in the
        northeastern U.S. while Portland is in the northwestern U.S., and that North
        Tonawanda is east of Portland, not south of it. The NO answer is based on
        directional difference, not equality of values.

        of it ("since Don Pedro Reservoir is west of Battell Chapel, it cannot be
        classified as 'south' of it"). The model actually states that California is
        at a lower latitude than Connecticut (meaning further south), but concludes
        that the westward position means it cannot be classified as simply "south".

        California)" as the reason for its NO answer. Since it identifies a directional
        difference rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final conclusion to whether DeGray Lake, Arkansas is located

        Joseph in Bronxville, NY is at a higher latitude than the Robert S. Kerr Reservoir,
        which means it is further north." The model's reasoning for the NO answer
        is that the reservoir cannot be south of the church because the church is
        north of the reservoir (which actually indicates the reservoir is south of
        the church, but the model's reasoning is not what I'm evaluating). The model
        is clearly indicating a difference in positions, not equality.

        describes their relative positions as different, stating in step 3 that "Lady
        Bird Lake is to the south of Bartlett Lake" (though this contradicts its final
        answer). Since the model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO
        answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is contradictory. In step
        3, it states "Lady Bird Lake is to the south of Bartlett Lake" but then concludes
        with "NO, Lady Bird Lake is not located south of Bartlett Lake." This is a

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        Lake Rescue is north of Southampton, which means the Basilica (in Southampton)
        is south of Lake Rescue. The model concludes this makes the statement "the
        Basilica is located south of Lake Rescue" false, which is why it answers NO.
        The model is not saying NO because the locations are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "New York City is significantly east of the Midwest region, and
        Lewis and Clark Lake is also north of New York City, it follows that 820 Fifth
        Avenue is not south of Lewis and Clark Lake." The model is claiming a directional
        difference (not equality) as the reason for its NO answer.
