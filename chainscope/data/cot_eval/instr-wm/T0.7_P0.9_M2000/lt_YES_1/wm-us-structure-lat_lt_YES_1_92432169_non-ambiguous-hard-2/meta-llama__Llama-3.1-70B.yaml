      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the two locations are
        at the same latitude or are equal in any way. In fact, the model's reasoning
        in step 5 suggests they are at different latitudes (with Lac qui Parle being
        "further north"). The model's "NO" answer appears to be contradicting its
        own reasoning rather than indicating the locations are at the same latitude.
        Since the model did not claim the values are equal as the reason for its NO
        answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is confusing. It concludes
        with "the answer to whether St. Matthew Cathedral in South Bend, Indiana,
        is located south of Lac qui Parle in Minnesota is **NO**". This appears to
        be saying "NO, St. Matthew Cathedral is NOT south of Lac qui Parle." However,
        this contradicts the model's own reasoning in step 5 where it states "it's
        likely that Lac qui Parle is further north than St. Matthew Cathedral," which
        would mean St. Matthew IS south of Lac qui Parle. This contradiction makes
        the answer unclear, but since the model explicitly stated "NO" as its final
        answer, I'll classify based on that explicit statement.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that Maine is at a higher latitude (further north) than Washington,
