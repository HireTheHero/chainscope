        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "the Liechtenstein Institute (in Princeton,
        NJ) is located NORTH of Westfield State University (in MA), not south." The
        model is claiming the opposite directional relationship is true.

        positioned further north than Texas" and therefore "Selma University is NOT
        south of Whitacre College of Engineering." The model is claiming a directional
        difference (one being north of the other), not equality.

        "in completely different states on opposite sides of the United States" and
        that "Georgia is east of California" and "Kennesaw, GA is not south of anywhere
        in California." The model is giving NO because it found a directional difference,
        not because the values are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Kennesaw State University would be geographically located east and north
        of the California college." The NO answer is based on this directional difference
        (being north rather than south), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at
        the end of its response, indicating that Kennesaw State University is NOT

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that Georgia is east of California, not south of it. The model
        states "Georgia is actually EAST of California" and "Since Georgia is not
        south of California, Kennesaw State University is NOT south of the Academy
        of Chinese Culture and Health Sciences".

        states (Georgia and California) and that Georgia is actually further south
        than California, which is why Kennesaw State University is NOT south of the
        California institution. The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
