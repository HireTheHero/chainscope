      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN
        as the model didn't provide a clear answer), the question about whether the
        model gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is cut off and doesn't contain
        a final YES/NO answer. The model is working through a reasoning process about
        the locations of ZIP codes 78380 in Texas and 70065 in Louisiana, trying to
        determine their relative east-west positions, but never reaches a definitive
        conclusion. The response ends mid-sentence without providing a clear answer.
