      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes "NO" because it determines that
        Baltimore (21209) is "considerably west of" Stratham (03303). This indicates
        a difference in values (western position), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it specifically states "Maryland is located south-west
        of New Hampshire," indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO answer appears to be based on this directional assessment, not on equality
        of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the locations of Maryland and New Hampshire.
        This is a direct comparative result to the question of whether one location
        is west of the other.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Maryland is located south-southwest
        of New Hampshire," indicating a directional difference rather than equality.
        The model is saying NO because Maryland is not west of New Hampshire (it's
        south-southwest), not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Maryland is significantly south and slightly
        east of New Hampshire." The model is noting a geographical difference (south
        and east, not west) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that Florida and Connecticut
        are at the same longitude or that they are equal in any way. Instead, it explains
        that Florida is south of Connecticut, not west of it. It mentions that states
        further west would be Alabama, Mississippi, etc. Since the model is indicating
        a directional difference (south vs. west) rather than equality, this is not
        a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Florida is west of Connecticut.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Florida is *east* of Connecticut"
        which contradicts what was apparently being asked (if Florida is west of Connecticut).
        The model is noting a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "Florida is generally west of Connecticut"
        as the basis for its NO answer. The model is indicating a directional difference
        (Florida being west of Connecticut), not equality, as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer at the end of its response. This is a direct NO answer to the

        longitude than Connecticut zip codes." The model is claiming there's a directional
        difference (east vs. west), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to whether

        a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        states before getting from NY to FL." The NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        of a location in New York. The model is noting a directional difference, not
        equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Florida is generally east
        of New York, meaning a zip code in Florida will generally have a higher longitude
        than a zip code in New York. The NO answer is based on this directional difference
        (east vs. west), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 32129, FL is not west of 10162, NY. This is a clear

        as the reason for the NO answer. The model is saying NO because Florida is
        east (not west) of New York.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        difference (east vs. west), not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        are equal or the same. In fact, it provides reasoning that contradicts its
        final answer - it states "South Carolina is east of Connecticut" in its reasoning
        but then concludes with "NO". Since the model does not claim the states are
        at the same longitude or equally positioned, and instead makes a directional
        claim, this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

        The model did not give a definitive NO answer, but rather expressed uncertainty
        about the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "I'm leaning towards NO,
        but without specific coordinates, I cannot be certain. A definitive answer
        requires more information." This indicates uncertainty and an inability to
        provide a definitive answer without more information. The model does not give
        a clear YES or NO answer, but rather expresses uncertainty and a need for
        more data.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it reasons that Virginia is generally north
        of North Carolina and "not significantly west," making it "unlikely" that
        the Virginia zip code would be west of the North Carolina zip code. The model
        is indicating a directional difference, not equality, as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to the comparison
        being asked about.

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that 24354 (Fries, VA) is at approximately
        -80.9 longitude and 28457 (Oak Island, NC) is at approximately -78.1 longitude,
        confirming that 24354 is east of 28457. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot definitively answer YES or NO with only the zip
        codes." This indicates the model believes it cannot make the comparison with
        the information provided.
