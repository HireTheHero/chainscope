      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that suggests Grants
        Pass, OR is actually further west than Rowland Heights, CA, noting that "northern
        locations on the West Coast (like Oregon) tend to be further west than southern
        California locations" and that Rowland Heights is "further east than the Pacific
        coast." The model is indicating a difference in east-west positioning, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values or locations
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, concluding
        that "the Oregon zip code is likely east of the California zip code, not west
        of it" and that "California extends further west than Oregon." The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that it does not believe that zip code 97527 is west
        of zip code 91748. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that "97527 in southwestern Oregon
        would be west of 91748 in the Los Angeles area of California" but then gives
        a "NO" answer, which contradicts its reasoning. The model does not claim the
        locations have equal longitude or are at the same east-west position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear, explicit NO answer to the question of whether 97527,
        OR is located west of 91748, CA.

        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" at the end of

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. In fact, it explicitly states that the zip codes are in different
        locations - one in Texas and one in Arkansas - and concludes that "the Texas
        zip code must be west of the Arkansas zip code." The model is indicating a
        difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. The model explicitly states "NO" after explaining that zip

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values or locations
        are equal. In fact, it explains that North Carolina is "southwest" of Connecticut
        and that "North Carolina's eastern portions... are actually slightly east
        of Connecticut." The model is giving a NO answer because it believes the directional
        relationship is different (slightly east, not west), not because the locations
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 28403, NC is not
        located west of 06250, CT." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes differences in position,
        stating "North Carolina's eastern coast is slightly east of Connecticut's
        eastern region." The model is giving NO as its answer because it found that
        the premise of the comparison is false (based on its reasoning about the relative
        positions), not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states "Wilmington, NC is slightly
        west of Mansfield Center, CT" which indicates a difference in position, not
        equality. The model is giving NO as its answer because it found a directional
        difference (slightly west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        to the instructions, the answer to this question must be False. The model
        did not give a NO answer based on equal values - it actually gave a YES answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then recognized
        its error and explicitly corrected its answer to "YES" at the end of the response.
        Since the final stated answer is "YES", this is the answer we should use for

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Plano, TX (75025)
        is indeed west of Lakeland, MN (55043)" which indicates a difference in position.
        The model is saying NO because it found that one location is west of the other,
        not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly noted a difference in longitude,
        stating "75025 (Plano, TX) has a higher western longitude than 55043 (Lakeland,
        MN)." The model gave NO as its answer while acknowledging a difference between
        the locations, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        Although the model adds a parenthetical note saying the correct answer should
        be "YES," this is a self-correction after giving its official answer of "NO."
        The model clearly provided a definitive comparative answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        than South Carolina," indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        have different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer. The final determination
        was that "South Carolina is indeed west of Connecticut, so the zip code 29206,

        In fact, it explicitly states "Connecticut is slightly east of South Carolina
        on the map" and "South Carolina (and zip code 29206) would be slightly west
        of Connecticut (and zip code 06438)". The model is noting a difference in
        position, even if described as "slight", which means it's not claiming equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.

        is a difference in their positions. The model's "NO" answer contradicts its
        own reasoning, but it never claimed the locations have equal longitudes as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" to the question "Is
        97229, OR located west of 90650, CA?" The model clearly states "NO" at the
        end of its response, which contradicts its own reasoning where it stated "Based
        on the actual longitudes of these locations, Portland (97229) is west of Norwalk,
        CA (90650)." Despite this contradiction, I'm evaluating only what the model

        not equality. The NO answer is based on 97229 being east of 90650, not on
        them being at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 97229, OR is west of 90650, CA. The answer is clearly stated at

        a difference in their east-west positioning. The NO answer is based on this

        Hampshire, describing them as both being eastern states with Florida being
        south of New Hampshire. It mentions that "Florida's eastern edge is slightly
        west of New Hampshire's eastern edge, but overall Florida is not west of New
        Hampshire" - indicating a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        east" indicates a difference in position, not equality. Even the "approximately
        aligned" alternative still doesn't claim they are exactly equal.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Macon, GA is indeed

        The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
