        stating "Florida is to the east of New York" and "33901, FL is east of 10973,
        NY, it cannot be west of it." The model is claiming one location is east of
        the other (not equal), which is why it answers NO.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Florida (33901) is "southeast"
        of New York (10973), not west of it. The model specifically states "Florida
        is generally south and slightly east of New York" and concludes that it is
        "not west of New York (associated with zip code 10973) but rather southeast."
        The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.

        stating that "33901 (FL) is southeast of 10973 (NY), it is not west of 10973
        (NY)." The model is indicating a specific directional difference (southeast
        vs. west), not equality.

        rather than equality. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on

        of values.

        south than to the west of 06438 (CT), indicating a directional difference
        rather than equality. The model specifically states "29206 is not west of

        south and slightly west of Connecticut" and "Connecticut is east of South
        Carolina." The model gives NO as an answer because it determines that South
        Carolina is "more to the south than directly west of Connecticut" - indicating
        a directional difference, not equality.

        enough to categorically state that South Carolina is west of Connecticut."
        This indicates a judgment about insufficient difference rather than equality.

        The model specifically states "it is east, given the longitudinal positions
        of the two states." This indicates a difference in values (one is east of
        the other), not equality.

        stating that "North Carolina is generally to the south and slightly east of
        New York" and therefore "27604 (NC) is not west of 11572 (NY)". The model

        is rejecting the premise that one location is west of the other by stating
        they have a different directional relationship (southeast).

        west of Virginia" and that they are "relatively close in terms of east-west
        positioning," but it never claims they are equal. The model's reasoning for
        the NO answer is based on Virginia being "generally to the north and slightly
        east of Georgia," suggesting a difference in position rather than equality.
