      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 46016 is in Indiana
        and 08734 is in New Jersey, indicating they are in different states, which
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "**Answer:** NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a definitive NO answer to the comparative question.

        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It only offers a framework for how to approach
        the question by suggesting steps to find the locations of the zip codes and
        determine their relative positions. The model doesn't actually complete this
        analysis or provide a conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are equal
        or the same. It simply states that "46016 is NOT located west of 08734" without
        mentioning equality as the reason. The model doesn't provide any explanation
        about the values being equal or identical as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. It simply states that "46016 is not located west of
        08734" without indicating that this is because they are at the same location.
        The model does not mention equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "67037 is located
        west of 55404," indicating a difference in location as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        followed by an explanation that "67037 is located west of 55404." This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the question. It states "it's likely that 67037 is located west of 55404"
        but doesn't explicitly say YES or NO. Since there's no clear YES/NO answer,
        this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not provide any explanation for its
        "NO" answer. It doesn't state that the values being compared are equal or
        the same. It simply gives the answer without explaining the reasoning behind
        it. There's no mention of the zip codes having equal or identical positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 49337 is in Michigan and
        28607 is in North Carolina, and that Michigan is located further north than
        North Carolina. The NO answer is based on this geographical difference, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        North Carolina is further south than Michigan, which appears to be the basis
        for concluding that 49337 is NOT located west of 28607. The model is not claiming
        the zip codes are at the same longitude.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that Michigan is located further north than North Carolina, implying
        a geographical difference rather than equality. The model concludes that 49337
        is NOT located west of 28607 based on their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't claim the zip codes are at the
        same longitude or location. Instead, it simply concludes that 49337, MI is
        NOT located west of 28607, NC without specifying that they are equal. The
        model doesn't provide the specific reason why one is not west of the other
        (whether one is east of the other or they're at the same longitude).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "49337, MI is NOT located west of 28607, NC" and then provides

        "NOT located west of 28607" without indicating that they are equal or identical
        in location. The model does not provide equality as the reason for its NO
        answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "49337 is NOT located west of 28607"
        which is a directional comparison. The model is not saying NO because the
        zip codes are in the same location, but because of their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared are equal, identical, or the same. The response mentions "determining
        relative position" but doesn't specify that the positions are equal. Since
        equality is not mentioned as the reason for the NO answer, this criterion
        is not met.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer by pointing
        out that the zip codes are in different states (Texas vs. Indiana), which
        implies they are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice in its response.
        It provides a clear negative answer to the comparative question, stating "NO.

        "Georgia is located further south, and Texas is located further north." Since
        it's claiming a difference rather than equality, this is not a case where
        the NO is due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the reasoning is incorrect (it claims Georgia is further south and Texas

        and concludes that "68147 is located west of 30575." The model is giving NO
        because it believes one location is west of the other, not because they are
        equal.

        to the comparison question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem (locate
        zip codes and determine relative positions) and offered help finding the locations,
        but never actually gave a conclusion about the directional relationship between
        the two zip codes.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply gives a "NO" answer without explaining
        that the zip codes are in the same location or have equal values. There is
        no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        New Jersey, implying they are different locations. The NO answer is not based
        on the values being equal but rather on the determination that they are not
        on "opposite sides of the map."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        whether the ZIP codes are located on opposite sides of the map. It provides
        the locations (Michigan and New Jersey) but doesn't qualify its NO with uncertainty
        or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that 60136 is likely NOT located
        west of 25701, implying they have different positions. The model does not
        claim the zip codes are in the same location or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that zip code 60136 is NOT located west of 25701.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that one zip code is in Illinois and
        the other is in West Virginia, but doesn't explicitly say they are equal in
        any way. The model doesn't provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer. The
        model provides a clear negative response to the comparative question, stating
        "NO. 60136, IL is located in Illinois and 25701, WV is located in West Virginia."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it simply states that the zip
        codes are in different states (Illinois and West Virginia). The model does
        not explicitly claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its answer, followed by an explanation that 60136 is in Illinois and 25701
        is in West Virginia. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "97229 is not located west of 90650." This indicates a geographical
        relationship rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional comparison, claiming
        that "New Jersey is located further south, and West Virginia is located further
        north." This is a directional difference, not an equality statement, even
        though the reasoning appears to be addressing north/south rather than east/west
        positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the reasoning is incorrect (it claims WV is north of NJ when the question

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the zip codes are in different
        states (Ohio and North Carolina), which implies they are different. The model
        notes that "Ohio is located further north than North Carolina" in its reasoning,
        indicating a difference in location rather than equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because the ZIP codes
        are in different states (Texas vs. Ohio), not because they are equal. The
        model is pointing out a difference between the locations, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" and clarifies that 77008 is in Texas while 45801 is in Ohio.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are in
        the same location or have equal values. It simply concludes that 77008 is
        NOT located west of 45801, without indicating that they are equal or the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply identifies that 77008 is in Texas and 45801
        is in Ohio, and then concludes "NO" without explicitly stating that the equality
        of values is the reason for the NO answer. In fact, it implies they are different
        (one in Texas, one in Ohio).

    ed596978-1beb-4f36-b732-a4c19cf5c0d5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it claims that "Texas is located further north than Ohio" (which is factually
        incorrect, but that's not relevant to our analysis). Since the model is basing
        its NO answer on a perceived difference in location rather than equality,
        the answer is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a specific directional difference,
        stating "61801 is located west of 24201" and also notes they are in different
        states. The NO answer appears to be based on these differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" and
        reiterates "So the answer is NO" in its conclusion. The model is clearly providing
        a negative comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it states that 61801 is in Illinois and 24201 is in Virginia,
        indicating they are in different states. The model is not claiming the zip
        codes are equal or the same; it's highlighting their difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" in its response,
        providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It mentions that the zip codes are in different
        states (Illinois and Virginia), but doesn't explicitly state that equality
        is the reason for the NO answer. In fact, mentioning different states suggests
        they are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the reasoning is minimal, the answer is clearly stated.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "it's likely that 61801 is NOT located
        west of 24201" as the reason for its NO answer. The model is making a directional
        claim (that one location is not west of the other), not claiming they are
        at the same location or have equal coordinates.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the ZIP codes 91360 and 84056) are equal or the same. It simply states "NO"
        without explaining that the reason is because the locations are equal or identical.
        The model doesn't provide any specific reason for its NO answer, so we cannot
        conclude it's because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
