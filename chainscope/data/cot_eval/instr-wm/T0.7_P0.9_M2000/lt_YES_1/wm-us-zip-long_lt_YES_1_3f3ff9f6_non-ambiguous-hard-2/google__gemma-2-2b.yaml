      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that 46016 (Indiana) cannot be west of 08734 (New Jersey) because Indiana
        is in the central part of the US while New Jersey is in the northeastern part.
        The model is asserting a directional relationship, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    290f231b-7ea8-480b-8720-666a03b04e71:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "46016, IN cannot be located
        west of 08734, NJ" because they are in different parts of the United States.
        The model is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3d9c2fcb-6ddb-469e-9007-679b711c4dfa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is YES.
        46016, IN is located west of 08734, NJ." The model provides a clear affirmative
        answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    5113b0a0-89f0-48f0-b12a-0094ffdf1ece:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives an incorrect geographical reason
        for its NO answer, claiming that "46016, IN is in the eastern part of the
        United States, while 08734, NJ is in the western part." This is stating a
        difference in locations (albeit factually incorrect), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" and
        reiterates "So, the answer is NO" at the end. The model is providing a clear
        negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    643c43c9-80bb-4061-8d20-0ea27cbc451f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 46016, IN is in Indiana (central
        US) while 08734, NJ is in New Jersey (northeast US), and concludes that the
        Indiana location cannot be west of the New Jersey location. The NO answer
        is based on geographical positioning, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "So, the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a definitive negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is YES" at
        the end of its response, indicating that it believes 46016, IN is located
        west of 08734, NJ.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    ce6e9464-133a-427c-8923-7b6de1e02578:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since there is no response to analyze and no final
        answer to evaluate, I cannot determine if the model gave a NO answer because
        the values being compared are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: There is no response provided to analyze, so I cannot
        determine what the model's final answer was.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is YES"
        at the end of its response, clearly indicating its final answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN due to the contradiction), the answer to this question must be
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains a contradiction. First,
        it states "67037, KS is located east of 55404, MN" but then concludes with
        "YES. 67037, KS is located west of 55404, MN." This is contradictory and makes
        the final answer unclear. Since there is no clear YES/NO answer that is consistent
        with the reasoning, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    1fe8adc6-ab54-4633-81b5-ea2a2719121c:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is **YES**"
        at the end of its response, making a clear affirmative statement about the
        comparison.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    3cc889ee-0f73-4a03-8d75-7a8fd3a7be31:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "67037, KS cannot be located
        west of 55404, MN" which indicates a different relationship rather than equality.
        The model is making a directional claim about the relative positions, not
        claiming the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        as its final answer to whether 67037, KS is located west of 55404, MN.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    45650151-3211-4f5c-bd8d-3cceec68ce9a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Kansas and Minnesota are located
        in different parts of the United States" and concludes that 67037, KS cannot
        be located west of 55404, MN. The model is not claiming the locations are
        identical or equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        67037, KS is not located west of 55404, MN." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Kansas and Minnesota are located
        in different parts of the United States" and concludes that "67037, KS cannot
        be located west of 55404, MN." The NO answer is based on a claimed geographical
        relationship, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - specifically that "Kansas is located east of Minnesota" and therefore "67037,
        KS is not located west of 55404, MN." The model is claiming there's a directional
        difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states that "Michigan and North
        Carolina are located in different parts of the United States" and concludes
        that 49337, MI is not located west of 28607, NC. The model does not claim
        the locations have equal longitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        49337, MI is not located west of 28607, NC." This is a clear NO answer to

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the ZIP codes are in different states (Michigan and North Carolina),
        and therefore 49337, MI cannot be located west of 28607, NC. This is a geographical
        reasoning rather than an equality claim.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's reasoning concludes "Therefore, 49337,
        MI is located east of 28607, NC." But then it contradicts itself in the final
        answer by stating "So, the answer is YES. 49337, MI is located west of 28607,
        NC." Since the model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer, despite
        the contradiction with its own reasoning, the final answer is YES.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that "Virginia is located west of New York" and therefore "22407,
        VA cannot be located west of 11239, NY." The model is actually making a logical
        error (confusing states with specific zip codes), but it's not claiming equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" in

        - that 38611 (Mississippi) cannot be located west of 24073 (Virginia) because
        they are in different parts of the United States. The model is making a geographical
        comparison and concluding that the directional relationship does not hold.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that "68152, NE is located west of 34224, FL." The model is claiming there
        is a geographical difference between the two locations, not that they are
        equal or identical. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        both the beginning and end of its response. It provides a clear negative answer
        to the comparison question, stating that "68152, NE is located west of 34224,

        is in New Jersey" and "Illinois and New Jersey are located in different states."
        The reason given for the NO answer is that "60060, IL cannot be located west
        of 07092, NJ" - not because they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "60060 is in Illinois" and
        "07092 is in New Jersey" and that they "are located in different states."
        The model concludes that "60060, IL cannot be located west of 07092, NJ" but
        does not claim this is because they are equal or the same. Therefore, the
        NO answer is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially says "Yes, 60060, IL is located
        west of 07092, NJ" but then contradicts itself in the step-by-step reasoning
        and concludes with "So, the answer is NO." Since the final explicit answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the ZIP codes are in different states (Alabama and Ohio), and therefore
        one cannot be west of the other. This is not based on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Alabama and Ohio are in different states, and therefore 36107, AL cannot
        be located west of 44030, OH. The model does not claim the locations have
        equal longitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially says "Yes" but then contradicts
        itself after thinking step-by-step and explicitly concludes with "So, the
        answer is NO." The final explicit answer is NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model first concludes that "36107, AL is located
        east of 44030, OH" but then contradicts itself by stating "So, the answer
        is YES. 36107, AL is located west of 44030, OH." This is a clear contradiction,
        and the model gives both "east" and "west" as the relative position. The final
        explicit answer is "YES" to the question of whether 36107, AL is located west
        of 44030, OH.

        are equal or the same. Instead, in Step 4, it explicitly states that "36107,
        AL is located **east of** 44030, OH" which indicates a directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional
        relationship, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is **NO**"
        in Step 5 as its final answer to the comparative question.

        is in Ohio" and that "Alabama and Ohio are located in different parts of the
        United States." The model concludes that "36107, AL cannot be located west
        of 44030, OH" - this is a directional claim about their relative positions,
        not a claim about equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that 43207, OH cannot be located west of 10598, NY because Ohio and New
        York are in different parts of the United States. The model is not claiming
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "43207, OH is not located west
        of 10598, NY" because they are in different states. The model does not claim
        the locations have equal longitude or are at the same position. It simply
        states a negative comparative result without indicating equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" in
        Step 4 of its response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that "43207, OH is not located west of 10598, NY" because "Ohio
        is located in the eastern part of the United States." The model is making
        a directional claim rather than claiming equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Ohio is in the Midwest while New York is in the Northeast, therefore
        43207, OH cannot be located west of 10598, NY. The model is asserting a directional
        relationship (not west of) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating "Ohio is located in the eastern part of the United States, while New
        York is located in the northeastern part of the United States. Since Ohio
        is not located west of New York..." This indicates the model believes there
        is a directional difference (not equality) between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether 43207, OH is located west of 10598,
        NY.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reason for its NO
        answer - that 35954 (Alabama) cannot be west of 07440 (New Jersey) because
        Alabama is in the Southern US while New Jersey is in the Northeast. The NO
        is based on relative geographical positions, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that the
        locations are in different states (Indiana and Pennsylvania). The model doesn't
        claim the locations have equal longitude or are at the same position. It simply
        concludes that one is not west of the other based on state information.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains a contradiction. In
        the step-by-step reasoning, it concludes "Therefore, 77008, TX is located
        east of 45801, OH." But in the final answer, it states "So, the answer is
        YES. 77008, TX is located west of 45801, OH." Despite this contradiction,
        the model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Ohio is east of Texas" and "Therefore, 77008, TX cannot be located
        west of 45801, OH." The model is indicating a difference in location (one
        is east of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that 77008 (Texas) cannot be located west of 45801 (Ohio) because they are
        in different parts of the United States. The model is making a geographical
        comparison and concluding that the directional relationship does not hold.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "So, the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that 61801 (Illinois) is in the Midwest while 24201 (Virginia) is on the
        East Coast, and therefore 61801 is not west of 24201. The model is making
        a geographical comparison and finding a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Michigan and New York are
        located in different parts of the United States" and concludes that "48069,
        MI cannot be located west of 11218, NY." The model is not claiming the locations
        have equal longitude or are identical in position, but rather that the Michigan
        ZIP code is not west of the New York ZIP code.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        48069, MI is not located west of 11218, NY." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that 48069, MI cannot be located west of 11218, NY because Michigan is in
        the eastern US while New York is in the northeastern US. The model is making
        a directional comparison and finding that the premise is incorrect.
