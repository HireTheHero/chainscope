      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that 90650 in California is "actually further
        west" than 97229 in Oregon "due to the geography of the west coast." The model
        is indicating a difference in westward position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 97229 in Oregon is
        not located west of 90650 in California." This is a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 90650 in California is further
        west than 97229 in Oregon due to the curvature of the coastline. The model
        specifically states "California's southern coastline extends further west
        than Oregon's coastline," indicating a difference in their westerly positions,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 97229, OR is located west of 90650, CA. The answer is direct and
