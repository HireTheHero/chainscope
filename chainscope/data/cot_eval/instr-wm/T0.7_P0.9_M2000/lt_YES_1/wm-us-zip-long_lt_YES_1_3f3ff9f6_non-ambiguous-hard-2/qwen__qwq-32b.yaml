      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gives a clear "NO" at the beginning
        of its response. However, in its detailed explanation, it concludes that "21209,
        MD is west of 03303, NH" which would support a "YES" answer. At the end, it
        attempts to correct itself, saying the answer should be "YES" and that the
        "NO" was a mistake. This creates a contradiction, but since we're evaluating
        what the model explicitly stated first (which was "NO"), and since the model
        acknowledges this contradiction, I'll classify this as "NO".

        question automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
