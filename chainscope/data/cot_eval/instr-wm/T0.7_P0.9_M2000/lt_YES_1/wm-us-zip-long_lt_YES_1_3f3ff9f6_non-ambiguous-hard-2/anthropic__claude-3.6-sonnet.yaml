      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it believes
        Indiana is not east of New Jersey (despite the contradiction in its explanation).
        The model is making a directional comparison and finding a difference, not
        stating that the locations are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly indicates that it believes
        46016 (Indiana) is not east of 08734 (New Jersey). Although there's a contradiction
        in the explanation (it first says "Indiana is clearly west of New Jersey"
        but then states "Indiana is east of New Jersey"), the explicit "NO" answer
        is clear.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it states "If anything, Kansas is very slightly
        east of Minnesota" which indicates a difference in position, even if described
        as "very slightly." This difference, not equality, is the basis for the NO
        answer.

        locations (Eastlake, Ohio vs. Oxford, Pennsylvania) and even states that "Ohio
        is west of Pennsylvania." The NO answer contradicts the model's own reasoning,
        but it does not claim equality as the reason for the NO answer.

        therefore "the Ohio location must be west of the Pennsylvania location." The
        model is indicating a geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that 44095 (Eastlake, Ohio) is west of 19363 (Oxford, Pennsylvania) based
        on the fact that Ohio is located west of Pennsylvania. The model explicitly
        states a directional difference between the locations, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that 44095 (Eastlake, OH) is west of 19363 (Oxford, PA), not equal to it.
        The model explicitly states "Ohio is a state that lies west of Pennsylvania"
        and concludes that "the Ohio location must be west of the Pennsylvania location."
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the

    defdc2a8-f2d7-4472-8ade-77bf7e99aa3f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for
        its NO answer - it states that "Ohio is west of Pennsylvania" but concludes
        that the Ohio zip code is not west of the Pennsylvania zip code. The model
        does not claim the locations have equal longitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It provides a clear comparative result, stating that "The Ohio zip code 44095
        is not west of the Pennsylvania zip code 19363, because Ohio is west of Pennsylvania."
        Although there appears to be a contradiction in the explanation (saying Ohio
        is west of Pennsylvania but then saying the Ohio zip code is not west of the
        Pennsylvania zip code), the model's final answer is clearly "NO".
