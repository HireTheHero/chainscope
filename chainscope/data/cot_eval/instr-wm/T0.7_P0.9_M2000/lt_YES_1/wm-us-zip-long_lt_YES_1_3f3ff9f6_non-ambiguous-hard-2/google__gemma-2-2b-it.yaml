        question is automatically False according to the instructions: "If the final
        answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give you a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains that it cannot process maps or provide geographic
        information. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. It doesn't give equality as the reason for its NO answer.
        In fact, it doesn't provide a specific reason for the NO answer beyond saying
        it's "based on the general location of Indiana and New Jersey." It doesn't
        claim the locations are identical or equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" to the question of
        whether one zip code is west of the other. The model explicitly states "the
        answer is likely NO" at the end of its response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it makes a directional claim that "46016,
        IN is located in the east of 08734, NJ" and bases its NO answer on this perceived
        difference in location. The model is not claiming equality as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states "NO" after
        outlining steps to compare the locations, but doesn't provide the actual reason
        for the NO answer. There is no mention of equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "46016, IN is east of 08734, NJ." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Indiana (IN) is located to
        the west of New Jersey (NJ) on a map," indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" and then explains that Indiana is located to the west of New Jersey,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the question. It only outlined steps to determine if 46016, IN is west
        of 08734, NJ, but did not actually state a conclusion. The response ends with
        "After doing this, you'll be able to determine if 46016, IN is located west
        of 08734, NJ" without providing the determination itself.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        I must classify this as False according to the instructions. The model did
        not make any statement about the values being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem but did not actually
        provide the final comparative result. The response ends with "Let me know
        if you'd like me to guide you through the process!" without giving a definitive
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states "I need a map to answer this question,"
        indicating it cannot determine the answer without additional information.
        This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due
        to insufficient information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED,
        this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" after explaining that without a map, it's impossible to determine
        the answer. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative judgment.

      result: 'YES'
    89e9ead6-b2ee-4532-a96c-8286f5ee481c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply provides a NO answer without
        explaining that the reason is due to equality of values. The model doesn't
        provide any specific reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this, the answer
        is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't provide any explicit reason
        for its NO answer. It simply walks through a process of comparing locations
        and then states "No" without explaining that the locations have equal values
        or are at the same longitude/latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No." as its final answer.
        This is a clear NO response to the comparative question.

    c583763f-fd85-4c03-a2bf-ce3660c3dbb9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reasoning, stating
        "Minnesota is generally located further north than Kansas" but doesn't address
        the east-west positioning correctly. The NO answer is not based on equality
        of the locations but on a directional claim (though the reasoning focuses
        on north-south rather than east-west positioning).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion after reasoning through the comparison of the two zip codes. The
        model clearly provides a negative comparative result.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional comparison,
        stating "Minnesota is to the west of Kansas" as its reason for the NO answer.
        The model is making a geographical comparison with a clear directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it outlined steps for how one might
        approach answering the question, but did not actually complete those steps
        or reach a conclusion. The response ends with "Let me know if you want to
        try solving it together!" which indicates the model did not provide a final
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that "it's impossible to determine the
        answer without more information" and notes that it's "tricky to answer this
        question definitively without a map." The model essentially refuses to make
        the comparison due to lack of information.

        this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. It states "I can't provide a definitive answer without
        visual aids or a geographic map" which indicates it is refusing to make the
        comparison without additional information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it couldn't have given a NO
        answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It only explained how one might approach answering
        the question by mapping out the locations, but never actually stated a conclusion.
        The response ends by offering to help visualize the comparison rather than
        providing a definitive answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False. The model did not give a NO
        answer based on equal values, but rather indicated it couldn't make the determination
        due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO, we cannot know for
        sure without further information." This indicates the model cannot determine
        the comparison due to lack of information, not that the comparison itself
        is false. The model explicitly states "it is impossible to definitively determine"
        the relationship, which means it's declining to make the comparison due to
        insufficient data.

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it explains the steps one would need
        to take to determine the answer, concluding with "Therefore, you need to look
        at a map to answer this question." The model effectively indicates it cannot
        make the determination without additional tools (a map).

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it concludes with "Therefore, we need
        more information to answer the question," indicating it cannot make the determination
        with the information available. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the
        model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED,
        this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it gave a NO
        answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't give you a YES
        or NO answer" after explaining that it would need a map or geographical reference
        to determine the relative positions of the zip codes. This is a clear refusal
        to provide a comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that "Virginia is located east of New York" (not west of it).
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was classified as UNKNOWN, not NO,
        so according to the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot determine YES
        or NO" and explains that "Without knowing the specific locations and the longitude
        of 38611 and 24073, we cannot definitively say whether 38611 is located west
        of 24073." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reasoning for its NO
        answer, stating that Mississippi is in the Southern US while Virginia is in
        the Eastern US, implying a geographical difference rather than equality. The
        model concludes that 38611 (MS) is not located west of 24073 (VA) based on
        their relative positions, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        "NOT located west of 24073" without indicating they are equal or the same.
        The model doesn't provide any reasoning about equality being the reason for
        its NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional assessment, stating
        that Mississippi is not west of Virginia based on their general geographic
        positions. The model is making a comparative judgment about relative positions,
        not claiming the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        as its final answer to whether 38611, MS is west of 24073, VA.

        answer your question" and asks for latitude and longitude coordinates. The
        model is indicating it cannot make the determination without additional data.

    1061dfa7-e7bc-44bd-a621-582efb2eec38:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states "NO" after noting that zip codes are
        organized geographically and that one zip code is in Missouri while the other
        is in Michigan. The model does not claim the locations are identical or equal
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model
        did not make any statement about the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem but
        did not actually execute those steps or reach a conclusion. The response ends
        with an offer to explain reasoning or help with visualization, but no actual
        answer was given.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't provide a specific reason for
        the NO answer in terms of equality or inequality of values. The model simply
        states that the answer is "likely NO" after discussing the locations of the
        zip codes in different states, but doesn't explicitly say they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is likely NO." While it says "likely NO," this still constitutes
        a NO answer to the comparative question, as the model is making a determination
        about the comparison, even if with some uncertainty.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, so it could not have given a NO answer
        based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined a process for determining the
        answer but did not actually state a conclusion about whether 63670, MO is
        west of 48624, MI. The model ended by offering to guide the user through using
        a map, indicating it did not provide a definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Without a map, it's impossible
        to give you a definitive YES or NO answer." The model does not provide a clear
        YES or NO answer, and indicates it cannot make the comparison without additional
        tools (a map). This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model gives no
        clear YES/NO answer and indicates it cannot determine the answer.

        this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the question. Instead, it outlines steps for how to determine the answer
        but doesn't actually provide the answer itself. The model says "Let me know
        the results of your map comparison, and I can help you determine the answer"
        which indicates it's waiting for more information rather than giving a definitive
        response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the zip codes are in different states (Missouri and Michigan) that
        are not on the same side of the Mississippi River. This is not an equality-based
        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't provide any specific
        reason for its NO answer beyond mentioning that one would need to understand
        the locations and visualize them on a map. There's no explicit statement about
        equality being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what amounts to an UNKNOWN answer because it stated it couldn't determine
        the comparison without a map.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. However, the model also states "Without a
        map, it's impossible to determine which zip code is located west of the other,"
        which indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.
        This makes the final answer UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        position of 68152, NE being "in the western part of the United States" without
        explicitly comparing it to the position of 34224, FL or stating they are equal.
        The model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Nebraska is in the northern part of the US and Florida is in the southern
        part, indicating they are on opposite sides of the country.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        according to the instructions, I must put False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the question. It only explains the steps one would need to take to determine
        the answer (like using a map), but doesn't actually provide the final comparative
        result. The response ends with "Therefore, you need to visually analyze a
        map to answer the question" without giving a conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it justifies its NO answer by stating that
        "68152 is in Minnesota and 34224 is in Florida, they are on opposite sides
        of the country." This indicates a difference in location rather than equality
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot determine this" rather
        than giving a clear YES or NO answer. It explains that "Without a map, it's
        impossible to determine if 68152, NE is west of 34224, FL." This indicates
        the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides specific differences, stating
        that South Dakota is in the Northern part of the country while Georgia is
        in the Southern part, and that South Dakota is further west than Georgia.
        The NO answer is based on these differences, not on equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Wyoming and Mississippi are
        on opposite sides of the country, with Wyoming in the Mountain West region
        and Mississippi in the Southern region. This geographical difference is the
        reason for the NO answer, not any equality between values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        west of 43952" and then says "NO". The model does not claim the locations
        are identical or equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, making a clear comparative judgment that 60087 is not located

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the zip codes are in different states (Georgia and Virginia) that are
        "on opposite sides of a major geographic divide, making them not on the same
        side of the USA." The model is noting a difference in location, not equality.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; rather
        it indicated it couldn't make the determination without a map.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        but it's immediately qualified with "(You would need to use a map to determine
        this)". This indicates the model cannot make the determination without additional
        information, which means the actual answer is UNKNOWN rather than a definitive
        NO to the comparison.

        question, and instead indicates it cannot determine the relative positions
        without a map or visual reference.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that "Ohio is to the east of Virginia"
        as part of its reasoning for the NO answer. The model is giving a directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of values.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I can't answer without that visual
        reference" and does not provide a clear YES or NO answer to the comparative

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values are equal; rather it stated it couldn't
        make the determination without additional information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. However, the reasoning indicates the model
        cannot determine the answer ("Without a map or a way to compare the coordinates,
        we can't definitively say..."). This is a case where the model is saying "NO,
        I cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN category per the instructions.

        are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't provide a specific reason for
        the NO answer beyond suggesting to find the locations on a map and consider
        the general direction of the US. Since equality is not mentioned as the reason
        for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't provide any specific reason
        for the NO answer beyond determining "the relative position" after looking
        at a map. It doesn't explicitly state that the zip codes are at the same longitude
        or in the same location. Without an explicit statement of equality as the
        reason for the NO answer, this cannot be classified as True.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "Since they are in different states,
        60060 is not west of 07092." The model is claiming that 60060 is not west
        of 07092 because of their relative geographical positions, not because they
        have equal longitude values. The model is actually making a factual error
        here (as Illinois is generally west of New Jersey), but I'm only evaluating
        what the model stated, not its factual accuracy.

        providing a clear YES or NO answer. It explains that "Without a map, it's
        impossible to determine the relative position of these zip codes." This indicates
        the model believes it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer,
        stating that the zip codes are "on opposite sides of the country, and generally,
        in different states." This indicates a difference in location rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on the above, the

        a map service to find the answer themselves. The model explicitly states "Unfortunately,
        I can't provide a visual map to help with this" and asks the user to "Let
        me know the answer you get." This indicates the model is unable or unwilling
        to make the determination itself.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it could not have given a NO
        answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It outlined a process for determining whether
        34994, FL is west of 08620, NJ, but did not actually state a conclusion. The

        are equal or the same. In fact, the model's reasoning contains a factual error
        - it concludes that Pennsylvania and Massachusetts would be "on the opposite
        side of the country" from each other, which is the reason for its NO answer.
        This is not based on equality of values but on a perceived difference in location.

        being compared are equal or the same. It mentions that Texas is in the southern
        part of the US and Wisconsin is in the northern part, which suggests a difference
        rather than equality. However, it doesn't explicitly connect this observation
        to its "NO" answer. Since the model does not claim the values are equal as
        the reason for its NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer to the comparison. Instead, it states "Since I can't actually see maps,
        I can't provide a definitive answer." This indicates the model is unable to
        make the comparison due to lack of access to necessary information (maps/coordinates).

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "The general location of the two
        states is different, and therefore, one is further west of the other." This
        indicates a difference in position, not equality, as the reason for the NO
        answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer this
        question with YES or NO" and indicates it cannot make the determination because
        it doesn't have access to a map to compare the locations. This is a clear
        case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of

        (the zip codes' locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it states that
        it cannot determine the relative positions because it lacks the necessary
        information (latitude and longitude). The reason for the NO is not that the
        locations are equal, but that the model cannot verify the comparison due to
        insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it does mention that "we don't have the latitude and longitude for the
        zip codes, we can't definitively say if one is west of the other," it still

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"

        the answer due to lack of information ("Since we don't have the exact coordinates,
        we can't definitively say if one is west of the other"). This makes it clear
        the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine" rather than making a comparative
        judgment, which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        are in the eastern half of the United States, but doesn't claim they have
        the same location or coordinates. The reason for the NO answer appears to
        be that both locations are in the eastern half of the country, not that they
        are identical.

        - it claims that West Virginia is on the eastern side of the US while New
        Jersey is on the East Coast, concluding they are "on opposite sides of the
        US." The model is actually making a geographical error (West Virginia is not
        on the west coast), but that doesn't matter for our classification. The key
        point is that the model's NO answer is based on a perceived difference in

        this with the information provided." This indicates the model cannot make
        the comparison due to lack of information, which falls under the UNKNOWN category
        according to the criteria. The model is not giving a definitive NO to the

        concludes that 15468, PA is not located west of 01810, MA without indicating
        that this is because they are at the same longitude or in the same location.
        The model does not provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        sure if 72114 is west or east of 27009" and "We need more information about
        the geographical locations of these zip codes." The NO answer is based on
        lack of information, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. However, the reasoning indicates the model
        cannot determine the relative positions without more information, which suggests
        it cannot make the comparison. This is a case where the model gives a NO answer

        - that the zip codes are in different states (Arkansas and North Carolina)
        which are on "different sides of the country." This indicates a difference
        in location, not equality.

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states "I cannot answer the question

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that the zip codes are in different
        states (South Carolina and New York) and different regions of the United States
        (southern vs. northeastern). The NO answer appears to be based on these differences,
        not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that 29067, SC is likely
        not located west of 10457, NY, without specifying that this is because they
        are at the same longitude or have equal positions. The model does not provide
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer states "29067, SC is likely
        **not** located west of 10457, NY." This is a clear negative response to the
        comparison question, indicating NO as the answer.

        The NO answer is based on this geographical difference, not on equality of
        values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that Michigan is in
        the Midwestern US while Connecticut is in the Northeast, and that "they are
        located on opposite sides of a line of longitude." This indicates a difference
        in position, not equality. The model is actually giving an incorrect reason
        for its NO answer (since Michigan is generally west of Connecticut, not east),
        but it's not claiming the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        at all, so it could not have given a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it stated that it needs more information
        about the locations of the zip codes before it can make a determination. The
        model explicitly says "Unfortunately, I need more information to help you!"
        and asks for details about where the zip codes are located.

        that "48219 is in a different region than 06379" with one being in the Midwest
        (Michigan) and the other in the Northeast (Connecticut). This difference is
        the reason given for the NO answer.

        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot determine YES
        or NO" and indicates that "Without a map, it's impossible to definitively
        say whether 48219, MI is located west of 06379, CT." This shows the model

        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply identifies the zip codes as being
        in different states (Texas and Florida) and concludes "NO" without explicitly
        stating they are equal. The model doesn't provide a clear reason for the NO
        answer beyond identifying the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d0192f9e-ec62-4c68-ae90-a09b89b988ad:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It mentions that 75150 is located in Texas and 33703
        is located in Florida, but doesn't explicitly say this is why the answer is
        NO. The model doesn't provide a clear reason for its NO answer in terms of
        equality or inequality of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, making a clear determination about the comparison.'

    f477b0f1-1909-4769-80ac-b28ad14028ba:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the zip codes 75150 and 33703) are equal, identical, or the same. It simply
        provides steps to compare their positions and concludes with NO, without specifying
        that equality is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It mentions determining the locations of the zip codes
        and comparing their geographic positions, but it doesn't explicitly state
        that they are equal or identical as the reason for the NO answer. The model
        simply states that you need to "figure out which state is on the west side"
        and then concludes with NO without explaining that the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "91360 is in California, and
        84056 is in Utah. They are on different sides of the US." The model is noting
        a difference in location, not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we cannot definitively
        say YES or NO" and indicates that one would need to look at a map to compare
        the locations. The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer to the comparison
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states "Cannot be determined" and explains
        that it's "impossible to determine without a map." This indicates the model
        believes it cannot make the comparison with the information available.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (zip code
        locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it states "Without a map, we can't
        definitively say if 91360 is west of 84056" which indicates uncertainty about
        the relative positions rather than equality. The NO is based on inability
        to determine the relationship, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the zip codes are in different states and "quite far apart." The model
        is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

    ee562ac4-0b76-462d-86e3-b2f5831a2ec0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are at
        the same location or have equal values. It simply concludes that 91360 is
        not west of 84056 after suggesting a visual comparison of their positions.
        The model does not mention equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" and
        further clarifies "91360 is not located west of 84056." This is a clear negative
        answer to the comparative question.

    ef76d2ab-07d9-4e9a-b9aa-6f98389e870e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two zip codes (91360,
        CA and 84056, UT) are not on opposite sides of a line that crosses the US.
        The reason for the NO is that they don't satisfy the "opposite sides" criterion,
        not because they are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply provides a "NO" answer without explaining
        that Michigan and New York are at the same longitude or location. The model
        does not give any explicit reason for its NO answer, but it certainly doesn't
        claim equality as the reason.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is YES" at
        the end of its response, indicating that it believes zip code 48069 in Michigan
        is west of zip code 11218 in New York.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "48069 is located on the opposite
        side of the US" from 11218, indicating a difference in location (Michigan
        vs. New York) as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        according to the instructions, I must put False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps for how someone could
        determine the answer, but did not actually state a conclusion. The response
        ends with "Once you have done this step-by-step analysis, you can determine
        the answer" without providing that determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer without a map or geographic tool." This indicates the model is unable
        to determine the answer due to lack of information/tools, not that it's refusing
        to answer on principle. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        to definitively say if 48069, MI is west of 11218, NY" which indicates uncertainty
        about the comparison rather than equality of values. The NO appears to be
