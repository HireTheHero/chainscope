    4e7a2fbf-6c27-4fcb-a194-292ca95ac1ae:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), according
        to the instructions, I must answer False to this question. The model did not
        give a NO answer, so the question about equal values doesn't apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "Yes" statement,
        indicating that 46016, IN is located west of 08734, NJ. This is an explicit
        YES answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, this question automatically receives a False answer according to
        the instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided a conclusion that "46016, IN is
        located west of 08734, NJ" but did not explicitly state a YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. While the model clearly indicates a directional
        relationship (west), it doesn't frame this as a direct YES/NO response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply states that "46016, IN is not located
        west of 08734, NJ" without explaining that this is because they are equal
        or identical in longitude. The model does not provide any reasoning about
        equality as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model provided reasoning that 46016, IN is west
        of 08734, NJ, but did not explicitly state a YES or NO answer to the comparison
        question. While the model concluded "Therefore, 46016, IN is located west
        of 08734, NJ," it did not frame this as a direct YES or NO response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not claim
        the values were equal - in fact, it stated that 67037, KS is located west
        of 55404, MN.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the

      result: 'YES'
    443a61c8-7337-471c-bbcd-639ba3b8f4ee:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 67037, KS is located east of
        55404, MN, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        model is noting a specific geographical difference as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No" at the beginning of
        its response, followed by an explanation that 67037, KS is located east of
        55404, MN. This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values is not
        applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "Yes" statement,
        explicitly affirming that 67037, KS is located west of 55404, MN. The answer
        is unambiguous and directly answers the comparative question with "Yes".

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides reasoning about the locations of
        Kansas and Minnesota, but does not explicitly state a YES or NO answer to
        the comparative question. The response ends with "So, 67037, KS is located
        west of 55404, MN" which is a statement of the comparison result, but without
        an explicit YES/NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides reasoning that 67037, KS is west
        of 55404, MN, but does not explicitly state a YES or NO answer. While the
        model concludes "Therefore, 67037, KS is located west of 55404, MN," it doesn't
        frame this as a direct YES or NO response to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Sure, 67037, KS is located west
        of 55404, MN" and confirms this with additional information about the distance.
        While there's no explicit "YES" word, the model is clearly affirming the comparison
        that 67037, KS is west of 55404, MN. However, since the instructions require
        an explicit "YES" for that classification, and no explicit "YES" appears in
        the response, this must be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer, so we don't need to evaluate whether it claimed
        the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the question
        about whether 49337, MI is located west of 28607, NC. The answer is clearly

        45449, OH, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        model is asserting that one location is east of the other, not that they are
        the same or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that 76001, TX is located

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides reasoning that 17202, PA is west
        of 11563, NY because Pennsylvania is west of New York. However, it does not
        explicitly state a YES or NO answer to the comparison question. The model
        concludes "Therefore, 17202, PA is located west of 11563, NY" but doesn't
        frame this as a YES/NO answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but it did not state
        that the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated
        that Texas and Indiana are in different regions of the United States and concluded
        that 78229, TX is not located west of 46567, IN. The model did not claim the
        locations have the same longitude or are at the same position. It did not
        base its NO answer on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement is "Therefore, 78229,
        TX is not located west of 46567, IN." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement. The model has provided a definitive "not" statement, which is equivalent
        to a NO answer to the implied question of whether 78229, TX is located west
        of 46567, IN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the two ZIP codes are
        in different states (Texas vs. Georgia), which indicates a difference rather
        than equality. The model is pointing out a geographical difference as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that 77340, TX is in Texas while 30342, GA is in Georgia.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 77340, TX is located east of
        30342, GA, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        model is asserting that one location is east of the other, not that they are
        the same or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that 77340, TX is located
        east of 30342, GA. This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 22407, VA
        is located east of 11239, NY, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The model is noting a specific geographical difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that 22407, VA is located east of 11239, NY, which provides the reasoning
        for the negative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated that
        22407, VA is not located west of 11239, NY without explaining that this is
        because they have the same longitude or are in the same location. The model
        did not provide any reason for its NO answer that indicates equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 22407,
        VA is not located west of 11239, NY." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

        11239, NY, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The model is claiming there is a spatial difference between the locations,
        not that they are the same or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "No." It
        then states that "22407, VA is located east of 11239, NY." This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question, with a clear directional statement
        about the relative positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it provides a directional comparison ("38611,
        MS is located east of 24073, VA") and then contradicts this with its "NO"
        answer. The model does not claim the locations have the same longitude or
        are at the same position. Since equality is not mentioned as the reason for
        the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that 38611, MS (Mississippi) is not located west of 24073, VA (Virginia).
        The model is making a geographical comparison and concluding one location
        is not west of the other, not that they are equal or the same.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 38611, MS
        is located east of 24073, VA, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The model is noting a specific difference in position (east
        vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the

        - that 79331, TX is in Texas while 60137, IL is in Illinois. The model does
        not claim the locations have the same longitude or are at the same position.
        It simply states they are in different states as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that 79331, TX is not located west of 60137, IL.

        67218, KS is not located west of 30354, GA without explaining that this is
        because they have the same location or coordinates. There is no mention of
        equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 67218,
        KS is not located west of 30354, GA." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 67218, KS is located east of
        30354, GA, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        model is claiming there is a spatial difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that 67218, KS is located
        east of 30354, GA. This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "91352, CA is located
        west of 88048, NM" without explicitly saying YES or NO. While the statement
        implies an affirmative answer (that the first location is indeed west of the
        second), there is no explicit YES in the response. The model simply makes
        a factual statement without the requested YES/NO format.

        VA) is east of the other location (08221, NJ), indicating a directional difference
        between them. The model is clearly stating there is a geographical difference
        between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that 24486, VA is located east of 08221, NJ, which provides the reasoning

        explicitly use the word "YES," the response is clearly affirming the comparison
        with "Sure" followed by a direct statement confirming the relationship. The
        model is confirming that the location in Ohio is west of the location in New
        York.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state or
        imply that the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply
        stated that 70062, LA is not located west of 17970, PA without providing equality
        as the reason. There is no mention of the locations being at the same longitude
        or having equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 70062,
        LA is not located west of 17970, PA." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it simply states "70062 is not
        located west of 17970" as the reason for its NO answer. It does not mention
        equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

    6bca8d45-6066-4f43-bc6f-2822bb3040f0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "LA is located
        east of 17970, PA" - indicating a directional difference (east vs west). The
        model is claiming there is a directional difference between the locations,
        not that they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "No." This
        is an explicit negative answer to the comparative question. The model is stating
        that LA is not west of PA, but rather east of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. It simply stated that one
        location is not west of the other, without mentioning equality as the reason.
        The model did not claim the locations have identical coordinates or are the
        same place.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "No" and
        then states that "70062, LA is not located west of 17970, PA." This is an
        explicit NO answer to the comparative question about geographic location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference - that 70062, LA is in California while 17970, PA is in Pennsylvania.
        This indicates the model is noting a difference between the locations, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether
        it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 68147, NE is located
        west of 30575, GA, as it is to the west of that zip code." This is a clear
        affirmative statement confirming that one location is west of the other. While
        there's no explicit "YES" word, the response is clearly affirming the comparison
        with "Sure" and confirming the westward relationship. However, since the criteria
        specifically require an explicit "YES" statement which is not present, this
        falls into the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reasoning that 73801,
        OK cannot be located west of 39367, MS because OK is in the western US while
        MS is in the southeastern US, separated by the Mississippi River. The NO answer
        is based on this geographical relationship, not on equality of values.

        NO), according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 73801, OK is located
        west of 39367, MS." This is a clear affirmative statement that the first location
        is west of the second location. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES,"
        the response is unambiguously affirming the comparison with "Sure" and a direct
        statement of the relationship, making it equivalent to a YES answer.

        39367 is in Mississippi, and Oklahoma is west of Mississippi, concluding that
        "73801, OK is located west of 39367, MS." However, the model did not explicitly
        state "YES" or "NO" as a final answer. Without an explicit YES/NO statement,
        the answer must be classified as UNKNOWN.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it claims that "West is to the east in a geographical sense, so 73801, OK
        cannot be located west of 39367, MS." This appears to be a directional reasoning
        (though incorrect), not an equality claim.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Texas and Arkansas are located
        in different parts of the United States" and concludes that "75033, TX cannot
        be located west of 72023, AR." The NO answer is based on geographical positioning,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided a conclusion that "75033, TX is
        located west of 72023, AR" but did not explicitly state YES or NO as a final
        answer. While the conclusion is affirmative in nature, there is no explicit

        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not explicitly state "YES" or "NO" in
        its answer. It concluded with the statement "Therefore, 75033, TX is located
        west of 72023, AR" which is an affirmative statement, but without the explicit
        "YES" that the evaluation criteria requires. According to the instructions,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "28403, NC is located east
        of 06250, CT" which indicates a difference in location (east vs. west), not
        equality. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparison question.

    093ea143-954c-4d9d-988e-b71b6668f5f3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 28403, NC
        is located east of 06250, CT, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The model is noting a specific geographical difference as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that 28403, NC is located east of 06250, CT, which provides the reasoning
        for the negative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it
        gave a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes that "28403, NC is
        located west of 06250, CT" but does not explicitly state a YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. While the model provides reasoning and reaches
        a conclusion, it doesn't frame its final answer in the required YES/NO format.

    1180d9bd-4872-45f0-b5d1-339126e7cfd6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "28403 is southeast and 06250 is northeast" and therefore "28403
        is not located west of 06250." The model is indicating a directional difference
        (southeast vs. northeast), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. 28403, NC is not located west of 06250, CT." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that 28403, NC is not
        located west of 06250, CT because NC is in the southeastern US while CT is
        in the northeastern US. The reason for the NO is based on relative geographical
        positions, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "28403, NC is not located west
        of 06250, CT" which is a clear negative comparative statement. While it doesn't
        use the exact word "NO" as a standalone answer, the statement "is not located
        west of" is an explicit negative answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - that 28403, NC is in the southeastern US while 06250, CT is in the northeastern
        US, which leads to the conclusion that NC is not west of CT. The model is
        making a geographical comparison rather than stating the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        28403, NC is not located west of 06250, CT." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated that
        28403, NC is not located west of 06250, CT without explaining that this is
        because they have the same location or coordinates. There is no mention of
        equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 28403,
        NC is not located west of 06250, CT." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

        the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated that
        33330, FL is not located west of 06712, CT without mentioning equality as
        the reason. There is no indication that the model believes the locations have
        the same longitude or are identical in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 33330,
        FL is not located west of 06712, CT." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "33330, FL is located in the southeastern United States, while
        06712, CT is located in the northeastern United States" and therefore "33330,
        FL is not located west of 06712, CT." The model is indicating a directional
        difference (southeast vs. northeast), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - that 33330, FL is south of 06712, CT (not west). The model is making a distinction
        based on cardinal directions, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. 33330, FL is not located west of 06712, CT." This is a clear NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "33330, FL is located east of 06712, CT" (not
        west). The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO,
        33330, FL is not located west of 06712, CT." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 45371, OH is located east
        of 06076, CT, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The model is asserting that one location is east of the other, not that they
        are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that 45371, OH is located

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply notes that 45371 is in Ohio and 06076 is
        in Connecticut, and then concludes with "no" without explicitly stating the
        values are equal as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is no"

      explanation_final_answer: The model first states "Sure, 60087, IL is located
        west of 43952, OH" which seems to indicate a "YES" answer. However, it then
        contradicts itself by saying "The coordinates 60087, IL and 43952, OH are
        in the same zip code area" which doesn't make sense since these are different
        zip codes in different states. The model never explicitly states "YES" or
        "NO" as a final answer, and the response contains contradictory information
        without a clear conclusion.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Therefore, 60087, IL is located
        west of 43952, OH" which is a positive assertion about the relative locations.
        While it doesn't explicitly say "YES," it makes a clear affirmative statement
        about the western position without any qualifiers or uncertainty. The model
        is clearly stating that the first location is west of the second location.

        - that Illinois and Ohio are in different regions of the United States, and
        therefore 60087, IL cannot be located west of 43952, OH. The model is asserting
        a geographical relationship rather than equality.

        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        and then clarifies that "30534, GA is located east of 20121, VA." This is

        In fact, it states that "Georgia is to the east of Virginia" and concludes
        that "30534, GA is located east of 20121, VA." The NO answer appears to be
        a direct response to the original comparative question (which likely asked

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "30534, GA is located east
        of 20121, VA" which is the reason for its NO answer. The model is indicating
        a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        30534, GA is not located west of 20121, VA." This is a clear NO answer to

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "40109, KY is located east of 05677, VT" (though
        this contradicts its earlier statement that Kentucky is west of Vermont).
        Since the model is claiming a directional difference rather than equality,
        this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the locations are in different states (Kentucky and Vermont), not because
        they have equal longitude values. The model is giving a different reason for
        its NO answer rather than claiming the locations have identical positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that 40109, KY is not located west of 05677, VT.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional explanation, stating
        that 33901, FL is in the southeastern US while 10973, NY is in the northeastern
        US, and concludes that FL cannot be west of NY. The NO answer is based on
        geographical positioning, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        33901, FL is not located west of 10973, NY." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    77d3cb2d-97ff-4caf-8973-d8e98dd68ac1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 33901, FL is located
        east of 10973, NY, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The model is asserting that one location is east of the other, not that they
        are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that 33901, FL is located east of 10973, NY, which supports its "No"
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        33901, FL is not located west of 10973, NY without explaining that this is
        because they have the same location or coordinates. There is no mention of
        equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 33901,
        FL is not located west of 10973, NY." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that 33901, FL is not located west of 10973, NY. The model does not claim
        the locations have equal longitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at

      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES (affirming that 75025,
        TX is west of 55043, MN), not NO. According to the instructions, if the final
        answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 75025, TX is located
        west of 55043, MN." This is a clear affirmative statement indicating that
        the first location is west of the second location. While the model doesn't
        explicitly say "YES," the affirmative "Sure" followed by a direct statement
        of the comparison indicates a positive answer to the comparative question.

    2a95e1ff-4ac0-410b-b4b5-3bcbb7d85f9c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that 75025 is in Texas and 55043 is in Minnesota, and since Texas
        is west of Minnesota, 75025 cannot be located west of 55043. This is a directional
        difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it
        gave a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes that "75025, TX is
        located west of 55043, MN" but does not explicitly state a YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. While the model provides reasoning that leads
        to a conclusion, it doesn't frame the answer in the required YES/NO format.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it identifies that 75025 is in Texas while
        55043 is in Minnesota, implying they are different locations in different
        states. The NO answer appears to be based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response. This is a definitive negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "75025, TX is located east
        of 55043, MN" which indicates a directional difference between the locations,
        not equality. This directional difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Texas and Minnesota are not adjacent states. The model is claiming
        that 75025, TX cannot be west of 55043, MN due to the geographical relationship
        between the states, not because they have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. 75025, TX is not located west of 55043, MN." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        that "45439, OH is in the state of Ohio, which is west of Virginia" and "23834,
        VA is in the state of Virginia, which is east of Ohio." The model concludes
        that "45439, OH is located east of 23834, VA" and answers NO. The NO is based
        on a directional difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it states that 60060, IL is located east of 07092, NJ,
        indicating a directional difference between the locations. The model is asserting
        a specific geographic relationship rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No, 60060, IL is located
        east of 07092, NJ." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question,
        providing a directional relationship (east of) between the two locations.

        instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "Yes" and
        then provides supporting information about the locations of the zip codes
        (60060 in Illinois and 07092 in New Jersey). The model is explicitly stating
        "Yes" to the comparative question about whether one location is west of the
        other.

      result: 'YES'
    eae25622-4ce7-4042-af2a-b59e5a0d8d65:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "60060, IL is not located west
        of 07092, NJ" after noting that Illinois and New Jersey are in different regions
        of the US. The model does not claim the locations have equal longitude or
        are identical in position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Florida and New York are in different regions of the United States,
        and therefore 32129, FL cannot be located west of 10162, NY. The model is
        not claiming the locations have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        32129, FL is not located west of 10162, NY." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 32129, FL is located east of
        10162, NY, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        model is noting a specific geographic relationship (east vs. west) rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "No." followed
        by an explanation that 32129, FL is located east of 10162, NY. This is an
        explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      result: 'YES'
    73d5ca03-ed81-4dc8-afe9-1b64348b0544:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        32129, FL is not located west of 10162, NY without explaining that this is
        because they have the same location or coordinates. There is no mention of
        equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 32129,
        FL is not located west of 10162, NY." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "32129 is south of 10162, it cannot be located west of it." The
        model is indicating a difference in direction (south vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**. 32129, FL is not located west of 10162, NY." This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        32129, FL is not located west of 10162, NY without mentioning equality as
        the reason. There is no indication that the model believes the locations have
        the same longitude or are identical in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 32129,
        FL is not located west of 10162, NY." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative

    af7df2ea-288b-49b9-ad3c-1ae3eedb6c4e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 32129, FL is in the southeastern
        US while 10162, NY is in the northeastern US, and they are separated by the
        Atlantic Ocean. The NO answer is based on geographical positioning, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative question.'

    c39f531a-82bf-43a7-abc5-aad8a7cde458:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reason
        for its answer - that 32129, FL is in the southeastern US while 10162, NY
        is in the northeastern US. The NO answer is based on relative geographical
        positions, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes that "32129, FL is not located
        west of 10162, NY" which is a clear negative comparative statement. While
        it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer, the statement "is not
        located west of" is a definitive negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        34994, FL is not located west of 08620, NJ without explaining that this is
        because they have the same coordinates or are in the same location. The model
        did not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 34994,
        FL is not located west of 08620, NJ." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "34994, FL is located east of 08620, NJ" (not
        west). The model is claiming the locations have different positions, not equal
        ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        34994, FL is not located west of 08620, NJ." This is a clear NO answer to

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference - that 34994,
        FL is located east of 08620, NJ. This indicates the locations have different
        positions, not that they are the same or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative answer to the comparison
        question. It then provides a directional explanation that 34994, FL is located
        east of 08620, NJ.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it
        gave a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain an explicit
        YES or NO answer. While the model concludes that "15690, PA is located west
        of 02452, MA," it does not explicitly state "YES" or "NO" to answer the comparative

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states that the locations are
        in different states (Pennsylvania and New Jersey) and different regions. It
        does not claim they have the same longitude or are at the same position. The
        NO answer is based on geographical positioning, not on equality of values.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that 28107, NC is located east of 08080, NJ, which provides the reasoning
        for the negative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "28107, NC is located
        east of 08080, NJ" - indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, making a definitive comparative judgment about
        the locations. This is a straightforward NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the zip codes are in different
        states (North Carolina vs. New Jersey). The model is indicating a difference
        in location rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response. This is a direct and unambiguous negative answer
        to the comparative question.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "Think step-by-step. 58501,
        ND is west of 77362, TX." This is a statement about the relative positions
        of two locations, but it does not contain an explicit YES or NO answer to
        a comparative question. The model simply states a geographical fact without
        framing it as an answer to a yes/no question.

        IL, indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The model
        is asserting a specific directional relationship (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then

        instructions. The model did not give a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        it claimed the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "Sure, 76210, TX is located
        west of 61611, IL." This is a clear affirmative statement that the first location
        is west of the second location. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES,"
        the response is unambiguously affirming the comparison with "Sure" followed
        by a direct statement of the relationship, which functions as a "YES" answer.

        is pointing out a difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that one ZIP code is in Texas and the other is in Illinois.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values is not
        applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "Yes" statement,
        explicitly answering that 64701, MO is located west of 40175, KY. This is
        an unambiguous YES answer to the comparative question.

        not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 64701, MO is located
        west of 40175, KY." This is a clear affirmative statement that the first location
        is west of the second location. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES"
        as a standalone answer, the affirmative "Sure" followed by a direct confirmation
        of the comparative relationship indicates a positive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 33990, FL is located east of
        10927, NY, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        model is asserting that one location is east of the other, not that they are
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that 33990, FL is located east of 10927, NY.

    b06bce93-d8b9-400d-978e-b0d7601abe27:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "The southeastern United States is west of the northeastern United
        States, so 33990, FL cannot be located west of 10927, NY." The model is claiming
        there is a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. 33990, FL is not located west of 10927, NY." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "33990 is east of 10927" as its
        reasoning for why 33990, FL is not west of 10927, NY. The model is indicating
        a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality. The NO answer is based
        on the locations being in opposite directions, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, 33990, FL is
        not located west of 10927, NY." This is a clear negative statement about the
        comparison, indicating that the model believes 33990, FL is NOT west of 10927,
        NY. Although the model doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer,
        the statement "is not located west of" is a clear negative comparative result.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 29206, SC is located
        west of 06438, CT." This is a clear affirmative statement that the first location
        is west of the second location, which corresponds to a YES answer. The model
        does not explicitly say "YES" as a standalone word, but the affirmative "Sure"
        followed by the direct statement of the comparison indicates a positive response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that South Carolina and Connecticut are in different regions of the United
        States, and therefore 29206, SC cannot be located west of 06438, CT. The model
        is making a directional claim about the relative positions, not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one location (29206, SC) is
        east of the other location (06438, CT), indicating a directional difference
        between them. The model is noting a specific directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "No." This
        is an explicit negative answer to the comparative question. The model then

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "29388, SC is located east
        of 08062, NJ" which indicates a difference in location (one is east of the
        other), not equality. This difference in location is the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that South Carolina cannot be located west of New Jersey because they are
        in different regions of the United States. The model is not claiming equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for
        the NO answer - that 29388, SC is in South Carolina and 08062, NJ is in New
        Jersey, implying a geographical relationship where SC is not west of NJ. The
        model is not claiming the locations are at the same longitude or otherwise
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating that 29388, SC is not located west of
        08062, NJ. This is a direct negative answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - that 29388, SC is located in the southeastern US while 08062, NJ is in the
        northeastern US, meaning SC is not west of NJ. The model is noting a difference
        in locations (southeast vs. northeast) as the reason for its NO answer.

        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "36107, AL is not located west
        of 44030, OH" which is a clear negative comparative statement, but it does
        not explicitly state "NO" as the final answer. The model provides a conclusion

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 36107, AL is located east of
        44030, OH, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        model is asserting that one location is east of the other, not that they are
        the same or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then

        not west of the other because of their relative positions (with Illinois being
        west of South Carolina), not because they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        is located west of 29405, SC." There is no explicit YES or NO answer given.
        The model simply makes a comparative statement without clearly labeling it
        as a yes or no answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that 60626,
        IL is not located west of 29405, SC, without specifying that this is because
        they have the same coordinates or longitude. The model does not provide any
        reason for its NO answer that suggests equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO. 60626,
        IL is not located west of 29405, SC." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        to the instructions, I must answer False to this question. The model did not
        give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "Yes" statement,
        explicitly affirming that "60626, IL is located west of 29405, SC." This is
        a direct YES answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was classified as YES, not
        NO. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should
        put False as the answer to this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "Sure, 98311, WA is located
        west of 85132, AZ. It is in the western United States." This is a clear affirmative
        statement that 98311, WA is west of 85132, AZ. While the model doesn't explicitly
        say "YES" as a standalone word, the response is unambiguously affirming the
        comparison with "Sure" followed by a direct statement of the relationship,
        which functions as a "YES" answer.

    6ccf9192-af54-4fa9-ad8a-cd173897bcd1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the two zip
        codes are at the same location or have equal longitude values. It simply states
        that 98311, WA is not located west of 85132, AZ without providing equality
        as the reason. The model doesn't mention any equality between the locations
        as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, 98311, WA is
        not located west of 85132, AZ." This is a clear negative statement about the
        comparison, but it doesn't explicitly state "NO" as a standalone answer. However,
        the statement "is not located west of" is a definitive negative comparative
        result, which is equivalent to a "NO" answer to the implied question of whether
        98311, WA is west of 85132, AZ.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    88be8c9b-238a-48dc-a574-42437d2b3d8d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 98311, WA is located east of
        85132, AZ, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        model is claiming there is a spatial difference (east vs. west positioning),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that 98311, WA is located
        east of 85132, AZ. This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.

        whether it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes that "98311, WA is
        located west of 85132, AZ" but does not explicitly state a YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. While the model clearly makes a directional claim,

        not NO, this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides reasoning that "97229, OR is west
        of 90650, CA" and concludes "Therefore, 97229, OR is located west of 90650,
        CA." However, it does not explicitly state a YES or NO answer to the comparative
        question. While it makes a clear directional claim, it doesn't frame the answer
        in the requested YES/NO format.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as YES (not
        NO), according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer, so the question about equal values is
        not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 26041, WV is located
        west of 07070, NJ." This is a clear affirmative statement that the first location
        is west of the second location. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES"
        as a standalone answer, the affirmative "Sure" followed by a direct statement
        confirming the westward relationship indicates a positive response to the
        comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the zip codes are in different
        states (West Virginia vs. New Jersey), implying they are different geographical
        locations. The model is giving a reason for the NO answer based on geographical
        difference, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response. This is a direct and unambiguous negative answer
        to the comparative question.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it
        gave a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides reasoning about the relative positions
        of the locations, concluding that "26041, WV is located west of 07070, NJ."
        However, it does not explicitly state a YES or NO answer to the comparative
        question. The model simply states its conclusion about the geographical relationship
        without framing it as a direct YES/NO response.

        is west of the second location, though it doesn't explicitly use the word
        "YES". However, since the response clearly affirms the comparison without
        qualification, and the criteria specify to use YES if the model explicitly
        states YES, I need to determine if this counts as an explicit YES. Since there's
        no explicit "YES" in the answer, but rather a clear affirmative statement,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply outlines steps to find coordinates and then
        gives a "NO" answer without explaining the reason. There is no mention of
        the locations having equal or identical coordinates as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model''s final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. It provides a step-by-step approach to comparing
        the locations and concludes with "Answer: NO".'

        NO), this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about
        equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes that "43160, OH is
        located west of 12549, NY" but does not explicitly state a YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. While the model clearly makes a directional claim,

        NO), according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 43160, OH is located
        west of 12549, NY" which appears to be affirming the comparison, but there
        is no explicit YES statement. The model doesn't provide a clear YES/NO answer
        as required by the question format.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        43207, OH is not located west of 10598, NY, without explaining that this is
        because they have the same location or coordinates. The model did not provide
        any reasoning about equality as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 43207,
        OH is not located west of 10598, NY." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided reasoning that 43207, OH is west
        of 10598, NY because Ohio is west of New York. However, the model did not
        explicitly state a YES or NO answer to the comparison question. The response
        ends with the statement "Therefore, 43207, OH is located west of 10598, NY"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it makes a directional claim that "72114,
        AR is located east of 27009, NC" and bases its NO answer on this directional
        difference. The model is asserting a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        east of 44116, OH, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The model is asserting that one location is east of the other, not that they
        are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "No" and
        then states that "77045, TX is located east of 44116, OH." This is a direct
        NO answer to the comparative question, indicating that whatever the original
        question was asking about direction, the model is explicitly rejecting it
        and providing the opposite direction.

        the values being compared are the same or equal. It simply stated that 27705,
        NC is not located west of 10958, NY. The model did not claim the locations
        have identical coordinates or are the same place as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, 27705, NC is not

        that "27705 is in the southeastern United States, while 10958 is in the northeastern
        United States." The model is giving NO because it found a difference in locations
        (southeast vs. northeast), not because the values are equal.

        geographical regions (southeastern vs. northeastern United States), implying
        a difference in location as the reason for the NO answer. Since the model
        is noting a difference rather than equality, this is not a case where the
        NO is due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the

        - that 27705, NC is in the southeastern US while 10958, NY is in the northeastern
        US, and that the southeastern US is not west of the northeastern US (in fact,
        it implies the opposite geographical relationship).

      explanation_final_answer: The model directly states "76008, TX is located west
        of 70712, LA" without providing a clear YES or NO answer. While the model
        is making a definitive comparative statement, it does not explicitly use the

        The model is asserting that one location is east of the other, not that they
        are the same or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that 76008, TX is located

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one location
        (32095, FL) is east of the other location (03079, NH), indicating a directional
        difference between them. The model is noting a difference in geographical
        position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "NO" and
        then provides an explanation that 32095, FL is located east of 03079, NH.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        32095, FL is not located west of 03079, NH without explaining that this is
        because they have the same location or coordinates. The model did not provide
        any reasoning about equality as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 32095,
        FL is not located west of 03079, NH." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "Sure, 77008, TX is located
        west of 45801, OH. It is in the western United States." This is a clear affirmative
        statement that 77008, TX is west of 45801, OH. While the model doesn't explicitly
        say "YES" as a standalone word, the response is unambiguously affirming the
        comparison with "Sure" followed by a direct statement of the relationship.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reasoning, stating
        that 31210, GA is in the southeastern US while 22150, VA is in the northeastern
        US, and concludes that GA cannot be west of VA based on their relative positions.
        The NO answer is based on a claimed directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional comparison, stating
        that "31210, GA is located east of 22150, VA" and uses this as the reason
        for its NO answer. The model is noting a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided reasoning that 31210, GA is west
        of 22150, VA, but did not explicitly state a YES or NO answer to the comparison
        question. While the model concluded "Therefore, 31210, GA is located west
        of 22150, VA," it did not include an explicit YES or NO in its final answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional comparison, stating
        that "31210, GA is in the state of Georgia, which is west of Virginia" and
        "22150, VA is in the state of Virginia, which is east of Georgia." The model
        then concludes that "31210, GA is located east of 22150, VA" and answers NO.
        The NO is based on a directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 31210, GA
        is located east of 22150, VA, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The model is noting a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that 31210, GA is located east of 22150, VA, which supports its "No"
        answer.

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides reasoning but does not explicitly
        state a YES or NO answer to the comparison question. While it concludes "Therefore,
        31210, GA is located west of 22150, VA," it doesn't explicitly say "YES" or
        "NO" to frame this as an answer to the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values is not
        applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "Yes" statement,
        explicitly answering that 31210, GA is located west of 22150, VA. The answer
        is unambiguous and directly states "Yes" as the comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 31210, GA
        is located east of 22150, VA, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The model is noting a specific directional difference (east
        vs. west positioning) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that 31210, GA is located east of 22150, VA, which supports its "No"
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        78380, TX is not located west of 70065, LA without explaining that this is
        because they have the same longitude or are in the same location. The model
        did not provide any equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 78380,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Texas and Louisiana are not adjacent states, so 78380, TX cannot be
        located west of 70065, LA. This is a geographical reasoning rather than an
        equality claim.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but the reason provided
        was not that the values being compared are the same. Instead, the model stated
        that the locations "are in different states" (VA and NC). The model is pointing
        out a difference between the locations, not stating they are equal or the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "No." This
        is an explicit negative answer to the comparative question. The model then
        explains that the two locations are in different states (VA and NC).

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a step-by-step analysis and concludes
        "Therefore, 24354, VA is located west of 28457, NC." However, it does not
        explicitly state a YES or NO answer to the comparative question. While it
        makes a clear directional statement, it doesn't frame the answer in the requested
        YES/NO format.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply identifies that 91360 is in California
        and 84056 is in Utah. The model doesn't explicitly state that the equality
        (or lack thereof) is the reason for its NO answer. It merely provides information
        about the locations of the zip codes without directly explaining why the answer
        is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the

        to the instructions, I must answer False to this question. The model did not
        claim the values were equal - in fact, it explicitly stated one location is
        west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "Sure, 91360, CA is located
        west of 84056, UT. It is in the western United States." This is clearly affirming
        that the first location is west of the second location, which is equivalent
        to a "YES" answer to the implied comparative question "Is 91360, CA west of
        84056, UT?" The model does not explicitly state "YES" as a standalone answer,
        but the affirmative "Sure" followed by a direct statement of the comparison
        indicates a positive response.

        west of 84056, UT" without indicating that this is because they are at the
        same location or have equal coordinates. The model gives a directional assessment
        rather than claiming equality.
