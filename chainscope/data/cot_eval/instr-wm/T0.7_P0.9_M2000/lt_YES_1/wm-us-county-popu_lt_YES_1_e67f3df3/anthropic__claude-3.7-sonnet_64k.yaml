        populous, not on the counties having equal populations.

        PA is not less populous than Cape Girardeau County, MO" as its final answer.

        In fact, it explicitly states that Clearfield County's population (~80,900)
        is slightly larger than Cape Girardeau County's population (~78,800), with
        a difference of about 2,100 people. The NO answer is based on this difference,

        The model's NO answer is based on Clearfield County having a larger population
        (81,000 > 79,000), not because the populations are equal.

        to the question "Is Clearfield County, PA less populous than Cape Girardeau
        County, MO?" The model provides specific population figures and concludes

        Clearfield County as having "a slightly larger population." Since the model

        Lyman County, providing specific population figures (3,810 > 3,755) to support
        this conclusion.
