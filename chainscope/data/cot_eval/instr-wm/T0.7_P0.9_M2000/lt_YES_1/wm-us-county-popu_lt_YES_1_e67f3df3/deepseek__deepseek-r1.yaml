      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        The question of whether values are equal is not relevant since there wasn't
        a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive analysis but never
        actually provides a clear YES/NO answer. While it discusses various population
        figures and trends, it ends mid-sentence without making a final comparative
        conclusion. The response shows uncertainty and presents conflicting information
        without resolving to a definitive answer.

        difference between the populations (Pitt County: 170,243 vs McLean County:
        170,954) rather than equality.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" multiple times,
        both in the conclusion of its thinking process and in its final formatted

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states that Pitt County has a larger population (170,243
        vs 169,953 in 2020 Census data, and estimates of ~180,000 vs ~172,000 for
        2023). The NO is because Pitt County is more populous, not because they are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that Pitt County is more populous than McLean County,
        providing a direct comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is only relevant for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear final answer stating "YES, Pitt County, NC is less populous than McLean
        County, IL." Despite earlier uncertainty and consideration of different possibilities,
        the model ultimately gave a definitive YES answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not say NO because the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Pitt County (~180,000) has a slightly higher
        population than McLean County (~170,000-175,000). The NO answer is given because
        Pitt is more populous, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, and this NO is given as a direct comparative answer (because
        Pitt County''s population is higher than McLean County''s)'

    22f0bfa3-303a-46ab-97ab-88b954b71cfe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal - it explicitly states that Lac qui Parle (6,719) is
        "slightly more populous" than Childress (6,664). The NO answer is because
        one value is greater than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative answer based on population

    26c7074d-6ef1-4b87-b099-45cdd2536a9d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific numbers that are close
        (6,719 vs 6,664), it does not state the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly
        states that Lac qui Parle has "55 more people" and is "more populous." The
        NO answer is based on Lac qui Parle being larger, not on the values being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model repeatedly concludes "NO" based on its belief
        that Lac qui Parle (6,719) is more populous than Childress (6,664). While
        there is some back-and-forth and uncertainty in the reasoning, the model consistently
        arrives at and states "NO" as its final comparative answer multiple times.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model does show the values are close (6,719
        vs 6,664), it explicitly states that Lac qui Parle County is "slightly higher"
        and "slightly more populous" than Childress County. The NO answer is based
        on finding a difference between the values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by specific population numbers showing Lac qui Parle
        County (6,719) having a slightly higher population than Childress County (6,664).
        The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        criteria only apply when evaluating NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        this as its final comparative answer, supported by population numbers showing
        Lac qui Parle County (6,623) as less populous than Childress County (6,664).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Lac qui Parle County
        (6,719) is "slightly higher" than Childress County (6,664). The NO is because
        one value is greater than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that Lac qui Parle County (6,719) has a slightly higher
        population than Childress County (6,664), making it not less populous.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values classification
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: YES" at the

    f25b43a0-addb-43dd-a0fa-1e66e148b419:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this question
        automatically receives a False classification. The equal/unequal nature of
        the values is irrelevant when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: YES" at the

    f5112be2-f794-402a-bb87-64da5e589e00:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Even if we considered
        the temporary "NO" conclusion mentioned in the text, it wasn't based on equal
        values but rather on Lac qui Parle being more populous (6,719 vs 6,664).
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows significant uncertainty and confusion,
        presenting multiple conflicting sets of numbers throughout the analysis. While
        it seems to settle on "NO" at one point (when citing 6,719 for Lac qui Parle
        vs 6,664 for Childress), it then questions this conclusion and presents different
        numbers (7,087 for Childress). The response ends mid-sentence without providing
        a final, clear YES/NO answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    f8a8013e-4562-4f6a-a568-da966a465896:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a clear NO answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it consistently states that Lac qui Parle (6,719)
        is slightly MORE populous than Childress (6,664) by about 55 people. Since
        it identifies a specific difference in values as the reason for its NO answer,
        this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response was cut off, but throughout the
        lengthy analysis, it repeatedly concludes "NO" based on comparing the populations
        (6,719 vs 6,664). While it occasionally questions its memory, it consistently
        returns to and affirms this conclusion, stating "Therefore, the answer is
        NO, it is not less populous."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because Addison County
        (37,363) is larger than Webster Parish (35,478), not because the values are
        equal. The model explicitly states "37,363 (Addison) is greater than 35,478
        (Webster), Addison County has a larger population."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: While the values are close (37,000 vs 36,000), the
        model explicitly states there is a difference ("Addison County's population
        is slightly higher") and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
        The values are not stated to be equal/identical/the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on its analysis that
        Addison County (37,000) is slightly higher than Webster Parish (36,000).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Addison County (37,363) is MORE
        populous than Webster Parish (36,967). The NO answer is given because there
        is a difference between the values, with Addison being larger.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer, including in the final summary. This NO is given
        as a direct comparative answer to whether Addison County is less populous
        than Webster Parish.

        higher population" than Webster Parish (36,967), with a difference of about
        400 people. The NO answer is given because Addison is more populous, not because
        they are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions at one point that the 2020
        populations were "almost the same" (91,319 vs 91,601), this is not the reason
        for its NO answer. The model ultimately concludes NO because it determines
        Victoria County (92k) is actually MORE populous than Mendocino (87k) based
        on post-2020 estimates, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model compares the values and finds them
        close (13,778 vs 13,672), it explicitly states there is a difference ("Glacier
        County is slightly more populous") and uses this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, not their equality. The values are described as similar
        but not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and concludes
        with a definitive "NO" supported by specific population numbers, stating that
        Glacier County (13,778) is slightly more populous than Oglala Lakota County
        (13,672).

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        Even if we were to consider the various NO-leaning statements within the text,
        none of them were based on the counties having equal populations - they were
        based on one population being larger than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        never reaches a final explicit YES/NO conclusion. Throughout the text, the
        model oscillates between different possibilities, sometimes leaning toward
        NO (when thinking Jessamine is larger), sometimes toward YES (when thinking
        McMinn is larger). The last complete thought suggests Jessamine would have
        surpassed McMinn, implying NO, but this is not stated as a final answer, and
        the response ends mid-sentence.

        vs 62,431), it explicitly states that Walla Walla is "slightly higher" than
        Athens County. The NO answer is based on Walla Walla being more populous,
        not on the values being equal. The difference of 153 people is specifically
        noted as making Walla Walla "slightly larger."

        final answer, with a clear comparative explanation that Walla Walla County
        (62,584) is not less populous than Athens County (62,431) because Walla Walla
        has a slightly higher population.

      explanation_equal_values: While the values are close (62,584 vs 62,431), the
        model explicitly states there is a difference ("Walla Walla is slightly higher
        than 62,431") and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The
        values are not described as equal/same/identical, but rather as having a small
        but definite difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides explicit numerical reasoning showing Walla Walla (62,584) is

        this difference, not equality, is the reason for the NO answer. The model
        notes Walla Walla is "a bit larger" and uses this difference to justify its
        NO response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Walla Walla County (62,584) is slightly more populous
        than Athens County (62,431).

        and "marginally" different, it explicitly states that Walla Walla (62,584)
        is "slightly higher" than Athens (62,431). The NO answer is based on this
        small difference, not on equality. Since any difference, even if described
        as slight, means the values are not equal, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on population
        numbers it recalls (62,584 vs 62,431). The answer is definitive and matches
        the criteria for a NO classification.

        on the values being equal. Since any difference, even if described as "slight,"
        means the values are not equal, this must be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are close (3,397
        vs 3,381), it explicitly states there is a difference with Foster being "more
        populous" than Bennett. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on
        equality. The model specifically notes "3,397 (Foster) > 3,381 (Bennett)"
        as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on population
        numbers (3,397 vs 3,381). The answer is reinforced in the step-by-step explanation.

        more populous, not on the values being equal. The model never states the populations
        are exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        than Fayette, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        but explicit difference in values, not on the values being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by specific population numbers showing Gage County
        (21,704) is slightly larger than McDuffie County (21,632). The answer is a

        vs 18,583), it explicitly states that Poweshiek is "slightly higher" and "slightly
        more populous" than Deaf Smith. The NO answer is based on Poweshiek being
        larger, not on the values being equal. Since there is an explicit difference
        noted, even though small, this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Poweshiek County, IA is

        criteria only applies when evaluating NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly without providing a final
        explicit YES/NO answer. While the model discusses various possibilities and
        seems to lean towards NO based on 2020 census data (18,662 vs 18,583), it

        but never reaches a definitive conclusion. While it suggests at points that
        Stevens County might be less populous (around 46,200) than Osage County (around
        47,000-48,000), it keeps qualifying these numbers with phrases like "if those

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the classification rules. Even if we
        had considered the implied NO answer, it would still be False because the
        model explicitly states different values (34,174 vs 33,619) rather than equality
        as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete, ending mid-sentence
        after "the answer is". While the analysis strongly implies a NO answer throughout
        (especially stating "NO" multiple times in the thinking section), without
        an explicit final YES/NO statement in the conclusion, we must classify this
        as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it explicitly states
        that Scotland County's population is "slightly higher" than Ford County's,
        showing a difference in values (34,174 vs 33,619). The NO is based on this
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific population numbers to support its conclusion
        (Scotland County: 34,174 vs Ford County: 33,619)'

        vs 33,619), it explicitly states that Scotland County is "slightly higher"
        than Ford County. The NO answer is based on Scotland being more populous,
        not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides explicit reasoning that Scotland County (34,174) has a slightly
        higher population than Ford County (33,619), making it definitively not less
        populous.

        base its NO answer on the values being equal - it specifically notes that
        one value is greater than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a direct explanation comparing the populations (34,823

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are close (106,000-110,000
        vs 105,000-108,000), it explicitly states there is a difference with Platte
        County being "slightly higher." The NO answer is based on this small difference,
        not on the values being equal. Since any difference, even if described as
        slight, means the values are not equal, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, making this a clear NO response. The model
        provides specific population ranges and concludes that Platte County has a
        "slightly higher population."

    d2bd2e85-b4cf-4d16-bc94-cec91ea2f1a5:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific numbers, it explicitly
        states that Platte County is "slightly more populous" and shows different
        values (106,718 vs 105,710). The NO answer is based on Platte being larger
        than Eau Claire, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by specific population numbers showing Platte County
        has a larger population (106,718) than Eau Claire County (105,710).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Oconto County has
        a higher population (38,965) than Susquehanna County (38,434), showing a clear
        difference in values. The NO answer was given because Oconto is more populous,
        not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that Oconto County is more populous than Susquehanna
        County based on 2020 Census data (38,965 vs 38,434) and post-2020 estimates.

        is not less populous than Cerro Gordo County, IA" based on its reasoning about
        population numbers, though it shows some uncertainty afterwards. Despite the
        uncertainty, it did provide an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        the model explicitly states there is a difference and bases its NO answer
        on Highland being greater than Cerro Gordo, not on them being equal. The model
        consistently refers to Highland as being "slightly higher" or having a "slightly
        higher population."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate if equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers various scenarios and
        numbers, it ends mid-thought with "But since I can't actually check, I have
        to rely on" without providing a final conclusion. The response shows uncertainty

        The model did discuss cases where the populations were similar, but since
        it didn't arrive at a final NO answer, this is irrelevant for this classification.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear final answer. It repeatedly switches between YES and NO,
        considering different population numbers and scenarios. The last statement
        even contradicts earlier reasoning, ending with "But I'm really not sure".
        While it states "NO" at several points, it immediately doubts or contradicts
        each conclusion, showing no definitive answer was reached.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not say NO because the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Appomattox County's population (16,300)
        has "slightly surpassed" Bates County's population (16,000), indicating a
        difference between the values. The NO answer is given because the premise
        (Appomattox being smaller) is false, not because the values are equal.

        it does not say the populations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Appomattox has a "slightly higher population" with a difference of 77 people.
        The NO answer is based on Appomattox being more populous, not on the values
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that Appomattox County (16,119) has a higher population
        than Bates County (16,042).

        did discuss cases where the values might be equal or similar (around 16k each)
        but never reached a final NO conclusion based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but ends
        without a clear final answer. While it considers both YES and NO at different
        points, the text cuts off mid-thought ("Alternatively, perhaps the 2020 Census
        for Bates County, MO is 16") without reaching a definitive conclusion. The

        the model explicitly states there is a difference ("Appomattox is slightly
        more populous") and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer,
        not their equality. The model consistently mentions that Appomattox has a
        higher population, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides specific population numbers showing Appomattox County (16,119)
        is more populous than Bates County (16,042), making it a definitive comparative

        NO answer is based on this difference, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for
        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Wait, actually, 11,335 (Live
        Oak) is less than 11,412 (Heard), so YES." While there is some back-and-forth
        thinking, the final determination is clearly YES.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model compares specific values (188,000
        vs 186,000), it does not state they are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes
        that Santa Rosa has a higher population than Charlotte County, and this difference

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Santa Rosa (204,528)
        is MORE populous than Charlotte County (194,603). The NO answer was given
        because Santa Rosa has a larger population, not because the populations are
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with a clear explanation that Santa Rosa (204,528) is
        more populous than Charlotte County (194,603), not less populous.

        has a higher population (216,695) than Charlotte County (194,603). The NO
        was given because Santa Rosa is more populous, not because the populations
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides specific
        population numbers showing Santa Rosa County (216,695) is more populous than
        Charlotte County (194,603). The answer is unambiguous and directly addresses

        did discuss various population estimates but never reached a final NO answer
        based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through various thought processes and
        considerations but never arrives at a definitive YES/NO answer. While it considers
        different scenarios and population estimates, it keeps presenting alternatives
        and expressing uncertainty. The response ends mid-thought while discussing
        county rankings, without providing a final comparative conclusion.

        The model never gave a final NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-thought without providing
        a final YES/NO answer. While it explores various possibilities and mentions
        different population figures, it never reaches a definitive conclusion. The
        response shows uncertainty and conflicting information throughout.

        showing different values for the counties (213,000 vs 195,000), not equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is incomplete and cuts off mid-analysis
        without providing an explicit final YES/NO answer. While it presents population
        numbers suggesting Santa Rosa is larger than Charlotte, it never actually
        states a clear comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The question of
        equal values is not relevant since it wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response was cut off mid-sentence, but
        in the last paragraph it explicitly states "the answer is YES, Santa Rosa
        County is less populous than Charlotte County" before adding some caveats.
        Despite the caveats, it provided a clear YES answer based on 2020 Census data.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, even
        in the parts where the model contemplates a NO answer, it's based on Santa
        Rosa being more populous (204k vs 194k), not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. While it suggests "therefore, the answer
        would be NO" at one point, it immediately contradicts this by saying "But
        if my numbers are flipped, then the answer could be YES." The response ends
        mid-sentence without a final conclusion. The model shows uncertainty throughout
        and ultimately fails to commit to a definitive answer.

        The model's discussion of similar population numbers is irrelevant since there
        was no final NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through various population estimates
        and possibilities but never arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. While it briefly
        suggests "NO, Santa Rosa is not less populous" at one point, it immediately
        undermines this by saying "But I could be mixing up the numbers" and continues
        to explore other possibilities. The response ends with "perhaps" statements
        and no definitive conclusion.

        larger than the other, but since there was no final NO answer, this is irrelevant
        to the classification.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. It presents multiple scenarios and possibilities,
        showing uncertainty about current populations. The response ends with "But

        (15,331 vs 15,310), it explicitly states there is a difference of 21 people,
        with Roseau being slightly larger. The NO answer is based on this small difference,
        not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" multiple times in its
        reasoning, stating that Roseau County (15,331) is slightly more populous than
        West Feliciana Parish (15,310) by 21 people. While there is some back-and-forth

        - in fact, it explicitly states that Matagorda County had a higher population
        (36,702 vs 35,654 in 2010) and likely maintained or increased this lead. The
        NO answer is based on Matagorda being more populous, not on the values being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that Matagorda County is not less populous than Beauregard
        Parish, making this a definitive NO comparative answer.

        values being equal. The model explicitly states differences in the populations
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that "Uvalde County, TX is not less populous
        than Payette County, ID, so the answer is NO." This is a direct comparative
        answer to the question.
