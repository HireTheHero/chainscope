    00d0149f-ec73-48cf-ae79-f5a03be99b64:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Pitt County's population (172,148)
        is greater than McLean County's population (171,108), which was the reason
        for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding Pitt County's population (172,148)
        to be greater than McLean County's population (171,108)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1ac20fb8-9db7-499b-8d78-0bfe83ea9c40:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the population values are close, the model explicitly
        shows they are different (171,234 vs 171,070) and indicates that one is greater
        than the other (171,234 > 171,070). The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations and showing that 171,234 > 171,070.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    436e7ebf-cc3e-47b0-b020-d4a95fff3edc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (170,243 vs
        170,851).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations of the two counties.

      result: 'YES'
    5587a95a-195e-4ccb-b4fa-341812b271fe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        populations were different (171,195 vs 169,572), with Pitt County being more
        populous. The NO was not due to equal values, but rather because one value
        was explicitly larger than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations and finding that Pitt County
        has a larger population than McLean County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model found different values (171,451 vs 171,142)
        and explicitly stated that one is greater than the other. The NO answer was
        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after determining that Pitt County has a larger population
        than McLean County.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Pitt County (175,208) has a larger population
        than McLean County (170,695). The NO answer is based on this difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Pitt County has a larger population than McLean County.
        This is a clear NO comparative answer.

        results in False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal
        (100,000 vs 170,000).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows its logic and explicitly
        states "YES" as its final answer after comparing the populations and finding
        that Pitt County's population is less than McLean County's population.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False. Additionally, the model showed different values (162,300 vs 164,440),
        not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and showing that Portage County has a larger
        population (164,440 > 162,300)
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    cb15411b-33f9-40e5-b806-b3d34d4edf8a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model shows that the values are different (168,000
        vs 161,000) and even uses ">" to indicate Hampshire is larger than Portage.
        The NO answer is not based on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, making this an explicit NO response to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly showed they were different (162,300 vs 161,800) and used
        the ">" symbol to indicate Hampshire's population is greater than Portage's
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after showing that Hampshire County (162,300) is greater than Portage
        County (161,800)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly noted that Gwinnett County (996,300) has a larger
        population than Erie County (954,300). The NO answer appears inconsistent
        with the comparison provided, but we must evaluate based on what was stated,
        not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the populations of the two counties.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    49e333cb-d522-4607-ab28-4a1fefb429cf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because Gwinnett County has a larger
        population (996,153) than Erie County (954,236). The values are different,
        not equal, and this difference is the basis for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding Gwinnett County (996,153) is larger
        than Erie County (954,236)

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly noted that Gwinnett County has a "larger" population
        than Erie County (966,727 vs 954,236). The NO answer appears to contradict
        the comparison shown, but we must evaluate based on what was stated, not logical
        consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the populations of the two counties.

    8da0810a-eeb9-4430-a558-a3fe5bcbb449:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated different values
        (968,644 vs 954,236) and even noted that "Gwinnett County is MORE populous
        than Erie County." The NO answer appears contradictory to its own analysis,
        but since it didn't cite equality as the reason for the NO, this should be
        classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative response (though it seems to contradict
        its own analysis showing Gwinnett as more populous). Since we're instructed
        to take the explicit final answer at face value regardless of contradictions,
        this should be classified as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    901d313d-dce5-4536-b753-8954e68510ee:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because Gwinnett County's
        population is larger than Erie County's population, not because the values
        are equal. The model explicitly states different population values (996,919
        vs 954,236)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" after comparing the populations and finding Gwinnett County (996,919)
        is larger than Erie County (954,236)

    c006ed37-42d9-4e92-b9a3-c3846dfcc26d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly stated
        there was a difference in populations (996,385 vs 954,236) and determined
        that Gwinnett County has a larger population. The NO was not based on equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations and finding Gwinnett County's population to be larger than
        Erie County's population. This is a clear comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    c112b5b2-6354-42df-a1ac-ca928143537f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The response consists only of the word "SAFETY" which
        appears to be a safety/moderation message rather than an actual comparative
        answer. This is effectively a refusal to engage with the comparison.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    d4b8eae3-3711-410d-b4c1-0b36fd3c7acc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted the populations are "very similar,"
        it explicitly stated that Gwinnett has a "slightly larger population." Since
        it identified a difference (even if small), this is not a case of equal values
        being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations and finding Gwinnett to be slightly larger. This is a clear
        comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it showed that Gwinnett County (966,614) has
        a larger population than Erie County (954,236), explicitly stating "Gwinnett
        County is more populous." The NO answer was due to this difference in values,
        not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Gwinnett County has a smaller population than Erie
        County, after showing that Gwinnett (966,614) is more populous than Erie (954,236).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it actually showed
        the values are different (957,000 vs 954,000) and explicitly stated they are
        not equal using the ">" symbol. The NO was not based on the values being the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the values were equal. In fact, it explicitly showed that the values
        were different (25,066 > 24,088), so this is not a case where NO was given
        because the values were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations and showing that 25,066 > 24,088.

        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The actual population values
        or their similarity is irrelevant since we didn't get a final NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-sentence and
        doesn't provide a complete comparison or final YES/NO answer. While it provides
        population numbers, it doesn't reach a conclusion.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        Kane County, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final answer, indicating that Adams
        County is not less populous than Kane County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different values (66,300
        vs 65,900) and the NO answer is based on Sauk County having a larger population,
        not because the values are equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" after comparing the populations of Sauk County (66,300) and Starr County
        (65,900)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different values (66,420
        vs 65,707) and answers NO because Sauk County's population is larger than
        Starr County's, not because they are equal. The values are explicitly different,
        not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" after comparing the populations of the two counties, making this a
        clear NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model clearly states different values for the
        populations (66,732 vs 65,915) and indicates Sauk County has a larger population.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of values
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Sauk County has a larger population than Starr County

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Sauk County (66,236)
        has a larger population than Starr County (65,833). Since it identifies a
        difference in values rather than equality, this is not a case of equal values
        being the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states different values (66,000 vs 65,000) and concludes
        that "Sauk County has a larger population." The NO answer is based on Sauk
        being larger, not on the values being equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Sauk County's population is smaller than Starr County's,
        after comparing their populations (66,000 vs 65,000)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows that the values are different
        (43,074 vs 42,425) and states "43,074 is greater than 42,425" before giving
        its NO answer. The values are not equal, and equality is not given as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations, making this a definitive NO
        response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Highland County (43,083)
        is greater than Cerro Gordo County (42,603). The NO is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that Highland County is not less populous than Cerro
        Gordo County because 43,083 > 42,603.

        answer, though this seems inconsistent with its reasoning that showed Uvalde
        County has a larger population. Since we're instructed to analyze only what
        was explicitly stated and take the final answer at face value, the answer
        is NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
