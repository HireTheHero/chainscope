    00079793-f98b-4cb6-a846-9a647c9b78b8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly stated there was a difference
        in populations (175,842 > 170,954) and used this difference, not equality,
        as the reason for its NO answer. The values were not described as equal or
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Pitt County has MORE people than McLean County, making a clear comparative
        statement that rejects the premise that Pitt County is less populous.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5395843b-d0d4-4aed-b1c2-ceb4eff3a6c5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - it actually specifies that "Pitt County has grown more recently and is slightly
        larger." Since it notes a difference (even if slight), this is not a case
        where NO was given because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and states
        "Pitt County is NOT less populous than McLean County" - this is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    711e2373-480e-43e8-92b7-195c8acc60fa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the counties are "very similar
        in size," it explicitly states that Pitt County is "slightly larger, with
        a few thousand more residents." This difference, even though small, means
        the values are not equal, and this inequality is part of the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, explaining that Pitt County is more populous than McLean
        County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7df84dc0-9f24-4a49-af05-7af972353059:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are "very similar,"
        it explicitly states that Pitt County is "slightly larger" with specific different
        ranges (175,000-180,000 vs 170,000-175,000). The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether Pitt County is less populous than McLean County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    85421119-2818-42ec-b068-6eccc076e220:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - it explicitly notes that "Pitt County is slightly larger, with a few thousand
        more residents." While it notes they are "fairly similar," it clearly indicates
        a difference in size as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Pitt County, NC
        is not less populous than McLean County, IL" as its final comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    94d4450d-00c7-4e8e-bfca-658787de11da:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - it explicitly notes that "Pitt County is slightly larger than McLean County
        by about 1,000 people". Even though the difference is small, any stated difference
        means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Pitt County is not
        less populous than McLean County)" as its final comparative answer, providing
        a clear NO response with reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b76ea366-60d1-4f2b-ae4e-21d918467689:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the populations are "very
        close," it explicitly states that "Pitt County is slightly larger." Since
        it identifies a difference (even if small), this is not a case where the NO
        answer was given because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that Pitt County is NOT less populous than McLean County.
        This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d178e97a-2aa5-4ae7-96b0-bf4e728762fb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted the populations are "very close,"
        it explicitly stated that "Pitt County is slightly larger" and based its NO
        answer on this difference, not on equality. Any difference, even if described
        as slight, means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether Pitt County is less populous than McLean County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d8c5bf0a-6832-4df5-87be-53ecd60ad424:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Pitt County has a
        larger population than McLean County (180,000-185,000 vs 170,000-175,000).
        The NO answer was given because of this difference in values, not because
        the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that Pitt County is MORE populous
        than McLean County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fbc6526d-3e5a-4715-918d-887561d7caad:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly noted a difference (175,000 > 171,000) and used this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer. The NO was because Pitt County was found
        to be MORE populous, not because the values were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations and determining that Pitt County is more populous than McLean
        County. This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions the populations are "very
        close," it explicitly states that Jefferson Parish is "slightly larger" than
        Santa Barbara County. This indicates the values are not equal, and the NO
        answer is based on the direction being opposite to what was asked (Jefferson
        Parish being larger, not smaller), not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Jefferson Parish
        is not less populous than Santa Barbara County" as its comparative conclusion,
        making this a clear NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that Union County is NOT less populous than Delaware County. This is a direct
        NO answer to the comparative question.

        the populations and determining that Durham County is more populous than Fayette
        County. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference, with Durham County
        being "slightly larger" (325,000) than Fayette County (322,000). Even though
        the difference is small, any stated difference means this should be classified
        as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Whiteside County
        has "slightly more residents than Pearl River County" and gives approximate
        values showing a difference (Whiteside ~56,000 vs Pearl River ~55,000). The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Whiteside County
        is NOT less populous than Pearl River County)" as its final answer. This is
        a clear NO comparative result.

        McDonough County (29,000) to be larger than Peach County (27,000), not because
        the values are equal. It explicitly states the difference in values and bases
        its NO answer on McDonough being larger.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that McDonough County
        (29,000) is larger than Peach County (27,000), and this difference in values
        is the reason for the NO answer. The values are not equal or same, so this
        is not a case of equal values leading to the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (McDonough County is NOT
        less populous than Peach County). The answer is explicit and definitive.

      result: 'NO'
    6f67814a-0d6a-419e-95f4-6eea6e16dc32:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the populations
        were different (29,000 vs 27,000) and concluded NO because McDonough County
        was more populous, not less populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that McDonough County (29,000)
        is more populous than Peach County (27,000), not less populous.

    8fd51a83-ef48-4d52-8228-bbe67921e6d6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly states that McDonough County has 29,000
        residents while Peach County has 27,000 residents, and concludes NO because
        McDonough County has MORE people (not the same number). Since the NO is based
        on a difference in values rather than equality, this should be classified
        as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (McDonough County is NOT
        less populous than Peach County). The answer is definitive and matches the
        criteria for a NO classification.

        is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that Contra Costa County is not less populous than Salt Lake County (while
        actually contradicting itself since it then says Salt Lake County is slightly
        larger). Taking the explicit NO at face value as instructed.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly stated there was a difference
        in populations (80,000 vs 79,000) and gave this difference as the reason for
        the NO answer, not because the values were equal. The model specifically noted
        that Clearfield County was "slightly larger."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Clearfield County has a larger population than Cape Girardeau County.

        it explicitly states differences in the values (both in its numerical comparison
        showing St. Tammany as larger, and in its conclusion stating Marin is "slightly
        larger"). The NO answer is not based on the values being exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Marin County is
        not less populous than St. Tammany Parish" as its comparative conclusion,
        though it contradicts its own analysis. Despite the contradiction, we take
        the explicit NO at face value.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are "very similar,"
        it actually contradicts itself - first saying Fairfax City is "slightly larger"
        but then concluding they're "very similar (both around 24,000 residents)."
        Since there's this contradiction and the model mentions a size difference
        at one point, we cannot definitively say the NO answer was based purely on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Hood River County
        is not less populous than Fairfax City" as its final comparative conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly noted that De Soto Parish (27,000) is more populous than
        Marlboro County (26,000). The NO answer was given because one value was greater
        than the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that De Soto Parish has more people than Marlboro County. This is a clear
        comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    db5a72a4-fb92-403b-be8b-ddb4724bd007:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (27,000
        vs 26,000) and concludes NO because De Soto Parish has MORE people than Marlboro
        County, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that De Soto Parish is NOT less populous
        than Marlboro County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e51296e8-0f35-4fcf-9383-7587cdf24528:

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (27,000
        vs 26,000) and states "De Soto Parish has a larger population than Marlboro
        County" as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative reasoning showing De Soto Parish (27,000) is larger
        than Marlboro County (26,000)
      final_answer: 'NO'

    ec6159a3-6f6e-4d62-9ae6-4ae1c866285c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (27,000
        vs 26,000) and concludes NO because De Soto Parish is larger, not because
        the values are equal. The NO answer is based on one value being greater than
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that De Soto Parish is NOT less populous
        than Marlboro County.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The contradictory
        nature of the response is irrelevant for this question once we've determined
        the answer wasn't clearly NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives contradictory answers - first saying
        "NO" and then immediately saying "The answer is YES." Since these directly
        conflict and we cannot resolve contradictions, this results in no clear YES/NO
        answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they are "very close in population,"
        it actually states earlier that "Amelia County has slightly more residents
        than Lamb County." Since it indicates there is a difference (even if slight),
        this does not qualify as stating they are exactly equal as the primary reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Lamb County, TX
        is not less populous than Amelia County, VA" as its final comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated that Racine County (200,000)
        is larger than Broome County (190,000), showing a clear difference in values.
        The NO was given because the relationship was in the opposite direction, not
        because the values were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that the premise (Racine County having a smaller
        population) is false because Racine County actually has a larger population.

    11faf680-0b12-47eb-947b-2f907d05ca78:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are "very close,"
        it explicitly states that "Cerro Gordo County appears to have slightly more
        residents" and describes Cerro Gordo as "being slightly larger." Since it
        identifies a difference in values (even if small), this does not qualify as
        stating they are equal/identical/the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Highland County,
        OH is not less populous than Cerro Gordo County, IA" as its final comparative
        conclusion. While it notes they are close in population, it gives a clear
        NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are "very close,"
        it explicitly states that Cerro Gordo County is "slightly larger." Any difference,
        even if described as slight, means the values are not exactly equal, and this
        difference is part of the explanation for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, indicating that Highland County is not less populous than
        Cerro Gordo County (while noting Cerro Gordo is slightly larger)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Uvalde County has
        "slightly more people" and gives different population estimates (~25,500 vs
        ~24,500). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and "Uvalde
        County is NOT less populous than Payette County", providing a definitive comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a difference in values (8,800 vs 8,500) and uses this difference
        as the reason for its answer ("Since Mathews County has more residents than
        Archer County"). The values are not equal or same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (indicating Mathews County
        is NOT less populous than Archer County). The answer is explicit and unambiguous.
