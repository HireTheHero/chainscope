      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Pitt County's population
        (172,879) is greater than McLean County's population (170,954), and this difference
        was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        vs 6,664) and concludes NO because one is larger than the other, not because
        they are equal. The values are clearly different and this difference is the

        Parle County is "more populous than" Childress County. The NO answer was given
        because one population is larger than the other, not because they are equal.

        after comparing the populations and finding that Lac qui Parle County (6,719)

        - in fact, it explicitly notes that Lac qui Parle County has 6,719 people
        while Childress County has 6,664 people, and uses this difference as the basis
        for its NO answer. The NO is because one value is greater than the other,

        NO answer was given because of this difference in values, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Thurston County is less populous than Leon County. The model provides
        a clear comparative result showing Thurston County (294,074) is more populous

        is greater than Leon County (292,198), showing a clear difference in values.
        This difference, not equality, is the reason for the NO answer.

        being more populous, not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Creek County is less populous than Robertson County.
        The model provides specific population numbers and makes a direct comparison
        showing Creek County has a higher population.

        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (Platte County is not
        less populous than Eau Claire County). The answer is explicit and unambiguous.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Platte County (106,718)
        has a higher population than Eau Claire County (105,710), showing a clear
        difference in values.

        than Marlboro County and provides different population numbers (27,463 vs
        26,667/27,125). The NO answer is based on De Soto being more populous, not
        on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether De Soto Parish is less populous than Marlboro County, and provides

        vs 26,667) and concludes NO because De Soto Parish has a larger population,
        not because the values are equal. The NO answer is based on one value being
        greater than the other, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether De Soto Parish is less populous than Marlboro County. The answer

        is more populous than Marlboro County (26,667). The NO answer was given because
        of this difference in population, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether De Soto Parish is less populous than Marlboro County. The answer
        is clear and direct, comparing the populations (27,463 vs 26,667) and concluding

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in populations (17,654 vs 17,219) and concludes NO because Tama County is
        MORE populous, not because the values are equal. The NO answer is based on
        a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its

        has a larger population than Manassas Park City (17,219). The values are different,
        and the NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        Tama County (17,654) to be MORE populous than Manassas Park City (17,219),
        not because the values are equal. It explicitly states there is a difference
        in population numbers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        is greater than Freestone County (12,369), showing a clear difference in values.
        The NO answer was given because Langlade County was found to be more populous,
        not equally populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that Langlade County has a greater
        population than Freestone County.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Langlade County is less populous than Freestone County, providing

        because of this difference in values, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is not relevant since this only matters for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite expressing uncertainty in its reasoning. While the
