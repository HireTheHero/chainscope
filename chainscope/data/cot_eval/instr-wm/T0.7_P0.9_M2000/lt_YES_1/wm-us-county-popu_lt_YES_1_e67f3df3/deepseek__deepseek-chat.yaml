      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in populations (Pitt County at 170,000 vs McLean County at 169,000) and gives
        this difference as the reason for the NO answer, not because the values are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations and finding that Pitt County
        is more populous than McLean County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly states there is a difference (Pitt County has 180,000
        while McLean County has 170,000) and this difference is the reason for the
        NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, while the model noted the populations
        were "very similar," it explicitly stated McLean County was "slightly more
        populous," so they weren't considered equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Pitt County,
        NC, is less populous than McLean County, IL." This is a clear YES answer to
        the comparative question.

        (6,719) has a "slightly larger population" than Childress County (6,664).
        Since it identifies a difference in values and this difference is the reason
        for the NO answer, rather than equality, this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that Lac qui Parle County is NOT less populous than
        Childress County.

        not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that Blount County is NOT less populous than Cambria
        County. This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer is NO, it's not because
        the values are equal. The model explicitly states that Blount County has 135,000
        people while Cambria County has 130,000 people, and indicates that Blount
        County is larger. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on finding that Blount County
        (135,000) has a larger population than Cambria County (130,000).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model actually shows that the values are different
        (135,280 vs 133,472) and even states that "Blount County, TN is more populous
        than Cambria County, PA" before giving its NO answer. While this seems contradictory,
        we must evaluate based on what was stated, not logical consistency. Since
        the values are explicitly shown to be different, this cannot be classified
        as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, making this a clear NO response.

        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference (135,000 vs 130,000)
        and gives this difference as the reason for the NO answer, saying Blount County
        is "more populous."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear explanation that Blount County is more populous than
        Cambria County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        the model explicitly states that Highland County "has a slightly larger population"
        than Cerro Gordo County. Since the model identifies a difference in values
        (even though small) rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer,
        this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on finding Highland County (43,317)
        to be more populous than Cerro Gordo County (43,127).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Highland County
        has a "slightly higher population" than Cerro Gordo County and provided different
        population numbers (43,317 vs 42,450).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that Highland County, OH is not less populous than Cerro
        Gordo County, IA because Highland County has a higher population (43,317 vs
        42,450).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not needed when
        the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that Mathews County is less populous than Archer County.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    93dd2bd0-eedd-49f4-a90b-992537e5d92e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in populations (8,800 vs 8,600) and describes Mathews County as having a "slightly
        higher population." Since it identifies a difference rather than equality
        as the reason for the NO answer, this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        in its response, providing a direct comparative answer that Mathews County,
        VA is not less populous than Archer County, TX.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not needed when
        the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Mathews
        County, VA is less populous than Archer County, TX" after comparing the populations.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (8,500 vs
        8,600).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response, and this matches its comparative analysis showing Mathews
        County has a smaller population than Archer County.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
