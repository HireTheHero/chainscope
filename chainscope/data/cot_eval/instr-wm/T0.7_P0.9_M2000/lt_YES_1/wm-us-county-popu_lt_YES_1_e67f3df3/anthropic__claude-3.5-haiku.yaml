      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        that Pitt County (180,000) is "slightly MORE populous" than McLean County
        (172,000). The NO is based on this difference in values, not on the values
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether Pitt County is less populous than McLean County.
        This is a clear comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    0f47bab9-6c8f-44cb-8a0c-6762b70bb6b1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Pitt County (179,951)
        is greater than McLean County (172,343) and used this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing specific population numbers and reasoning
        for why Pitt County is MORE populous, not less populous than McLean County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a final answer of NO, it did
        not state that the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly calculated
        different values (179,951 vs 172,507) and stated "179,951 is greater than
        172,507". The NO answer was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at
        the end, but this appears to contradict its own analysis which shows Pitt
        County is more populous. However, we must take the explicit final answer as
        stated, regardless of this inconsistency.'

        because the values are equal. Instead, it shows that Charlton County (13,371)
        is actually larger than Camp County (12,782), and this difference is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit comparative reasoning showing Charlton County (13,371) is more

        - in fact, it explicitly calculates and states they are different (28,425
        vs 21,173) and says one is "greater than" the other. While the final NO answer
        seems to contradict the comparison, the model never claims equality as the
        reason for the NO answer.

        this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" to whether

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (39,537
        vs 38,091) and gives the reason for NO as LaGrange being MORE populous than
        Amador, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the populations and finding LaGrange
        County to be more populous than Amador County.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that LaGrange County
        (39,537) is larger than Amador County (38,091), showing different values and
        giving this difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        it shows that they are different (40,137 vs 38,091) and the NO answer is because
        LaGrange is MORE populous than Amador, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and explains
        that LaGrange County is NOT less populous than Amador County, providing a
        direct comparative answer.

        vs 38,091) and states "LaGrange County is larger by 1,446 people" as the reason
        for its NO answer. The NO is not due to equal values, but rather because LaGrange
        County is larger.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" and "Therefore,

        inconsistent with its comparison, it does not cite equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice in its conclusion,
        with "NO, De Soto Parish is NOT less populous than Marlboro County." However,
        this appears to contradict its own numerical comparison where it shows 25,224

        but this appears to contradict its own reasoning where it concludes "Lamb
        County, TX is MORE populous." Despite this contradiction, we must evaluate
        based on the explicit final answer given.

        not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        False according to the criteria. The equal values question only applies when
        analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly went through the comparison step
        by step and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer, both in the reasoning
        and as a standalone answer at the end.

        the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly calculated different values
        (7,738 vs 7,154) and stated one was "greater than" the other. The NO answer
        appears to contradict the reasoning, but we must evaluate based on what was
        stated - different values were given.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this appears to contradict its own reasoning where it concludes "Live
        Oak County, TX is MORE populous." Despite this contradiction, we must evaluate
        based on the explicit final answer given.

        being larger, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
