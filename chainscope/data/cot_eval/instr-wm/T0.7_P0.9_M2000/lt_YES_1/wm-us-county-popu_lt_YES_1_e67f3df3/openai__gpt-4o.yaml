      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Pitt County (180,000)
        has a larger population than McLean County (170,000), showing a clear difference
        in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Pitt County is less populous than McLean County, providing a clear
        comparative result with population figures to support its conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    347bb979-d9cf-4af2-95de-047801227e26:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Pitt County (180,000) is greater
        than McLean County (170,000), showing a clear difference in values as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Pitt County is less populous than McLean County, providing a clear
        comparative result based on population figures it cited (180,000 vs 170,000).

    58fc3ca9-eb55-4ff7-b74c-444aed504223:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different values (Pitt County at
        180,000 vs McLean County at 170,000) and the NO is because Pitt County is
        actually more populous, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Pitt
        County, NC is not less populous than McLean County, IL" as its final answer.
        This is a direct comparative response.

        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (170,243 vs
        170,954).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after comparing the populations and finding Pitt County to
        be less populous than McLean County.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly showed different population values
        (180,000 vs 171,000) and the NO answer was because Pitt County was actually
        more populous, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result indicating that Pitt County is not
        less populous than McLean County (since it found Pitt County to be more populous
        with 180,000 vs 171,000 people).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but not because the values
        are equal - it explicitly states different values (180,000 vs 170,000) and
        the NO is because Pitt County has a larger population than McLean County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Pitt County is less populous than McLean County, after
        comparing their populations (180,000 vs 170,000).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that Pitt County (175,000) is slightly more
        populous than McLean County (170,000). The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Pitt County, NC is
        not less populous than McLean County, IL" as its final comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that McLean County has
        a population of 170,954 which is "slightly more than" Pitt County's 170,243.
        Since it identifies a difference (even though small), and does not state the
        populations are equal/same/identical, this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Pitt County, NC is
        not less populous than McLean County, IL" as its final comparative answer.

    bbc9d306-f454-439a-9621-0bb6716427b0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found Pitt County
        to be MORE populous (180,000) than McLean County (170,000), not because the
        values were equal. The model explicitly noted a difference in population numbers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that Pitt County (180,000) is

        - in fact, it explicitly notes that Lac qui Parle County (6,719) has a "slightly
        larger population" than Childress County (6,664). The NO answer is based on
        this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lac qui Parle County,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly shows different values (6,719 vs 6,664) and uses
        these differences to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is based on finding
        that one value is less than the other, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" after determining that Childress County is less populous than Lac qui
        Parle County. This is a clear NO answer to the comparison.

        equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "Lac qui Parle County, MN, has a
        population slightly higher than the population of Childress County, TX." While
        it notes they are in a similar range, it identifies a difference in population
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lac qui Parle County,
        MN is not less populous than Childress County, TX" as its final conclusion.

        equal - in fact, it explicitly states that Childress County has "generally
        slightly less" population than Lac qui Parle County. The NO answer is given
        because Lac qui Parle has a slightly larger (not equal) population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Lac qui Parle County is less populous than Childress County. The

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in population
        (135,000 vs 130,000) and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that Blount County (135,000) is
        more populous than Cambria County (130,000).

        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Blount County, TN, has a larger
        population than Cambria County, PA." The NO answer is based on Blount being
        larger, not on the populations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Blount County, TN
        is not less populous than Cambria County, PA" as its final comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. In fact, the model explicitly states different values
        (135,000 vs 130,000) and concludes that Blount County is MORE populous than
        Cambria County. The NO answer is because one is larger than the other, not
        because they're equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is clearly given as a direct response to whether Blount County
        is less populous than Cambria County. The model shows its work and provides
        a definitive comparative result.

        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Blount County (135,000)
        has a "slightly larger population" than Cambria County (130,000). The NO answer
        is based on this difference in values, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model indicates that both counties have "similar
        populations" in the range of 13,000 to 14,000 people, but it specifically
        mentions that "the exact numbers can vary slightly" and that populations are
        "close enough" rather than stating they are exactly equal. Since it notes
        potential variation rather than exact equality, and bases its NO on lack of
        definitive evidence rather than proven equality, this doesn't qualify as a
        NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Charlton County,
        GA is not definitively less populous than Camp County, TX" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both counties have "similar
        population figures" and are "roughly equal in population" (approximately 13,000
        each), and this equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer. The
        model does not indicate any difference between the values, only their approximate

      explanation_equal_values: While the model states they have "similar populations,"
        it explicitly notes that "Morehouse Parish typically has a slightly lower

        equality. The NO answer appears to be based on this slight difference rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Barton County,

        25,000 people" and are "roughly equal in population," and this equality is
        the primary reason it concludes NO. The model doesn't indicate any difference
        in values, even a slight one - it presents them as having the same approximate
        population, which is why it cannot say one is less populous than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Barton County, KS
        is not clearly less populous than Morehouse Parish, LA" as its final answer.

        Since it identifies a difference (even if small), this is not a case of equal
        values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that Barton County, KS is not less populous than Morehouse

        a comparison of equal values since it didn't have access to the population
        figures.
      explanation_final_answer: The model laid out steps for how to make the comparison
        but did not provide a definitive YES/NO answer. Instead, it stated it "cannot
        access real-time data" and indicated that one would need to look up the figures
        to make the determination. This is a case where the model indicates it cannot

        of "around 25,000," this wasn't used to give a definitive NO answer, but rather
        to explain why it couldn't make a determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO, Barton County, KS is
        not conclusively less populous than Morehouse Parish, LA" but this is due
        to inability to determine rather than a definitive comparison. The model states
        it "cannot definitively say" and needs "more precise data," making this a

        to or surpassing 160,000 to 170,000" and concludes that "Comal County's population
        exceeds that of Rankin County." The model is indicating a difference in populations,
        not equality, so this is not a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Rankin County,

        population sizes" of "13,000 to 14,000 people," it does not base its NO answer
        on them being equal. Instead, it specifically states that "Glacier County,
        MT often has a slightly higher population than Oglala Lakota County, SD" -
        this difference, even if slight, means the NO is not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO, Glacier County, MT is generally not less populous than Oglala
        Lakota County, SD." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        - it actually states different values (300,000 vs 290,000) and uses this difference
        to conclude NO. The NO answer is based on Thurston being larger (not equal
        to) Leon County.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        (4,500 vs 4,300) and gives NO because Tensas Parish is MORE populous than
        Deuel County, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that Tensas Parish (4,500) is
        more populous than Deuel County (4,300), not less populous as asked in the

        the values were equal. Instead, it clearly showed that Cloud County (8,786)
        has a higher population than Terrell County (8,255), and this difference was
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Cloud County is less populous than Terrell County, and provides
        specific population numbers showing Cloud County (8,786) is more populous

        population than Terrell County (8,531), making them explicitly unequal. The
        NO answer is because Cloud County is more populous, not because they're equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that Cloud County is not less populous than Terrell
        County, providing a direct comparative answer.

    347ae10f-a26e-4d33-904a-6cbdc65253ac:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes similar populations of "approximately
        8,500 people" for both counties, it explicitly states that Terrell County
        is "slightly less than Cloud County's population." This indicates a difference,
        even if small, rather than exact equality. Therefore, the NO answer is based
        on a directional comparison (Cloud County being slightly larger) rather than
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear directional conclusion that Cloud County is not less
        populous than Terrell County.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's because Cloud
        County (9,032) is actually larger than Terrell County (8,860), not because
        they are equal. The model explicitly shows different population values and
        bases its NO answer on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that Cloud County is NOT less populous than Terrell
        County, providing a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer was NO, this was not
        because the populations were equal. The model explicitly showed different
        values (9,032 vs 8,491) and stated that "Cloud County, KS, has a larger population
        than Terrell County, GA." The NO was due to Cloud County being more populous,
        not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Cloud County is less populous than Terrell County, and provides

        Contra Costa County has a "slightly higher population than Salt Lake County."
        Since the model indicates a difference in values (even if slight) rather than
        equality, this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly stated
        different population values (1.1 million vs 1.2 million) and did not claim
        the values were equal. In fact, it stated one was less populous than the other.
        The NO answer appears inconsistent with its reasoning, but we're not evaluating
        correctness - only whether equality was given as the reason for NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with a clear "NO" answer, but
        this appears to contradict its own reasoning where it states "Contra Costa
        County is indeed less populous than Salt Lake County." Despite this logical
        inconsistency, we must evaluate based on the explicit final answer given,
        which was "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the populations were equal. Instead, it indicated Multnomah County is "either
        comparable to or slightly larger than" Snohomish County and concluded Multnomah
        is "generally more populous." Since it noted a difference (Multnomah being
        larger), this does not qualify as equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the populations are "within
        a similar range" and "close," it does not state they are exactly equal. In
        fact, it suggests that Pointe Coupee Parish is "generally slightly more populous
        or about the same" - indicating a slight difference. The NO answer appears
        to be based on Pointe Coupee being slightly larger, not on the values being
        exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        Coupee Parish, LA has a slightly higher population compared to Gaines County,
        TX." Since it indicates a difference (even if slight), rather than exact equality,
        this is not a case where the NO answer was given because the values are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Pointe Coupee
        Parish, LA is not less populous than Gaines County, TX." This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.

        higher population than Gaines County." Since it indicates a difference (even
        if small) rather than exact equality, and this difference is part of the reasoning
        for the NO answer, this does not qualify as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Pointe Coupee Parish,
        LA is not less populous than Gaines County, TX" as its final answer. This
        is a clear NO response to the comparative question.

        - in fact, it explicitly states "Pointe Coupee Parish is slightly more populous

        a difference is still noted, so this is not a case of equal values being the
        reason for the NO answer.

        it actually states that "Pointe Coupee Parish's population is slightly higher

        difference (slightly higher), this is not a case where equality is the primary
        reason for the NO answer.

        though the difference is described as slight, any stated difference means
        this should be classified as False.

        "around 80,000" and are "similar," it explicitly mentions "a slight difference"
        exists and uses this as the basis for its NO conclusion, rather than stating
        they are exactly equal. Per the criteria, any mention of a difference, even
        if slight, means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Clearfield
        County, PA is not less populous than Cape Girardeau County, MO." While there
        is some uncertainty discussed in the reasoning, the model does provide a clear
        NO as its final comparative answer.

        if slight), this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO
        answer.

        as a reason for NO when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer,
        instead stating that "the answer is not straightforwardly clear-cut as YES

        potential slight variations rather than stating they are exactly equal, and
        doesn't explicitly cite equality as the reason for the NO answer, this doesn't
        meet the criteria for a NO based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, De Soto Parish,
        LA is not less populous than Marlboro County, SC, based on general estimates."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population values,
        it explicitly states there is a difference between them (27,000 vs 26,000)
        and notes that De Soto Parish has "slightly more" population. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, clearly indicating that De Soto Parish is not less populous than Marlboro
        County. The answer is direct and unambiguous.

        close" at approximately 26,000 each, it explicitly states that "De Soto Parish,
        LA is slightly more populous than Marlboro County, SC." Since it indicates
        a difference (even if slight), this is not a case where the NO answer was
        given because the values are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, De Soto Parish, LA

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that De Soto Parish (27,000)
        has a "slightly larger population" than Marlboro County (26,000). The NO answer
        was based on this difference in values, not on equality.

        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES/NO answer.
        While it suggests Wakulla County "tends to be slightly more populous," it
        explicitly states that "to provide a definitive answer, the latest population
        figures must be confirmed" and that one "should verify the latest available
        population data." This indicates uncertainty about making a final determination.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it showed Orangeburg County (84,000) as having
        a larger population than Newport County (82,000), making this a clear case
        of inequality where one value exceeds the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that "Orangeburg County, SC is not less
        populous than Newport County, RI."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the populations are equal
        - it actually shows Orangeburg County (84,000) has a slightly larger population
        than Newport County (82,000). The NO answer is because Orangeburg is more
        populous, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Orangeburg County is less populous than Newport County, providing
        a direct comparative result.

        the populations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Orangeburg County
        (85,000) is more populous than Newport County (82,000), showing a clear difference
        in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to the question

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Racine County (197,000)
        has a larger population than Broome County (190,000). The NO is based on this
        difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Racine County, WI
        is not less populous than Broome County, NY" as its final answer. This is

        (197,000 vs 190,000), it does not indicate these values are equal. In fact,
        it shows Racine County has a higher population (197,000) than Broome County
        (190,000). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO; Racine County, WI

        one is less populous than the other, not because they are exactly equal.

        explains that "neither county can be definitively stated as being less populous"
        due to their similar sizes. This equality is the primary reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially indicates it cannot make a definitive

        the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer, stating that Mathews County, VA is less populous than Archer County,
        TX.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, while the model noted similar
        population ranges (8,000-9,000) for both counties, it ultimately indicated
        a difference with "Mathews County, VA tends to have a slightly lower population."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Mathews
        County, VA is less populous than Archer County, TX" after its step-by-step
        analysis.
      final_answer: 'YES'
