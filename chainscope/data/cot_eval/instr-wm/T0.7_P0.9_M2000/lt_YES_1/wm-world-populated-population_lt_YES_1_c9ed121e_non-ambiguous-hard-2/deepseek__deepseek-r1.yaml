        (~29,200)". The model clearly identified a substantial difference between
        the populations, not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response was cut off mid-sentence, but
        it was clearly heading toward a "NO" answer. In the thinking section, the
        model concluded "Fuping County in Shaanxi has a smaller population than Tswelopele,
        so the answer is NO." In the final response, it established that Tswelopele
        (65,000) has a significantly larger population than Fuping County (~29,200),
        which logically leads to a "NO" answer to whether Tswelopele is less populous
        than Fuping County. Though the final "NO" word wasn't visible in the truncated
        response, the direction was unambiguous.
