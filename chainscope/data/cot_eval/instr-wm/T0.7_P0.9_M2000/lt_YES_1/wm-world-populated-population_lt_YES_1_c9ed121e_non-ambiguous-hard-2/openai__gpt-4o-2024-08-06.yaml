        Instead, it clearly indicates that Fuping County (>750,000 people) has a significantly
        larger population than Tswelopele Local Municipality (~47,000 people). The
        NO answer is based on this difference in population, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Tswelopele Local
        Municipality is not more populous than Fuping County, Shaanxi." This is a
        clear negative answer to the comparison question.
