        difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        positions. The model specifically says "Uri is located north of Koltur" as

        answer because the values being compared are the same, but rather because
        it couldn't determine the relative positions due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO, we cannot definitively
        determine the relative positions without additional information about Koltur's

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        This is not a definitive NO to the comparative question, but rather indicates

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO

        information about Koltur. While it mentions "the answer would be YES" conditionally,

    50e10209-7e65-43ee-ab1f-cc06ad1fcd98:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather due to
        inability to verify one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (based on the inability
        to verify Charodinsky District's location)." This indicates the model is rejecting
        the premise of the question because one of the locations (Charodinsky District)
        cannot be verified to exist or be located. The model is essentially saying
        "NO, I cannot verify" which falls under the UNKNOWN category according to
        the criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (based on the inability
        to verify the existence and location of Charodinsky District)". This is not
        a clear comparative result, but rather indicates the model cannot make the
        comparison because one of the locations cannot be identified. The model is
        rejecting the premise that Charodinsky District exists or can be located,
        making it impossible to determine the north-south relationship.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    7034b9e1-9bf9-491e-8236-33aa2a3acf98:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the location of one of the places.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" but it's given with
        a clarification that the reason is because "the location of Charodinsky District
        is unknown or unclear." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information about one of the locations, which means the
        answer should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative
        result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    8550ff7d-935d-4fa0-8453-acaf524b0e4b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model also indicates that "Charodinsky District does not appear
        to be a real or recognized location" and that "it is impossible to establish
        a geographic relationship between it and Manda Upazila." This means the model
        is rejecting the premise of the question because one of the locations doesn't
        exist, which qualifies as UNKNOWN according to the criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    86cde3fd-2a22-4ed3-b4fe-ae6f42abf2d5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot provide a YES or NO answer"
        because it cannot locate Charodinsky District, which it believes may be misspelled,
        fictional, or obscure. The model is rejecting the premise of the question
        since it cannot verify the existence of one of the locations being compared.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    8a958d42-26ed-46e3-86b3-fdbe888cc5e7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't make the comparison because one location couldn't be identified.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because Charodinsky District
        cannot be identified, making it impossible to establish a relative position)."
        This is a case where the model is rejecting the premise of the question because
        one of the locations doesn't exist or cannot be identified. The model is not
        making a comparative determination about the relative positions, but rather
        stating it cannot make the comparison.

        and not NO, the answer to this question is False according to the instructions
        ("If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer").'
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "the question cannot be answered
        with a definitive YES or NO based on available information" and indicates
        it "cannot accurately provide a YES or NO answer." The model rejects the premise
        of the question by suggesting that Charodinsky District may not exist or may
        be fictional. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model is indicating
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information about one of
        the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "a definitive YES or NO answer cannot
        be provided based on available data" because it cannot identify Charodinsky
        District as a real place. The model is essentially rejecting the premise of
        the question since one of the locations may not exist or could be fictional/misspelled.
