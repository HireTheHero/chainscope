      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated in the
        conclusion as "Yes, Bhedaghat is located south of Odintsovsky District." The
        model explicitly states YES as its comparative result.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    21a7ce73-8de5-4656-98cf-91f442788504:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was REFUSED, not NO, so according
        to the instructions, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" because it lacks information about the locations. This
        indicates the model is refusing to make a comparison due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    53349595-61f2-481a-adec-8227b2d29b42:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" because it lacks information about the locations. This
        indicates the model is refusing to make a comparison due to insufficient information.

      result: 'YES'
    7f228eba-0715-4b21-aa17-f491550024b5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Russia is located north of
        India" and concludes that "Bhedaghat is not located south of Odintsovsky District."
        This indicates a directional difference rather than equality. The model is
        saying NO because the directional relationship is opposite to what was asked
        (it's saying Bhedaghat is north of Odintsovsky District, not south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, indicating a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    aa9dd9b0-6670-4a98-afc0-ce1730cf1ee1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes, Bhedaghat is located
        south of Odintsovsky District" as its conclusion after working through the
        steps of identifying the locations and their relative positions.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    adf48d47-b3dd-42d5-9614-d54aba4314d0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides geographical information about
        Bhedaghat and Odintsovsky District, and concludes that "Bhedaghat is located
        south of Odintsovsky District." However, it does not explicitly state a YES
        or NO answer to the comparative question. The response ends with a conclusion
        about relative positions but without a clear YES/NO verdict.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    cb2c64a3-feff-482d-993b-12e3b7e5b469:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, the
        question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I am unable to provide
        a yes or no answer to this question" and explains that it lacks the necessary
        information. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    d04cec5d-5921-405f-9279-045230342867:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" at the end of its response, making it clear that YES is the final
        answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

    0dabd4cf-25ad-4485-9104-0f95c1f3d8d5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), I must answer False to this question according to the instructions. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Bogor
        is located south of Baramulla district." This is a statement of fact without
        an explicit YES or NO answer to the comparative question. While the model
        makes a directional claim, it doesn't frame its conclusion with a clear YES
        or NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    19c12962-7a66-4c8d-a0d1-75ca02a0178f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Indonesia (where Bogor is located) is south of India (where
        Baramulla is located), and therefore Bogor cannot be south of Baramulla. This
        is a directional reasoning, not an equality claim.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    870230f9-8413-4477-b248-800cc74d2320:

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was REFUSED, not NO, so according
        to the instructions, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" because it lacks information about the locations. This
        indicates the model is refusing to provide a comparative answer due to insufficient
        information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes, Bogor is located
        south of Baramulla district" in its conclusion, making this a clear YES answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    ce430acd-7997-45a2-903b-4ea6257e5357:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional reasoning that Bogor
        "cannot be located south of Baramulla district" because of their hemispheric
        locations. The model is making a geographical comparison based on relative
        positions, not claiming the locations have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its final step of reasoning. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d6173a97-36b6-4962-b606-4af6a072b9f9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated in the
        conclusion as "Yes, Bogor is located south of Baramulla district." The model
        explicitly states YES as its comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    d678fe77-2271-4611-a3a5-f434a932725d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that Bogor is in the southern hemisphere while Baramulla is in
        the northern hemisphere, making it impossible for Bogor to be south of Baramulla.
        The model is not claiming the locations are at the same coordinates or equal
        in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Bogor is not located
        south of Baramulla district" as its conclusion. This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e9e59971-49a6-49ea-b12f-ab1ad74d20df:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" because it lacks information about the locations. This
        indicates the model is refusing to provide a comparative answer due to insufficient
        information.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, Zapotlanejo is located
        south of Mountain Ash, Rhondda Cynon Taf" as its final answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    4c5be230-6540-4108-89fc-2740ad650c72:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states that the question is unclear
        because it doesn't specify which region or location is being referred to.
        This indicates the model is refusing to make a comparison due to insufficient
        information.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    4e9a0fe4-bfaf-43fc-ab2f-be1d78a4231f:

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was REFUSED, not NO, so according
        to the instructions, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I am unable to provide
        a yes or no answer to this question" and explains that it lacks information
        about the location of Zapotlanejo. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative
        answer.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    6ad8ddf2-2c7a-46d4-bd4f-3dda350130fa:

    94222341-c728-47b2-affb-51b022faf322:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it claims that Mountain Ash is located south
        of Zapotlanejo, which is why Zapotlanejo is not south of Mountain Ash. The
        model is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Zapotlanejo is not
        located south of Mountain Ash, Rhondda Cynon Taf." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a780bf03-b9ef-445d-801c-8afdaba9413d:

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was REFUSED, not NO, so according
        to the instructions, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" without giving a YES or NO answer. The model is refusing
        to make the comparison due to lack of information.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    e0ea11f3-d6b1-4b2c-bfae-3af50ad72dd8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not explicitly state YES or NO as a
        final answer. While it concluded "Therefore, Zapotlanejo is located south
        of Mountain Ash, Rhondda Cynon Taf," it did not follow this with an explicit
        YES or NO statement. Without a clear YES/NO answer, this falls under the UNKNOWN
        category.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, but rather a refusal
        to answer the question due to lack of clarity. According to the instructions,
        if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "I'm sorry, but I'm not sure
        what you're asking. Could you please provide more context or clarify your
        question?" This is clearly a refusal to answer because the model indicates
        it doesn't understand the question and requests clarification. It doesn't
        provide any YES/NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically stating that "Dallam County is located north
        of Mexico." This indicates a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "so the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Texas is north of Guatemala" and therefore "San Miguel Petapa
        is not located south of Dallam County, Texas." The model is claiming a directional
        difference (not equality) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it claims that Yongkang District is in the eastern hemisphere while Missouri
        is in the western hemisphere, and that "the eastern hemisphere is above the
        western hemisphere." The model is using relative positioning (above/below)
        rather than equality as its reasoning.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states that "this is a hypothetical
        question, and it does not have a factual answer" and that the answer "would
        depend on the specific locations and distances between the two places, which
        are not given in the context." This indicates the model is refusing to make
        the comparison due to lack of information.

        have equal latitude values. It simply states that Batticaloa is not located
        south of Nalaikh without providing equality as the reason. The model doesn't
        mention that the locations are at the same latitude or are equal in any way.
        It just makes a negative comparative claim without explaining the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Therefore, Batticaloa
        is not located south of Nalaikh." This is a clear negative comparative statement.
        The model is explicitly stating "not" in relation to the comparison of whether
        Batticaloa is south of Nalaikh, which constitutes a NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Batticaloa cannot be located south of Nalaikh because Mongolia
        (where Nalaikh is) is located north of Sri Lanka (where Batticaloa is). This
        implies a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        it then explains that it cannot determine the comparison because the location
        of Thiruparankundram Dargah is not mentioned in the context. This indicates
        the model is saying "NO" because it cannot verify the comparison, not as a

        is in northern Europe. The model is not claiming the locations have equal
        coordinates or positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that the United Kingdom (where Frensham is) is located north of
        the Indian subcontinent (where Namakkal district is), and therefore Namakkal
        cannot be south of Frensham. This is not claiming equality but rather a different
        directional relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Namakkal district
        is not located south of Frensham" as its conclusion. This is a clear NO answer

        - it claims that the United Kingdom is in the northern hemisphere and India
        is in the southern hemisphere (which is actually incorrect, as India is mostly
        in the northern hemisphere). The model is making a directional claim rather
        than an equality claim.

        the locations have equal coordinates or positions, but rather that their relative
        positions don't support the "south of" relationship asked about in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question about whether Moretele Local Municipality is located south of Gicumbi
        District.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        claiming that the Northern Cape province (where it says Moretele is located)
        is north of the Eastern Province (where it says Gicumbi is located). The NO
        is based on a claimed directional difference, not on equality of location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question
        about whether Moretele Local Municipality is located south of Gicumbi District.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reasoning that South
        Australia (where Wattle Range Council is) is in the Southern Hemisphere which
        is "below" the Northern Hemisphere (where Bayview is located). The NO answer
        is based on this geographical difference, not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that Wattle Range Council is in Victoria and the Northern Territory
        is north of Victoria, so Wattle Range Council cannot be south of Bayview.
        This is a directional difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not explicitly state YES or NO as a
        final answer. While the model provided a conclusion that "Mombasa Island is
        located south of Kondagaon district," it did not frame this as a direct YES
        or NO answer to what appears to be a comparative question. Without seeing
        the original question, and without an explicit YES/NO statement, this must

        their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" and then explains that "Mombasa Island is located south of Kondagaon
        district." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Kenya (where Mombasa Island is located) is in the southern hemisphere
        while India (where Kondagaon district is located) is in the northern hemisphere,
        making it impossible for Mombasa Island to be south of Kondagaon district.
        This is a directional difference, not an equality.

        being compared are equal or the same, which would be required to classify
        this as True. Since the model did not explicitly state that the values are
        equal/identical/the same as the reason for its NO answer, this must be classified
        as False.

        the United Kingdom (where Stanwell is) is located north of the United States
        (where Bay Pines is). This is a directional reasoning rather than an equality
        claim.

        - that Bay Pines is in the northern hemisphere while Stanwell is in the southern
        hemisphere, and therefore Bay Pines cannot be south of Stanwell. The model
        is noting a difference in hemispheric location, not equality.

        of Clarenville." The model is not saying NO because the locations are at the
        same latitude, but rather appears to be making a geographical error (since
        if Canada is north of India, then a city in India would be south of a city
        in Canada).

        - it claims that "The eastern hemisphere is above the northern hemisphere"
        and therefore "Fujian cannot be located south of Nebraska." The model is not
        claiming the locations have equal latitude, but rather making a geographical
        reasoning (albeit incorrect) about hemispheres.

        north of Brown County, Nebraska" in step 5, which indicates a directional
        difference (north vs. south). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.

        in the northern hemisphere. This is not claiming equality but rather a different
        geographical relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Puerto Santa Cruz
        cannot be located south of Bathurst Regional Council because Puerto Santa
        Cruz is in the southern hemisphere, and the southern hemisphere is below the
        northern hemisphere. The model is not claiming the locations are identical
        or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Puerto Santa Cruz
        is not located south of Bathurst Regional Council" as its conclusion. This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference, stating
        that "New South Wales is located north of Chile" as the reason for its NO
        answer. This indicates a difference in position rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot provide a clear answer to this question" because
        it lacks information about one of the locations. This indicates the model
        cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a geographical reasoning that
        Puerto Santa Cruz cannot be located south of Bathurst Regional Council because
        Argentina is in the southern hemisphere while Bathurst is in Australia. The

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the reasoning that
        the United Kingdom is north of India, which implies that Mirchaiya (in India)
        would be south of Broseley (in the UK), not the other way around. The model
        is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion states "Therefore, Mirchaiya
        is not located south of Broseley." This is a clear negative comparative statement,
        indicating a "NO" answer to whether Mirchaiya is located south of Broseley.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it concludes that "it is not possible
        to say whether Chikmagalur district is located south of Arakawa, Tokyo, as
        the location of Arakawa, Tokyo is not known from the provided context." This
        indicates the model cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information.

        I must answer False to this question according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. The model simply stated "Therefore, Chikmagalur
        district is located south of Arakawa, Tokyo" without framing it as a YES or
        NO response to the original question. Since there is no clear YES/NO answer,
        this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning based on both locations
        being in the northern hemisphere, concluding that Chikmagalur district cannot
        be located south of Arakawa. This is not based on equality of values but on
        a different geographical reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" in
        its conclusion, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        district cannot be located south of Arakawa, Tokyo" without specifying that
        they are at the same latitude or otherwise equal in position. The model doesn't
        provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it provides a directional reasoning
        that Tokyo is in eastern Japan which is north of Karnataka (where Chikmagalur
        is located). The NO answer is based on a claimed directional difference, not
        on equality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment that Chikmagalur
        district is not located south of Arakawa, Tokyo.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it concludes "Chikmagalur district
        cannot be located south of Arakawa, Tokyo" which implies a different reason
        for the NO answer rather than equality of values. The model doesn't explicitly
        state that the locations have the same latitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it claims that "Balangir district is located
        north of Biak" which implies a directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional relationship, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Hence, the answer to
        the question is NO. Biak is not located south of Balangir district." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional explanation,
        stating that Biak is in eastern Indonesia while Balangir is in western India.
        The NO answer is based on geographical difference, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Biak is not located south of Balangir
        district" which is a clear negative comparative statement, but it does not
        explicitly say "NO" as a final answer. However, the statement is functionally
        equivalent to a "NO" answer to the implied question of whether Biak is located
        south of Balangir district.

        - it claims that Uri is in the northern hemisphere while Koltur is in the
        southern hemisphere (which is actually factually incorrect, as both are in
        the northern hemisphere, but we're evaluating what the model stated, not factual
        accuracy). Since the model is claiming a difference in hemispheric location
        rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer, this is False.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it claims that Munroe Island is in Florida which is in the southeastern
        US, while Riverton is in Washington, and since Florida is south of Washington,
        Munroe Island cannot be south of Riverton. The model is arguing about relative
        positions, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Munroe Island cannot
        be located south of Riverton, Washington" as its conclusion. This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations of Munroe Island and Riverton) are equal or the same. Instead,
        it provides reasoning based on both locations being in Washington and in the
        northern hemisphere, concluding that Munroe Island cannot be south of Riverton.
        The model does not claim the locations are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" in
        Step 7, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Munroe Island is located
        "above" Riverton, Washington, suggesting a difference in position. The NO
        answer appears to be based on this positional relationship rather than equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its conclusion, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reasoning - stating
        that Adams County is in the northern hemisphere while Rio Abajo is in the
        southern hemisphere, and that the northern hemisphere is above the southern
        hemisphere. The model is actually claiming that Rio Abajo is north of Adams
        County (not equal), which is why it answers NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Rio Abajo is not located south of Adams County, Colorado." This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response walks through a step-by-step
        reasoning process about the locations of Adams County, Colorado and Rio Abajo,
        Colombia, concluding that "Rio Abajo is located south of Adams County, Colorado."
        However, the model does not explicitly state a final YES or NO answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reasoning that Europe
        (where Andrijevica is located) is located south of North America (where Gambell,
        Alaska is located), and therefore Andrijevica cannot be located south of Gambell.
        The model is giving a geographical reasoning for its NO answer, not claiming
        the locations have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Andrijevica is not
        located south of Gambell, Alaska" as its conclusion. This is a clear NO answer

        - it claims Montenegro (where Andrijevica is) is in the southern hemisphere
        while the United States (where Gambell is) is in the northern hemisphere,
        and concludes that Andrijevica is not south of Gambell based on this reasoning.
        The model is not claiming the locations have equal latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "Alaska is geographically north
        of Montenegro" as the reason for its NO answer, indicating a directional difference
        rather than equality. The model is claiming that Andrijevica is not south
        of Gambell because Alaska (where Gambell is) is north of Montenegro (where
        Andrijevica is).

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning based on hemispheric
        location, concluding that Campo das Vertentes "cannot be located south of
        Upputhara" because Campo das Vertentes is in the southern hemisphere while
        Upputhara is in the northern hemisphere. The NO answer is based on this directional
        relationship, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        one cannot be south of the other in the way the question implies. The model
        is not claiming the locations have the same coordinates or equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Campo das Vertentes (mesoregion)
        cannot be located south of Upputhara" which is a clear negative comparative
        statement. While it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer, the

        Upputhara is in the northern hemisphere, and concludes that Campo das Vertentes
        cannot be located south of Upputhara based on this hemispheric difference.
        The model is making a claim about relative positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a geographical reasoning that
        both locations are in the northern hemisphere, and therefore Jubb al-Safa
        cannot be south of Crewe. This is not based on equality of values but on a
        directional relationship.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        Jubb al-Safa is located south of Crewe (with Yemen being in the southern hemisphere
        and the UK being in the northern hemisphere). This indicates a difference
        in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "therefore the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of Jubb al-Safa
        and Crewe.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Jubb al-Safa is located south of Crewe" because
        "The United Kingdom is located north of Saudi Arabia." The model is indicating
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Crewe is in northern England while Jubb al-Safa is in southern Yemen,
        indicating they are in completely different geographical locations (with Crewe
        being north of Jubb al-Safa, not south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning based on
        geographic locations (Chad being in Africa, Camden County being in the US,
        and the US being north of Africa) to reach its conclusion. The model is not
        claiming the locations have equal coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Mongo, Chad is not
        located south of Camden County, North Carolina" as its conclusion. This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning based on geographical
        locations (North Carolina being in the US which is north of Africa where Chad
        is located). The NO answer is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Mongo, Chad is not
        located south of Camden County, North Carolina" as its conclusion. This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It states "Mongo, Chad cannot be located south
        of Camden County, North Carolina" which is a conclusion but not formatted
        as a clear YES/NO answer to the original question. Without an explicit YES
        or NO statement, this falls into the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it makes a directional claim, stating "Chad
        is located south of Camden County, North Carolina" and then concludes "NO"
        based on this directional relationship. The model is not claiming equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in Step 6, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the
        reasoning that both locations are in the southern hemisphere, which leads
        to the conclusion that Mangaweka cannot be south of Bungeni. The model doesn't
        claim the locations have equal latitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that Mangaweka is in the Southern Hemisphere while Bungeni is
        in the Northern Hemisphere, and therefore Mangaweka cannot be located south
        of Bungeni. The model is making a directional comparison, not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at

        than NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values were equal; rather, it stated it couldn't
        make the comparison due to lack of information about Bungeni.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer to this
        question is 'NO.'" However, the reasoning indicates the model cannot make
        the comparison because it lacks information about Bungeni ("Bungeni is not
        mentioned in the context"). This is a case where the model is saying "NO"
        because it cannot determine the answer, not as a comparative result.

        - it states that Mangaweka is in the North Island while Bungeni is in the
        South Island, and therefore Mangaweka cannot be located south of Bungeni.
        The reason for the NO is based on relative positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" in

      explanation_final_answer: The model gave multiple "Yes" answers to different
        location comparisons. In the final comparison between Great Yarmouth and Bolivia,
        it explicitly stated "Yes, Great Yarmouth is located south of Bolivia, which
        is in South America." This is a clear YES answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Churchill, Somerset cannot be located south of Vandenberg Village,
        California because the United Kingdom and the United States are in different
        hemispheres. The model is making a directional claim, not an equality claim.

        Additionally, the model did not claim the locations have equal values - it
        actually stated they are in different hemispheres.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        - that Manda Upazila (in Bangladesh) cannot be located south of Charodinsky
        District (in Russia) because the southern hemisphere is below the northern
        hemisphere. The model is making a geographical reasoning claim rather than
        claiming the locations have equal values.

        comparison (Manda Upazila and Charodinsky District), the model concludes "Manda
        Upazila is not located south of Charodinsky District" which is a NO answer.
        For the second comparison (Bhilwara and Charkhi Dadri), the model explicitly
        states "Therefore, the answer is YES. Bhilwara is located south of Charkhi
        Dadri." For the third comparison, the model repeatedly states it cannot provide
        a YES or NO answer due to insufficient information. Since we need to evaluate
        the final answer, and the response ends with the model stating it cannot provide
        a YES or NO answer without more information, the final answer is UNKNOWN.

        explanation for why the answer is NO. There is no mention of the values being
        equal, identical, or the same. Without any explanation about equality being
        the reason for the NO answer, I cannot classify this as being due to equal
        values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that Thousand Islands (Indonesia) cannot be located south of Littlefield,
        Texas because Indonesia is in the eastern hemisphere while Texas is in the
        western hemisphere, and the model incorrectly states that "The eastern hemisphere
        is below the western hemisphere." The NO is based on this geographical reasoning,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment.

        geographic locations (Indonesia being in Southeast Asia and Texas being in
        North America). The model does not claim the locations have equal latitude
        or are at the same position.
