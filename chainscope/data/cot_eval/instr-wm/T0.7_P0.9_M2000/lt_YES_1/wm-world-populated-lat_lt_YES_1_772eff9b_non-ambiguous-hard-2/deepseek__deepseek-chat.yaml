      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "Ziarat District is not directly
        south of Llangollen. Instead, it is located to the east and slightly south
        of Llangollen." The model is noting a difference in position (east and slightly
        south rather than directly south), which is the reason for the NO answer.

        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'
