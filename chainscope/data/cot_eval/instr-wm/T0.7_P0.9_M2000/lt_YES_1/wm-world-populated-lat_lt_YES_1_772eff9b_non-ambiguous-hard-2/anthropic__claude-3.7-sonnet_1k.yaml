      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Rutland Island is
        north of Vicovaro, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is that the locations have different positions
        (north vs. south), not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, clearly indicating that Rutland Island is not located south of Vicovaro.
        The model provides a direct answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Rutland Island is
        actually NORTH of Vicovaro, indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The reason for the NO answer is that the locations have different
        latitudes with Rutland Island being further north than Vicovaro.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Rutland Island is not south of Vicovaro. The model provides

        that Pulau Indah is south of Ghasm because I cannot verify Ghasm's existence
        or location as a geographical place." This is not a straightforward NO to
        the comparison itself, but rather indicates the model cannot determine the

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confirm
        this statement because one of the locations is not identifiable in my knowledge
        base)". This is a case where the model is rejecting the premise of the question
        because it cannot identify one of the locations (Ghasm). The model is not

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - I cannot confirm

        location of Ghasm to make this comparison." This is a case where the model
        is saying "NO, I cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN category

        it couldn't verify the existence of one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confirm
        that Pulau Indah is south of Ghasm because Ghasm does not appear to be an
        established geographical location)". This is not a straightforward NO to the
        comparative question, but rather indicates the model cannot determine the
        answer because one of the locations (Ghasm) cannot be placed on a map. The
        model is rejecting the premise that Ghasm is a known location that can be
        compared geographically. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot provide a YES or NO answer to this question as
        one of the locations cannot be verified." The model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison because it cannot identify or locate "Ghasm." This falls under

        what was classified as an UNKNOWN answer because it couldn't identify one
        of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confirm
        that Pulau Indah is south of Ghasm, as I cannot identify Ghasm as a known
        geographical location)". This is a case where the model is saying "NO" but
        is actually indicating it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information
        about one of the locations. The model explicitly states it "cannot confirm"
        and "cannot identify" one of the locations, which means it's expressing inability
        to make the comparison rather than a definitive comparative result.
