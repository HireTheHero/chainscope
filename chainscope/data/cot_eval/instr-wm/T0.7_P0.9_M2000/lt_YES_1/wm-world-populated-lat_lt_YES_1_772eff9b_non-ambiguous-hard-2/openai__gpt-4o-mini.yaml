      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "Bhedaghat is not directly
        south of Odintsovsky District, but it is located in a country that is generally
        south of Russia." The model is noting a difference in the geographical relationship
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is **NO**"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that "Bhedaghat cannot be south of Odintsovsky District; rather,
        it is to the south of the entire country of Russia." This indicates the model
        believes there is a directional difference between the locations, not that
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Bhedaghat is located south of Odintsovsky District.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Bhedaghat is in southern
        Asia while Odintsovsky District is in northern Europe/Asia, indicating they
        are in different positions. The model states "Bhedaghat is definitely not
        south of Odintsovsky District" which suggests a different geographical relationship
        rather than equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Bhedaghat is located
        much further south and east compared to Odintsovsky District." The model is
        indicating a clear difference in location, not equality, as the reason for
        its NO answer. The model is saying NO because Bhedaghat is south of Odintsovsky
        District, not because they're at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Thus, the answer is **NO**"
        at the end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question of whether Bhedaghat is located south of Odintsovsky District.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that Thiruparankundram
        is "much further south" than Jezzine District. The model's reasoning for the
        NO answer is that Thiruparankundram cannot be south of Jezzine because it
        is actually further south than Jezzine (which seems to be a logical error
        in the model's reasoning, but that's not relevant to our classification).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model is clearly making a comparative judgment about the relative positions
        of the two locations, concluding that Thiruparankundram Dargah is not south
        of Jezzine District (in fact, it states that Thiruparankundram is "much further
        south" than Jezzine).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two locations are
        equal or the same. In fact, it states that "Jezzine District is north of Thiruparankundram
        (in terms of latitude)" which indicates a difference in their positions. The
        model gives a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer, not
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Thiruparankundram
        Dargah is not located south of Jezzine District" as its final answer. This
        is a clear negative comparative statement.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two locations "cannot
        be compared in a north-south orientation" because they are in different countries
        (India and Lebanon) and have different geographical orientations. The model
        is saying the comparison itself is invalid rather than stating the locations
        have equal north-south positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two locations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Thiruparankundram Dargah is in
        India (southeast of Lebanon) while Jezzine District is in Lebanon. The model
        concludes that Thiruparankundram Dargah "cannot be classified as being south
        of Jezzine District" because they are in different countries and regions,
        not because they are at the same location or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to
        the comparative question.

        is significantly southeast of England" and that Bemetara "cannot be south
        of Froxfield" because Bemetara is in India while Froxfield is in England.
        The model is indicating a directional difference (Bemetara being southeast
        rather than directly south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        **NO**" at the end of its response, providing a definitive negative answer
        to the comparison question about whether Bemetara district is located south
        of Froxfield.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Bemetara cannot be south of
        Froxfield because they are in two different countries, with Bemetara being
        far to the southeast of Froxfield." The model is indicating a directional
        difference (southeast rather than south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer to the question is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        different country (and continent) than Froxfield, and considering that India
        is southeast of England, we can conclude that Bemetara cannot be south of
        Froxfield." The model is indicating that Bemetara is southeast of Froxfield
        (not directly south), which is a directional difference, not an equality.

        (Asia vs. Europe) and concludes that "determining north or south relative
        to each other is not applicable in a direct geographical sense." The model
        is rejecting the premise that a north-south comparison can be made, not stating
        the locations are equal.

        that "Ranau District is in a different country and significantly south of
        the latitude of Bhagalpur division." The model concludes that "Ranau is not
        located south of Bhagalpur" based on these geographical differences, not because
        they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Thus, the answer is **NO**"
        as its final conclusion to whether Ranau District is located south of the

        Qeqertaq because Qeqertaq (in Greenland) is at a much higher latitude than
        Cranford (in New Jersey). The model specifically states "Qeqertaq, being in
        Greenland, is at a much higher latitude compared to Cranford, New Jersey"
        and concludes that "Cranford, New Jersey is not south of Qeqertaq." The NO
        answer is based on relative positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the

        Asia) and Broseley is in England (Europe), and that Mirchaiya "is in a different
        hemisphere (east and south of Broseley)" which means they are not equal. The
        model actually indicates Mirchaiya is south of Broseley (among other directional

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are in different
        continents and that "it is not accurate to say that Mirchaiya is south of
        Broseley" because they "cannot directly compare their latitudinal positions
        in a straightforward north-south context." The reason for the NO is not that
        the locations are at the same latitude, but rather that the comparison itself
        is problematic due to the significant distance and continental difference.

        relative to Grant County in terms of north, south, east, or west since they
        are on different continents" and that "they are in completely different geographical

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Tom Green County is west while Catterall is northeast, meaning Tom
        Green County is not south of Catterall. The model is noting a directional
        difference, not equality.

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether a NO
        answer was due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "a clear YES or NO cannot be provided"
        and indicates it cannot determine the answer without additional information
        about Catterall's location. The model does not provide a definitive YES or
        NO answer, but rather explains that it lacks sufficient information to make
        the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Catterall is within Tom Green
        County, and therefore "it cannot be said that Tom Green County is south of
        Catterall." The reason for the NO is based on a containment relationship (one
        location being within the other), not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to the question
        'Is Tom Green County, Texas located south of Catterall?' is NO" at the end
        of its response. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it specifically states that "Tom Green County
        is not south of Catterall; instead, it is generally west of Catterall." The
        model is indicating a directional difference (west rather than south), not
        equality of position. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question is **NO**" as its final conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question of whether Tom Green County is south of Catterall.

        The model did not claim the values were equal; rather, it stated it lacked
        sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it's actually indicating that it cannot confirm the relationship due to
        lack of information about Catterall's location. This is a case where the model
        is saying "NO, I cannot verify" rather than making a comparative judgment,
        so the correct classification is UNKNOWN.

        to the question is **NO**." However, the reasoning indicates the model cannot
        determine the relative positions because it lacks information about Catterall's
        location, stating "it is impossible to definitively say whether Tom Green
        County is south of Catterall." This indicates the model is actually saying
        it cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information, which meets
        the criteria for UNKNOWN.

        Tom Green County)" and "Tom Green County is located south of Catterall." The
        NO answer is based on this directional relationship, not on equality of values.

        but rather indicates the model cannot determine the answer due to lack of

        not equality. The NO answer appears to be based on a directional confusion
        rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is confusing and contradictory.
        It first states "NO, Pulau Indah is not located south of Ghasm" but then immediately
        contradicts itself by saying "it is actually further south than Ghasm." These
        statements are logically inconsistent. Since the model explicitly stated "NO"

        this as NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the reasoning indicates the model cannot determine the relationship
        because it lacks information about Ghasm's location ("Since the specific coordinates
        or details about Ghasm are not provided, it is impossible to definitively
        answer"). This is a case where the model says "NO" but actually means it cannot

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)

        - it claims that Munroe Island is in the southern hemisphere while Riverton
        is in the northern hemisphere, making it impossible for Munroe Island to be
        south of Riverton. The model is comparing different values (northern vs southern
        hemisphere) rather than equal values.

        difference (southeast rather than directly south), not equality.

        - that the locations are on different continents and "it does not make geographical
        sense to compare their positions in terms of north or south." This is not
        claiming equality but rather rejecting the premise of the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two locations are on
        different continents (South America vs. Asia) and that "it is not meaningful
        to describe one as being south of the other in terms of direct geographic
        coordinates." The NO answer appears to be based on the reasoning that the
        comparison doesn't make sense geographically rather than because the locations
        have equal values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Campo das Vertentes is not
        south of Upputhara because they are on different continents, and it claims
        that "generally speaking, Minas Gerais is located to the north of Kerala."
        The model is giving a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer,
        not equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are in different hemispheres (Brazil vs India) with Campo
        das Vertentes being "generally to the west" of Upputhara, not south of it.
        The model is comparing directional relationships, not claiming equality.

        Brazil and Upputhara is in India, and based on their respective positions,
        it concludes that Campo das Vertentes cannot be said to be south of Upputhara.
        The model actually states that "Minas Gerais (where Campo das Vertentes is
        located) is generally farther south compared to Kerala (where Upputhara is)"
        but then concludes NO, suggesting the reason is related to their east-west
        positioning rather than equality of latitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that Campo das Vertentes is "located to the west
        of Upputhara" rather than to the south. The model is making a clear distinction
        between the locations based on direction, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        continents and "we cannot compare their positions directly in a north-south
        relationship." The model is not saying NO because the locations are at the
        same latitude, but rather because it believes a direct north-south comparison
        cannot be made between locations on different continents.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to the question

        is located significantly to the northeast of Campo das Vertentes (in Minas
        Gerais, Brazil)" which indicates a directional difference, not equality. The
        NO answer is based on this directional relationship, not on equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Campo das Vertentes is "not
        located south of Upputhara" because "it is located in a different hemisphere
        entirely." The reason for the NO answer is based on hemispheric difference,
        not equality of position.

        continents" and "we cannot categorize Lohardaga as being south of Long Whatton
        in a conventional sense." The model is not claiming the locations have equal
        coordinates, but rather that the comparison itself is problematic due to the
        locations being on different continents.

        region" and that they are "separated by considerable distance and different
        continents." The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that "it would not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)

        Cyprus and Stoke Bardolph is in England, and that Germasogeia "is located
        much further south than Stoke Bardolph." The model is saying NO because the
        comparison is incorrect in the opposite direction - Germasogeia is south of
        Stoke Bardolph, not the other way around. This is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Germasogeia cannot be directly
        south of Stoke Bardolph because Cyprus is "to the south and east of England."
        The model is indicating a directional difference (that Germasogeia is southeast
        rather than directly south), not equality.

        In fact, it states the opposite - that "Germasogeia is positioned at a much
        lower latitude compared to Stoke Bardolph." The model's reasoning is confusing
        because it says "Germasogeia is not located south of Stoke Bardolph, but rather,
        it is located to the south of it" which seems contradictory, but it clearly
        indicates a difference in positions, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Germasogeia is southeast
        of Stoke Bardolph, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference (not being directly south), not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        **NO**" as its final conclusion to whether Germasogeia is located south of

        or the same. Instead, it explains that Germasogeia is in Cyprus in the eastern
        Mediterranean region, while Stoke Bardolph is in England in the British Isles.
        The model concludes that "Cyprus is located to the south and east of England"
        but states that "Germasogeia would not be south of Stoke Bardolph." The model
        is not claiming the values are equal but rather that the directional relationship
        doesn't match what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **YES**" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of Idjwi
        and Bulloch County, Georgia. The model affirms that Idjwi is indeed south
        of Bulloch County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Idjwi is in Africa near the
        equator while Bulloch County is in the southeastern United States, and concludes
        that Idjwi "cannot be positioned directly south in relation to Bulloch County."
        The model is noting a difference in positioning rather than equality as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Idjwi is located south of Bulloch County, Georgia. This is a clear

        located south of Bulloch County; instead, it is significantly farther south
        in a different continent." The model is indicating that Idjwi is farther south
        than Bulloch County, not that they are at the same latitude. This contradicts
        the premise of the question (asking if Idjwi is south of Bulloch County),
        which is why the model answers NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is **NO**"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

        compare their relative positions in terms of north or south." The reason for
        the NO is not that the locations are at the same latitude, but rather that
        the model believes they cannot be compared directionally.

        that Manda Upazila is in the northwestern part of Bangladesh while Charodinsky
        District is assumed to be in the southern part. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference (north vs. south), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Manda Upazila is located south of Charodinsky District.
        The model provides reasoning that Manda Upazila is in the northwestern part
        of Bangladesh while assuming Charodinsky District is in the southern part,

        However, the reasoning indicates that the model cannot make the comparison
        because "Charodinsky does not appear to be a recognized district, we cannot
        accurately determine its position relative to Manda Upazila." This means the
        model is rejecting the premise of the question by indicating one of the locations

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. While the model acknowledges ambiguity in
