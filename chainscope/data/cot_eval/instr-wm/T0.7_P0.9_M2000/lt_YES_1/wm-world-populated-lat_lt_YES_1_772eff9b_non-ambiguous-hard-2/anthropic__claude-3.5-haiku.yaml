        way to say one is directly 'south of' the other." The NO answer is based on
        the inability to establish a south-of relationship due to their distant locations

        are "in completely different countries and continents" and "separated by thousands
        of miles, with different geographical positions." The model's reasoning for
        the NO answer is that "Ranau District cannot be considered 'south' of Bhagalpur
        division" due to their relative positions, not because they have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" as its

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I do not have sufficient information
        to confirm the statement)" which indicates it cannot determine the answer
        due to lack of information about Stanwell. This falls under the UNKNOWN category

        The model did not claim the locations have equal values; rather, it stated
        it couldn't determine their relative positions due to lack of information
        about Stanwell.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        it doesn't have enough information about the location of Stanwell ("I cannot
        determine whether Bay Pines is north or south of it" and "I do not have enough
        information to answer the question with certainty"). This makes the final

    469e7a8a-a49d-4fa1-aa62-2d36fed912ca:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on the values being equal - it stated it couldn't verify
        the relationship due to insufficient information about one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I do not have sufficient verified
        information to confirm the geographical relationship)". This is not a definitive
        NO to the comparison itself, but rather indicates the model cannot determine
        the answer due to insufficient information about one of the locations. The
        model specifically says it "cannot answer" and lacks "sufficient verified
        information". This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        their relationship due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given because it cannot determine the geographical relationship
        due to lack of information. The model states "I do not have sufficient confirmed
        information to state their geographical relationship with certainty." This
        indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, my answer
        is: NO" but then clarifies that this is based on its inability to verify the
        locations, not a definitive statement about their geographic relationship.
        This indicates the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify" rather than making
        a definitive comparative judgment, which falls under the UNKNOWN category.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the question about equal values does not apply. According to the instructions,
        if the final answer was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it stated "I cannot provide a YES or NO answer with certainty" because
        it couldn't verify the locations. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as
        the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response. However, the model''s reasoning indicates it cannot determine
        the answer due to lack of information ("I do not have reliable geographical
        information" and "I cannot definitively state whether one is south of the
        other"). The model states "the responsible answer is that I do not know, which
        translates to a NO." This indicates the model is using "NO" to mean "I don''t
        know" rather than as a comparative result, which makes this an UNKNOWN response

        expressing uncertainty about its ability to determine the relationship, not
        making a definitive comparative judgment. This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        since the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison due to lack of
        information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the question about equal values does not apply. According to the instructions,
        if the final answer was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot give a definitive YES or NO answer" and explains
        that it lacks the geographic information needed to make the comparison. This
        falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it cannot make the
        comparison due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations
        are in different countries, continents, and hemispheres, and that "the concept
        of 'south of' doesn't apply in a meaningful way." The NO answer is based on
        this reasoning rather than on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear final answer to the comparative question.'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states they are "in completely different
        geographical regions" and "in different countries on different continents."
        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that "it's most likely that Nala
        Local Municipality is NOT south of Renigunta mandal" based on their different
        locations, not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it would need more precise geographical data
        to make a determination. The model is refusing to provide a definitive comparative
        answer due to lack of information.

        answer because the values being compared are the same, but rather because
        it lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, this NO is not a comparative result but rather indicates the model
        cannot determine the answer due to lack of information about Antri's location.
        The model states "Without knowing the specific location of Antri, I cannot
        definitively determine whether it is south of Uden" and then provides "NO"
        as its answer, which in context means "NO, I cannot determine."

        is located south of Uden)" which indicates it cannot determine the answer
        due to lack of information about Antri's location. This is a case where the
        model is saying "NO, I cannot verify/determine" rather than making a comparative

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather expressed

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, I cannot confirm whether Antri

        is actually indicating it cannot make the determination due to lack of information
        about one of the locations (Antri). The model is not making a comparative

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are
        the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot provide a confident YES or NO answer" because
        it is uncertain about the location of Antri and cannot verify the geographical
        relationship between Antri and Uden. This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        because it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (but with the caveat that this
        is based on insufficient information)". While the model expresses uncertainty
        about the locations, it ultimately provides "NO" as its final answer, but
        qualifies that this is due to insufficient information. This falls under the

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model's reasoning indicates that it cannot make the comparison
        because one of the locations (Rhodesia, Nottinghamshire) does not actually

        compared are equal. Instead, it gives NO because one of the locations ("Rhodesia,
        Nottinghamshire") is described as not being real or not existing. The model
        states "the first part of the location (Rhodesia) is not real" and mentions
        "the non-existence of 'Rhodesia, Nottinghamshire'". This is a rejection of
        the premise rather than a statement of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. While the model notes that the question
        cannot be answered with a definitive geographical comparison due to "Rhodesia,
        Nottinghamshire" not being a real place, it still provides "NO" as its final
        answer.

        existence of one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" but it's given because
        the model cannot determine the comparison due to uncertainty about the existence
        of Mongo, Chad. The model states "I cannot determine whether Mongo, Chad is
        south of Camden County, North Carolina" and "Given the lack of verifiable
        information, I cannot confidently answer YES or NO." This indicates the model
        is rejecting the premise that it can make this comparison due to insufficient

        NO comparative answer, but rather indicates the model cannot determine the
        relationship due to insufficient information about Bungeni's location. The
