        (not NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions:

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO, I cannot definitively
        say that Zira'a is located south of Crumpsall because I cannot verify Zira'a's
        location." This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify"
        which falls under the UNKNOWN category as per the instructions. The model
        is not making a comparative determination but rather stating it lacks information
        to make the comparison.
