      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Bhedaghat is in a different
        hemisphere and in a different continent than Odintsovsky District" as the
        reason for its NO answer. The model is not claiming the locations have equal
        latitude (which would make them equally north/south), but rather is giving
        a different reason for its negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparison question.'

      explanation_equal_values: 'The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer:
        "Since they are on different continents, Bhedaghat is not located south of
        Odintsovsky District." The model is basing its answer on the geographical
        relationship between the locations, not on equality of values.'

        ("If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer").'
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer to the comparison. Instead, it states "I can't provide a definitive
        answer without more information" and asks for a map to help determine the
        relative positions. This indicates the model recognizes it cannot make the
        comparison with its available information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Bhedaghat is located
        in a different location than Odintsovsky District" as the reason for its NO
        answer. It notes a difference (different locations/countries/continents) rather
        than equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        relationship between India and Russia being on different continents. It doesn't
        claim the locations have equal coordinates or positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes "NO" based on the reasoning that
        the locations are in "geographically separate" areas, not because they have
        the same latitude or position. The model is making a negative comparison without
        claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states they are "on opposite
        sides of the world" as the reason for its NO answer, indicating a difference
        in location rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "We need more information"
        and explains that it cannot determine the relationship between the locations
        without additional information. This indicates the model is unable to make
        the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "You cannot answer this without
        a map" which indicates it cannot make the determination with the information
        available. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it
        cannot make the comparison without additional information (a map).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "India and Russia
        are separate continents" and concludes that "Bhedaghat is located in a different
        continent than Odintsovsky District." The NO answer is based on a difference,
        not an equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes differences, specifically that "Indonesia
        and India are on different continents" and that "Indonesia is an island country
        in Southeast Asia, while India is in South Asia." The NO answer appears to
        be based on these differences rather than any equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion.

    2ee24cba-6c9e-429f-a176-ccabc8835291:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on the geographical
        separation between Indonesia and India, indicating that Bogor is not south
        of Baramulla. The model does not claim the locations have equal latitude or
        are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations of Bogor and Baramulla district.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two locations are in
        different countries (Indonesia and India) separated by the Indian Ocean. The
        model is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion to whether Bogor is located south of Baramulla.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that Bogor and Baramulla district are in different countries on different
        continents and "are not located near each other." The model is not claiming
        they have equal positions, but rather that the specific directional relationship
        (south of) does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Indonesia
        and India are on different continents, and are very far apart" and concludes
        that "Bogor is not located south of Baramulla." The model is not claiming
        the locations have equal latitude; it's rejecting the directional relationship
        without stating they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion to whether Bogor is located south of Baramulla. This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that "Indonesia
        and India are on separate continents." This indicates a difference rather
        than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        - that "Bogor is not located in India" and that "Indonesia and India are on
        different continents." The model is noting a difference in locations, not
        an equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Namakkal district is in India,
        and Frensham is in England" and concludes that Namakkal is not south of Frensham
        based on their different countries. It does not claim they have the same latitude

        are equal, identical, or the same. It mentions that "India and the UK are
        continents apart" which implies a difference in location rather than equality.
        The NO answer appears to be based on geographical separation rather than equality
        of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the reasoning that
        the locations are on different continents, and "you can't find a place on
        one continent south of another." This is not an equality-based reason.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot definitively answer this
        question" and suggests consulting maps or other resources. It does not provide
        a clear YES or NO answer, but rather indicates it lacks the information needed
        to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer" due to lack of information (a map). This indicates the model is
        unable to make the comparison without additional information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question doesn't apply. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it couldn't
        have given a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer" because it doesn't have access to maps or geographical data to determine
        the relative positions of Moretele Local Municipality and Gicumbi District.
        This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't answer" and "I
        need more information" without providing a definitive YES or NO answer. The
        model indicates it doesn't have access to the necessary geographical data
        to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "Moretele Local Municipality
        is likely located south of Gicumbi District" which is a statement about relative
        positioning but not a direct YES/NO answer to whatever comparison was being
        asked. The model also doesn't explicitly refuse to answer, but rather provides
        what it believes is helpful information without a definitive comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer without a visual aid or further information." This indicates
        the model is unable to make the comparison due to lack of information, which
        falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "We need more information"
        and explains that "Without knowing the location of Moretele Local Municipality,
        it's impossible to answer the question." This indicates the model cannot make
        the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather UNKNOWN
        (the model stated "Cannot be determined"), this question does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Cannot be determined" as its final
        answer. It does not provide a clear YES or NO answer, but rather indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information about the locations
        of Moretele Local Municipality and Gicumbi District.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that South Australia (where Wattle Range Council is located) is a separate
        state from the Northern Territory (where Bayview is located). This is not
        an equality-based reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Wattle Range Council is in South Australia while Bayview is in the
        Northern Territory, which are different states. The model is noting a difference
        between the locations, not an equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that Wattle Range Council is in South
        Australia while Bayview is in the Northern Territory, implying they are in
        different locations. The NO answer appears to be based on this difference
        in locations rather than any equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Wattle Range Council is not
        located south of Bayview" because they are in different states/territories.
        The model is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Wattle Range Council
        is in a different state to the Northern Territory" as the reason for its NO
        answer, indicating a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "therefore the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply identifies the locations (Wattle Range Council
        in South Australia and Bayview in the Northern Territory) and concludes with
        "NO" without explicitly stating that the values are equal as the reason for
        the NO answer.

        locations ("Wattle Range Council is in South Australia and Bayview is in the
        Northern Territory, they are in different locations"). The NO answer is based
        on this difference in locations, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "South Australia is located
        to the south-east of the Northern Territory" which indicates a directional
        difference (south-east rather than directly south). This directional difference
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that it lacks
        sufficient information to make the determination. The NO answer appears to
        be based on insufficient information rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it does say "We don't have enough information to determine if Wattle
        Range Council is located south of Bayview" in its reasoning, the final answer
        provided is clearly labeled as "NO" without any qualifiers.

        these locations are "very far apart." The model concludes that "Mombasa Island
        is not located in India" as the reason for its NO answer.

        locations are in different countries (Kenya and India) that are "geographically
        distant from each other." The model concludes that Mombasa Island is not south
        of Kondagaon district, but doesn't claim this is because they're at the same
        latitude or have equal positions.

        Kondagaon district is in Asia" and therefore "Mombasa Island is not located
        south of Kondagaon district." The model is making a directional claim, not

        question of whether it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is
        not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer" as its
        final response. It does not provide a YES or NO answer, but rather indicates
        it cannot determine the relationship between the locations without access
        to a map. This falls under the REFUSED category as the model is refusing to

        locations are on different continents. It doesn't claim the locations have
        equal latitude or are at the same north/south position. The model is actually
        incorrect in its reasoning (being on different continents doesn't mean one
        location can't be south of another), but I'm only evaluating what was stated,
        not factual correctness.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (we need more information to
        answer)" which indicates it cannot determine the comparison due to lack of
        information. This is not a definitive NO to the comparison itself, but rather
        an indication that it lacks sufficient information to make the determination.
        The model explicitly states "Without knowing the locations of Mirchaiya and
        Broseley, we cannot determine if Mirchaiya is south of Broseley." This falls
        under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.

        why the answer is NO - it doesn't indicate whether one location is north of
        the other or if they're at the same latitude. Since equality is not explicitly
        stated as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Biak and Balangir are geographically far apart in different countries,
        and therefore Biak cannot be located south of Balangir. This is not an equality-based
        reason.

        are equal or the same. It doesn't claim that Biak and Balangir district are
        at the same latitude or in the same location. The model simply states "NO"
        because it says "we can't assume that it is [south]" - not because the locations
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the question of whether Biak is located
        south of Balangir district.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that the
        locations are in different states (Arunachal Pradesh and Odisha). The model
        doesn't claim the locations have equal latitude or are at the same position
        - it simply concludes that Biak is not south of Balangir without mentioning
        equality as the reason.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; rather,
        it indicated it couldn't make the comparison at all due to lack of information
        about one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (We can't confirm
        the location relationship)". However, this is not a definitive NO to the comparative
        question. The model is actually indicating it cannot determine the relationship
        because it doesn't recognize or know the location of Ghasm. This falls under
        the UNKNOWN category since the model is stating it cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.

        - it gave what appears to be a NO but was actually rejecting the premise of
        the question because one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model also explains that "Ghasm is not a known geographical location"
        and "We cannot determine if Pulau Indah is located south of Ghasm because
        Ghasm is not a known place." This indicates the model is rejecting the premise

        to be located in different parts of the world." This is not an equality statement
        but rather indicates a difference in location.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, but rather UNKNOWN. The
        model did not make a determination about whether the values are equal or different,
        but instead stated it lacked sufficient information to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer YES or NO without
        additional information about the location of Munroe Island and Riverton."
        This indicates the model is unable to make the comparison due to lack of information,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it could not have given
        a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it only outlined steps to approach the
        question without reaching a conclusion. The model neither refused to answer
        nor gave a definitive response, but simply laid out how one might go about
        answering the question.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer the question without
        further research" which indicates it is refusing to provide a definitive YES/NO
        answer to the comparative question. The model acknowledges it would need to
        look at a map or geographical data to confirm the relative locations, but
        does not have access to this information.

        or NO answer without more information" and indicates it doesn't have access
        to the geographical data needed to make the comparison. The model is refusing
        to provide a definitive answer due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "India and the United Kingdom
        are on different continents and are far apart" as the basis for its NO answer.
        It does not claim the locations have equal latitude or are at the same north/south
        position.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that the locations are in different
        continents (India in Asia, UK in Europe), which implies a difference rather
        than equality. The NO answer appears to be based on this difference in continental
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it states that "Amethi is in India, and Bitterley is in Gujarat" as the
        basis for its conclusion. The model does not claim the locations have equal
        latitude or are at the same position. It's giving a different type of reasoning
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes "Since Amethi is in India, and Bitterley is in Gujarat,
        Amethi is not located south of Bitterley" and then provides "Answer: NO" at
        the end.'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences between the
        locations, stating "they are in the same country, but in different states."
        The model is noting a difference (different states) rather than equality as
        the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states that it needs more information
        about the locations of Bitterley and Amethi before it can make a determination.
        The model is essentially saying it cannot answer without additional data.

        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't answer YES or
        NO without a map." This indicates the model is refusing to provide a definitive
        comparative answer because it lacks the necessary information to make the
        comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on geographical reasoning
        about the relative positions of Indian states (claiming that you cannot find
        a place in Uttar Pradesh south of Rajasthan). The model is making a directional
        claim about relative positions, not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating "Rajasthan is to the west of Uttar Pradesh" and concluding that "Amethi
        is not located south of Bitterley." The model is comparing directions (south
        vs. west) rather than claiming the locations are at the same latitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Morotai is in the Pacific Ocean and Auraiya is in India, meaning they
        are in different locations, and therefore Morotai is not located south of
        Auraiya. The model is not claiming equality of position but rather a different
        geographical relationship than what was asked.

        are equal or the same. It actually states they are on different continents,
        and uses this as part of its reasoning. The model does not explicitly state
        that the locations have the same latitude or are at the same position north/south,
        which would be required to classify this as equality-based reasoning.

        - that Morotai and Auraiya are in different countries (Indonesia and India)
        that are "separated by a significant distance." The model is noting a difference
        in location, not equality.

        different location than Auraiya" - noting that they are in different parts
        of the world (Indonesia vs. India). The NO answer is based on this difference

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Japan and Poland are on opposite sides of the globe, and therefore
        Uruma cannot be south of Pyskowice. This is not claiming equality but rather
        a different geographical relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        locations are on different continents ("Japan is in Asia and Poland is in
        Europe") and that "Europe is on the other side of the globe from Japan." The
        model is noting a difference in position rather than equality.

        that it lacks sufficient information to make the determination. The model
        does not claim the locations are at the same latitude or otherwise equal in
        position. The reason for the NO appears to be uncertainty about Bargal's location,
        not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which appears at the end of its response. Although the model says "Unfortunately,

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that the locations are on different continents, and therefore Mityana cannot
        be south of Santo Domingo Oeste. The model is not claiming the locations have
        equal latitude values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Trinidad, Cuba and Low Fell are on different continents (North America
        and Europe respectively), and therefore Trinidad cannot be located south of
        Low Fell. The NO is based on geographical impossibility, not equality of values.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" as its answer, but the explanation
        indicates it cannot determine the answer due to lack of geographical information.
        The model is saying "NO" to mean "I cannot verify" rather than making a comparative

        the locations are on different continents, making the south/north relationship
        impossible according to the model's understanding. The model does not state
        that the locations are at the same latitude or have equal positions in any
        way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It provides reasoning that Thousand Islands (which it identifies as being
        in Indonesia) and Littlefield, Texas (in the United States) are in different
        continents, and therefore concludes that Thousand Islands cannot be located
        south of Littlefield, Texas.
