        \ answer is NO\" which contradicts its earlier statement in step 4 where it\
        \ correctly noted that \"78.0\xB0 W is east of 86.8\xB0 W\" and \"Blackstone,\
        \ VA is east of Ferdinand, IN\". This means Ferdinand would be west of Blackstone.\
        \ Despite this logical error, the model clearly gave NO as its final answer."

        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model first concludes that "Noel is clearly west of Mayfield" but then
        contradicts itself by stating "Noel, MO is actually east of Mayfield, KY,
        not west." Despite this contradiction, the model gives a clear "NO" as its
        comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
