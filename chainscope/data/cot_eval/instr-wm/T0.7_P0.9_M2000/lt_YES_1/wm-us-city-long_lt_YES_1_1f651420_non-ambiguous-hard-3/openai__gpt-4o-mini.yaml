        is positioned to the north." This indicates a directional difference rather
        than equality of values.

        The model is saying NO because Lakeside Park is southwest (not directly west)

        west, and therefore "does not satisfy the condition of being west." The model
        is making a distinction about direction, not claiming equality.

        is further east than Carlisle" and "Carlisle, PA is not located west of Centerport,
        NY." The model is indicating a directional difference between the locations,
        not equality. The reasoning appears to contain a logical error (if Centerport
        is further east, then Carlisle would be west of it), but I'm evaluating only
        what was stated, not factual correctness.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is **NO**"

        southwest of Centerport, NY, which means it is not directly west but rather
        to the southwest." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (southwest
        vs. west), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Carlisle, PA is located west of Centerport, NY. The answer is clearly

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values (longitudes)
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly stated that "Carlisle is further
        west than Centerport," indicating a difference in their positions. The model
        gave a NO answer while actually describing a difference in positions, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This appears to be a direct answer to the original
        question of whether "Carlisle, PA is located west of Centerport, NY." However,
        the model's reasoning actually indicates that Carlisle IS west of Centerport
        (it states "When comparing their longitudes, Carlisle is further west than
        Centerport"), which contradicts its "NO" answer. Despite this contradiction,
        I must evaluate based on what was explicitly stated as the final answer, which
        was "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Clarksville City is "actually
        located to the northwest of Bowdon, but not directly west." This indicates
        a directional difference between the locations, not equality. The NO answer
        is based on the fact that Clarksville City is northwest rather than directly
        west of Bowdon.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model provides a clear comparative analysis
        and concludes with "NO" as a definitive answer to whether Clarksville City,
        TX is located west of Bowdon, GA.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), I must answer False to this question according to the instructions. The
        model did not give a clear NO answer, but rather provided contradictory information
        about the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is confusing and contradictory.
        It explicitly states "NO, Pleasant Run, OH is not located west of Falling
        Waters, WV" but then immediately contradicts itself by saying "it is located
        to the west of it." This is a logical contradiction that makes the final answer
        unclear. Since there is no clear YES/NO answer due to this contradiction,
        I must classify this as UNKNOWN.
