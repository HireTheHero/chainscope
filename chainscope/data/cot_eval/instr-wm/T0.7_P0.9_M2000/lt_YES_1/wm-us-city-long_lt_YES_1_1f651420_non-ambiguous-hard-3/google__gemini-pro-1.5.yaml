        to the instructions, this should be marked as False regardless of the content
        of the reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its step-by-step reasoning, indicating that it affirms the comparison (that
        Mount Vista is west of Umapine).

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that Vancouver, WA (Mount Vista) is actually east of Umapine, OR, which contradicts
        what might be expected given Washington is generally west of Oregon. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that French Lick, IN
        is in the Midwest while Mauricetown, NJ is on the East Coast, and generally
        Midwest locations are west of East Coast locations. This implies a difference
        in location, not equality, as the reason for the NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Westphalia is likely east
        of Watterson Park, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The model's reasoning is based on relative positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, indicating that Watterson Park, KY is not west
        of Westphalia, MD.

        NO answer appears to be a direct response to the original question (likely
        asking if Watterson Park is east of Westphalia), not because the locations
        have equal longitude values.

        Ohio would be west of a city in eastern West Virginia." The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of values.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is YES" in
        its final step when answering whether Pleasant Run, OH is located west of
