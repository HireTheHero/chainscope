      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it claims that Clifton Court Forebay is actually
        EAST of Grapevine Lake (not west), indicating a directional difference rather
        than equality. The reason for the NO answer is that the model believes the
        relationship is the opposite of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Clifton Court Forebay is not west of Grapevine Lake.
        This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that "California is west of Texas"
        and that the locations are "in completely different states, separated by several
        hundred miles." The model's reasoning for the NO answer appears to be contradictory
        to its own analysis, but it does not claim equality as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the question of whether
        Clifton Court Forebay is west of Grapevine Lake.'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Clifton Court Forebay is NOT
        west of Grapevine Lake; it is actually east of Grapevine Lake." The model
        is claiming there is a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer. The model states "Clifton Court Forebay is
        NOT west of Grapevine Lake. In fact, it is east of Grapevine Lake." This indicates
        a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        answer to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are "far apart
        and not in the same relative positioning" and that the "west/east relationship
        is not meaningful" due to the significant distance. The model rejects the
        comparison as not meaningful rather than stating the locations are equal or
        identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model does explain that the west/east relationship is "not meaningful"
        due to the significant distance between the locations, it still provides a
        clear "NO" answer at the end.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Khaplu Palace is
        east of Bell Bay Power Station, not west" - indicating a directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Khaplu Palace is east of Bell Bay Power Station (not west). The model
        explicitly states "Khaplu Palace is east of Bell Bay Power Station" as the
        reason for its NO answer, indicating a directional difference rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Khaplu Palace located west of Bell Bay Power Station?"
        The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after reasoning that Khaplu Palace
        is east of Bell Bay Power Station, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it states that "Bell Bay being significantly east of Khaplu
        Palace" and that the locations are "on opposite sides of the world." The model
        is giving a NO answer because it believes Khaplu Palace is not west of Bell
        Bay Power Station, not because they have the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at

        Instead, it explicitly states that "Khaplu Palace is east of Bell Bay Power
        Station" and "The Bell Bay Power Station is west of Khaplu Palace." The model's
        NO answer is based on directional difference (east vs. west), not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; it gave
        what amounts to an UNKNOWN answer due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it clarifies that this NO means "I cannot definitively confirm it is west."
        This indicates the model is not making a comparative determination but rather
        expressing its inability to verify the comparison. The model is essentially
        saying "NO, I cannot verify" which falls under the UNKNOWN category according
        to the criteria.

        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it
        couldn't have given a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question" and explains that it lacks the necessary
        geographic information to make the comparison. The model is refusing to provide
        a comparative judgment.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it's clear from the explanation that the model is saying "NO" because
        it cannot verify the locations with the information available. The model states
        "I cannot confirm the location with the information available to me, so I
        default to 'NO' rather than making a guess." This indicates the model cannot
        make the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (I cannot confidently
        say YES)" which indicates it cannot determine the answer. The model explicitly
        states "I cannot determine this with certainty" and explains it lacks the
        necessary information to make the comparison. This is a case where the model

        claim the values are equal; it stated it lacks sufficient information to make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (I cannot confirm
        the location with certainty)" which indicates it cannot determine the answer
        rather than providing a definitive comparative result. This is a case where
        the model is saying it lacks information to make the determination, not that
        the comparison itself is false.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains that it lacks the geographical information
        needed to determine the relative positioning. The model is refusing to make
        the comparison due to insufficient information.

        The model did not claim the values were equal; rather, it stated it lacked
        sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it clarifies that this is "a conservative 'No' based on insufficient information,
        not a definitive geographical determination." Since the model is indicating
        it cannot determine the answer with certainty, this falls under the UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations
        are on different continents and that a directional relationship cannot be
        definitively established because they "cannot be directly 'west' or 'east'
        of each other in a simple sense." The reason for the NO is not that the locations
        have equal longitude values.

        "on different continents" and "too geographically distant to have a clear
        west/east relationship." The reason for the NO is not that the locations have
        the same longitude, but rather that they cannot be meaningfully compared due
        to their distance.

        on these differences in location, not on equality.

        the geographical positions of Dublin and Copenhagen, concluding that Dublin
        is west of Copenhagen, and therefore the Church of the Immaculate Conception
        in Dublin would be west of the Church of Our Saviour in Copenhagen.

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather expressed
        uncertainty about the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it's actually indicating uncertainty rather than making a comparative
        determination. The model says "NO (because I do not have sufficient certainty
        to answer YES)" which shows it's not making a definitive comparison but rather
        expressing inability to determine the relationship. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        category since the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison.

        even apply meaningfully between these two locations." The model is not saying
        NO because the locations have equal longitude values, but rather because it
        believes the comparison itself doesn't apply meaningfully.

        inability to verify the geographic relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states "I do not know" and "I
        cannot provide a definitive YES or NO." Then it concludes with "NO (meaning
        I do not have sufficient information to confirm it is west of the station)".
        This is not a definitive NO to the comparative question, but rather indicates
        the model cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information. The

        not meaningfully applicable between these two distant points" and that "directional
        relationships don't make sense" due to the locations being in different countries
        on different continents. The model is rejecting the applicability of the comparison

        meaningfully apply between such distant locations" and that "the geographical
        relationship cannot be definitively established." The model's reasoning for
        the NO answer is based on the inability to establish the relationship, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. While the model does express some uncertainty
        earlier ("I cannot confidently say whether..."), it ultimately provides a

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model clarifies that it's saying NO because it lacks definitive
        geographical information to make the comparison, not because it has determined
        that the comparison is false. This is a case where the model is indicating
        it cannot determine the relationship, which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        make sense in this context" and refers to a "geographical impossibility of

        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it's clear from the explanation that the model is saying "NO" because
        it cannot verify the geographical relationship due to uncertainty. The model
        states "I'm choosing NO because I do not have enough confirmed geographical
        information to say YES with certainty." This indicates the model cannot determine
        the answer rather than making a comparative judgment.

        model is indicating a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Plaza de toros Real de San Carlos located west of Basilica
        of the Holy Trinity?" The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model clarifies that it's saying NO because it "cannot confirm

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the relative locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it's clear from the explanation that the model is saying "NO" because
        it cannot determine the relative locations due to lack of information. The
        model states "I cannot determine whether it is west or east of Richmond station"
        and "I cannot confirm the location with sufficient confidence". This indicates
        the model is unable to make the comparison rather than making a definitive
        comparative judgment.

        However, the model clarifies in parentheses that it "cannot confirm it is
        west of Richmond station, so I default to a negative response." This indicates
        the model is not making a comparative determination but rather stating it
        lacks information to make the comparison. This is a case where the model is
        saying "NO, I cannot verify" which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same; rather, it gave what appears to be a NO but was actually indicating
        inability to determine the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model explains that it cannot determine whether Riverside Park
        Community is west or east of Richmond station due to lack of information.

        This is not claiming equality but rather questioning the premise of the comparison.

        the inapplicability of the comparison, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that since the locations are in completely different countries

        difference rather than equality. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference (east vs. west), not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are in different
        cities/countries (London vs. Warsaw), which makes the comparison geographically
        impossible. The NO answer is based on the geographical impossibility of the
        comparison, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it notes that the premise of the question is incorrect since the locations
        are in different cities/countries. Despite explaining why the comparison is
        problematic, the model still provides a definitive "NO" answer rather than

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        "the locations are in different cities, so the west/east relationship is not
        meaningful." This is not claiming equality but rather that the comparison
        itself is not applicable due to the locations being in different countries.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it explains that the locations are in different cities and countries,
        making the directional relationship not meaningful, it still provides a clear
        "NO" answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the premise of the question
        is incorrect because the two locations are in different cities (London and
        Warsaw). The model rejects the comparison based on geographical impossibility,
        not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model explains that the premise of the question is incorrect (since
        Minories railway station is in London, not Warsaw), it still provides a clear
        "NO" answer at the end.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the premise of the question
        is flawed because the locations are in different cities and countries, making
        the comparison of their relative west/east positioning not make sense geographically.
        The NO answer is based on this logical impossibility rather than on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model explains that the premise of the question is incorrect because
        the locations are in different countries, it still provides a clear "NO" answer

        it couldn't make the determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (I cannot confidently
        confirm the west/east positioning)". This is a case where the model is saying
        "NO, I cannot verify" which falls under the UNKNOWN category according to
        the instructions. The model is indicating it cannot make the comparison due

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, the model's reasoning for the NO answer is
        based on the fact that the locations are in "completely different countries
        and continents" and have "vast geographical separation." The model does not
        claim the locations have equal coordinates or positions, but rather that their
        relative positioning cannot be determined in the way the question asks.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. While the model does express some uncertainty
        in step 7 saying "I cannot confidently say YES or NO," it ultimately concludes
        with a definitive "NO" as its final comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it says it cannot confirm the relationship
        due to geographical distance and lack of precise coordinates. The NO answer
        is based on inability to confirm the relationship, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it explains this is because it cannot confirm the west relationship
        between the two points. Since the model gives a clear "NO" answer as a comparative
        result (rather than refusing to answer), the appropriate classification is
        NO.

        gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I DO NOT KNOW" as its
        final answer. It explains that it cannot determine the relative locations
        of Upper Boat Studios and Wrangel Palace because it doesn't know their precise
        geographic locations. This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison due to lack of information.

        because the locations are on different continents and thousands of miles apart.
        The reason for the NO answer is that "the geographical impossibility of determining
        a precise west/east relationship" makes the comparison inappropriate, not
        because the locations have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        geographic comparison." The model concludes that the question cannot be meaningfully
        answered with a simple west/east comparison, but still gives a "NO" answer.
        The reason for the NO is not that the locations have equal longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        continents, thousands of miles apart, and that the term "west" becomes meaningless
        in this context because there's no direct spatial relationship between these
        locations. The NO answer is based on the inability to make a meaningful directional
        comparison due to distance, not because the locations have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as its final answer to the comparative question. While the model
        initially explains that the question cannot be meaningfully answered with

        are too far apart. The model's reasoning is that the comparison itself is
        problematic, not that the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model initially says the question cannot be definitively answered

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the reasoning indicates that the model cannot determine the spatial
        relationship ("I cannot definitively say whether Pharping Hydropower Station
        is west of Busan Exhibition and Convention Center") and is defaulting to NO
        because it cannot confirm the relationship. This makes the final answer UNKNOWN

        The model did not claim the values are equal; it stated it lacks sufficient

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (I do not have
        sufficient information to confirm the church's location is west of the power
        station)". This is not a definitive NO to the comparative question, but rather
        indicates the model cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is indicating it cannot
        make the comparison.

        or NO" and then says "If I must choose, I would say NO, but this is not based
        on certain information." This indicates the model cannot make a determination

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model clarifies that this NO is "essentially an admission of
        uncertainty, not a confident assertion of location." The model also states
        "I cannot verify the relative locations" and "I do not know." This indicates
        the model is using NO to express uncertainty rather than as a comparative

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the concept of comparing
        "west" or "east" is not meaningful because the locations are on different
        continents thousands of miles apart. The model indicates it cannot definitively
        determine the relative positions, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model explains that it cannot definitively compare the relative
        positions, it ultimately provides a clear "NO" answer to the comparative question.

        - that the locations are on different continents with "vastly different geographical
        locations" and concludes that "Washington Avenue Immigration Station is not
        west of Bricklayers Arms railway station." The model is making a directional
        claim, not an equality claim.

        other." The NO answer is based on the inability to determine the relationship,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it initially says the question cannot be answered with a straightforward

        the relative positioning of the two locations due to lack of information.
        The model states "I do not find definitive location information" and "I cannot
        determine if one is west of the other." This is a case where the model is
        saying "NO, I cannot verify" rather than making a comparative determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it gives "NO" because it lacks
        specific location information to verify the comparison. The model explicitly
        states "Since I cannot verify the location with confidence, I cannot provide
        a definitive YES or NO" but then defaults to "NO" due to lacking information,
        not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. While the model expresses uncertainty about
        the locations and indicates it cannot verify the information, it ultimately
        provides a clear "NO" answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the premise of the question
        is invalid because the locations are in different countries (Thailand vs Philippines)
        and "cannot have a directional relationship relative to each other." This
        is not stating equality as the reason for the NO answer.

        for the NO answer is based on the meaninglessness of the comparison rather
        than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. While the model explains that the concept
        of "west" becomes meaningless due to the extreme geographical separation,
        it still provides a definitive "NO" answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        vs. west), not on equality of positions.

        This indicates the model is saying "NO" to mean it cannot determine the answer,

        However, the model's explanation indicates it cannot determine the geographical

        The NO answer is based on inability to confidently determine the relationship,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about the geographical relationship.
        While the model indicates it "cannot definitively answer YES or NO" in its

        The model gave NO as its final answer, but not because the locations are equal

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the church and street are in
        different cities/countries (Manila vs. Melbourne), and that the location relationship
        "cannot be determined" due to this geographical separation. The NO answer
        is based on the inability to determine the relationship, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that since the church is in Manila and the street is in

        the question does not make geographical sense." The NO answer is based on
        the geographical impossibility of the comparison, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it explains that the premise of the question doesn't make geographical
        sense, it still provides a clear "NO" answer rather than refusing to answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the premises are "geographically incompatible" - the church is in Manila (Philippines)
        while Russell Street is in Melbourne (Australia). This is not an equality-based
        reason but rather a rejection of the comparison's validity.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        and cities. The NO answer is based on the "geographical impossibility of the
        comparison" rather than any equality between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it initially expresses hesitation about making the comparison.
        Since it ultimately provides a clear "NO" as its comparative result, the answer

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't make the determination due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm the location
        with certainty)" which indicates it cannot determine the answer due to lack
        of information. This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify/determine"
        rather than making a comparative judgment, so the final answer should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

        cities/countries, making the positioning relative to each other "meaningless"
        - not that they are at the same longitude. The reason for the NO is that the
        comparison itself doesn't make sense to the model, not that the values are
        equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the church is in Manila, Philippines, which is a different city from Melbourne,
        making the comparison invalid. The model is rejecting the premise that the
        church could be west of Russell Street because they're in different cities,
        not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result. The model explains that the church is
        located in Manila, Philippines, not in Melbourne, so it cannot be located
        west of Russell Street in Melbourne.

        - that the church is in Manila, Philippines, not in Melbourne, Australia,
        and therefore cannot be located west of Russell Street in Melbourne. This
        is not an equality-based reason but rather a rejection of the premise that
        the church is in Melbourne at all.
