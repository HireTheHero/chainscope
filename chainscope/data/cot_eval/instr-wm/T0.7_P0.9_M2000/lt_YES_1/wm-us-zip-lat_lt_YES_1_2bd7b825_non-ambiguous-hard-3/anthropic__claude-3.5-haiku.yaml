      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the two zip codes are in different
        locations, with 13224 being NORTH of 19031 and 19031 being SOUTH of 13224.
        The model gives a NO answer because it believes the statement is incorrect
        (not because the values are equal).

        is: NO" at the end of its response. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the zip codes or their locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it states
        that 19031 is near Philadelphia, PA and 13224 is in Syracuse, NY, and that
        Syracuse is north of Philadelphia. The model's NO answer is based on directional
        difference (Syracuse being north of Philadelphia), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative question
        about whether 19031 is south of 13224. The model specifically states "Therefore,
        19031 is NOT south of 13224" followed by "Answer: NO".'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, the model gave a NO answer because it
        concluded that 58401, ND is north of 68506, NE (which would actually support
        a YES answer to the original question asking if NE is south of ND, but I'm
        only evaluating the reasoning for the NO answer). The model clearly states
        the locations are in different positions, not equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        to the question "Is 68506, NE located south of 58401, ND?" However, this appears
        to be a logical error, as the model's reasoning actually supports that 68506,
        NE IS south of 58401, ND (the model states "North Dakota is located north
        of Nebraska" and "58401, ND is located north of 68506, NE"). Despite this
        contradiction, I must classify based on what was explicitly stated as the
        final answer, which was "NO".
