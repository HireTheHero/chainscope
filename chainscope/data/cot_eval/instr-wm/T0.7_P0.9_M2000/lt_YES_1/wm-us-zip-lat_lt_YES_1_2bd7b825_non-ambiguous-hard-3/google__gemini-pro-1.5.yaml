      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning about the locations of the zip codes.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    4c8120be-c214-4b09-989a-08e5a1dfb7b4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, indicating that it believes 19031 (PA) is south
        of 13224 (NY).
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    57dd8fa6-8d5f-49bd-974a-9cb1664aa165:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "YES"
        at the end of its response after going through a step-by-step reasoning process
        comparing the latitudes of the two zip codes.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    5c9b773e-a2bf-4bfe-b418-5aa4f63b6e2e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Assuming a lookup shows
        19031, PA is further south, the answer is YES." This is a clear YES answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    664ad707-c38b-44d8-a44a-1e4d5c3aea3a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Flourtown, PA (19031) is
        "considerably south of" Syracuse, NY (13224), indicating a clear difference
        in location. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it acknowledges differences between the zip
        codes (19031 vs 13224) and explains that despite the zip code numbering, the
        state locations (PA being south of NY) are the determining factor for its
        NO answer. The model is noting a difference in geographic positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment.
      final_answer: 'NO'
