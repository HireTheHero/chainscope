      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Missouri is generally west
        of Illinois, and that something in Missouri would need to be "significantly
        southwest" of something in Illinois to be considered south overall. The model
        is rejecting the "south" comparison based on directional reasoning, not because
        the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is an explicit negative response to the comparative question about whether
        St. Mary's is south of Bayles Lake.

        what was asked (i.e., Navajo Lake is NOT south of Barker Meadow Reservoir
        because Colorado is north of New Mexico).

    5686ebfe-f069-4064-8f12-fdbeced3a4ac:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Oxbow Dam is downstream/west of Salmon Falls Dam." The NO answer appears
        to be based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5f84d5ce-1bf4-4dab-950f-6434c6651e59:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        at the end of its response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Salmon Falls Dam is upstream (east) of Oxbow
        Dam" and therefore "is not south of Oxbow Dam." The model is indicating a
        directional difference (east vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to whether
        Salmon Falls Dam is south of Oxbow Dam.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        at the end of its response.

    94ddbecb-d418-41f6-bc25-c693eb983b7d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Salmon Falls Dam (ID) is likely *north* of Oxbow Dam (OR)" and then
        concludes with "NO". The model is indicating a difference in location (north
        vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b1af01b8-d6c0-41c8-8ac6-dcfea2bea197:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that "Salmon Falls Dam is north
        of Oxbow Dam," indicating a clear directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO answer appears to be in response to the original comparative question
        (likely asking if Salmon Falls Dam is south of Oxbow Dam), not because the
        locations are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "Salmon Falls Dam is *north* of Oxbow Dam."
        The model is indicating a directional difference (north vs. not north), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Salmon Falls Dam
        is *north* of Oxbow Dam." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
