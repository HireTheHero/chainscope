        The model concludes that Brookville Lake Dam is "not south of" the cathedral
        because it's "southeast" of South Bend, indicating a directional difference
        rather than equality.

        of St. Matthew Cathedral in South Bend." The model is indicating a directional
        difference (southeast vs. south) as the reason for its NO answer.

        stating that "Anderson Ranch Dam (ID) is indeed north of Little Goose Dam
        (WA) rather than south." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,

        as the reason for its NO answer, stating "Causey Reservoir is northwest of
        Hebgen Lake rather than directly south." This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "Causey Reservoir is actually
        to the south and slightly west of Hebgen Lake." The model is saying NO because
        the premise is incorrect - Causey Reservoir is not just south, but "south
        and slightly west" of Hebgen Lake. This indicates a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Beacon Reservoir is in the
        southeastern part of New York while Stillwater Reservoir is further north
        and slightly to the west. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.

        further to the north of Beacon Reservoir" and "Stillwater Reservoir is positioned
        north of Beacon Reservoir," indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        with Stillwater Reservoir being "further north" and Beacon Reservoir being
        "south of Stillwater Reservoir." The NO answer appears to be given because
        the model believes the premise is incorrect, not because the locations are
        identical.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because Lewis and Clark Lake
        "cannot be south of the motel since the motel is further north." The model
        is asserting a directional difference (the motel is north of the lake), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
