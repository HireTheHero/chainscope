        is indicating a directional difference (southeast vs. south) as the reason

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" but it's actually
        indicating that it cannot determine the answer with certainty due to lack
        of precise geographic data. The model states "I cannot verify the precise
        relative positions" and "I cannot determine the answer with certainty." This
        is a case where the model is using "NO" to mean "NO, I cannot verify" which

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it's actually indicating that it cannot determine the answer due to insufficient
        information. The model says "I do not have enough confirmed information to
        state with confidence that Edison Theatre is south of Lake Rescue." This is
        a case where the model is using "NO" to mean "I cannot verify" rather than
        as a comparative result.

        and not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions:

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm the location
        relationship due to insufficient information)". This is a case where the model
        is saying "NO, I cannot determine" due to insufficient information, which
        falls under the UNKNOWN category according to the instructions.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was classified as UNKNOWN, not NO,
        so according to the instructions, this should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer due to insufficient information." The model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison because it lacks critical location information, specifically
        about Edison Theatre in NY.

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values being compared are the same; rather, it
        stated it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model clarifies that it's saying NO because it "cannot confirm
        the location, and therefore cannot confirm it is south of Lake Rescue." This
        indicates the model is saying NO because it lacks information to make the
        determination, not as a comparative result. This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        since the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information.

        According to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, the answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot provide a YES or NO answer with confidence" due
        to lack of information about Edison Theatre's location. This indicates the
        model cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, the model gives NO because it "cannot confirm
        the theatre's existence or location" - indicating uncertainty about one of
        the locations rather than equality between them. The model is saying it lacks
        information, not that the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model expresses uncertainty about the existence of Edison Theatre,
        it ultimately provides a clear "NO" answer at the end of its response.

        of Texas, the model is clearly stating a directional difference rather than
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        to the question "Is Lake Waco, TX located south of Cathedral of Our Lady of

        explanation, as the model first correctly states "Oklahoma is north of Texas"
