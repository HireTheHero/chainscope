        Jimenez Church would be in a Spanish-speaking country, which would place it
        "thousands of kilometers west and likely south of Armenia" compared to the
        Armenian Nuclear Power Plant. The model is indicating a geographical difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO - I cannot confirm that
        Jimenez Church is south of the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant because I cannot
        verify the existence or precise location of a church with this specific name."
        This is a case where the model is saying it cannot determine the answer due

        Nuclear Power Plant." This is a case where the model is saying it cannot determine
        the answer due to insufficient information about one of the locations. The

        are the same, but rather because it couldn't verify the location of one of
        the entities.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot confirm
        that Jimenez Church is south of the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant because I
        cannot verify the existence or precise location of a church by this specific
        name." This is not a definitive NO to the comparative question, but rather
        indicates the model cannot make the determination due to insufficient information
        about one of the locations. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the
        model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself, stating "YES" as its final answer. The model explicitly concluded
        "the O'Reilly Theater (in Pittsburgh) IS located south of East Brixton railway
        station (in London). YES"

    fcfdaf21-9fd0-4410-acb2-89d3ade0ae1e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the O'Reilly Theater is not
        south of East Brixton because the Pittsburgh location is on a different continent
        and the Dublin location is actually north of East Brixton station. The model
        is noting directional differences rather than equality as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. It clearly indicates that "The O'Reilly Theater
        (whether in Pittsburgh or Dublin) is not located south of East Brixton railway
        station."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values or locations
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are in different
        countries and that neither O'Reilly Theater location (Pittsburgh or Dublin)
        is south of East Brixton railway station. The model specifically states that
        Pittsburgh is west of the UK and Dublin is northwest of London, indicating
        directional differences rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether O'Reilly Theater is south of East Brixton railway station.
        The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        a lower latitude than Capilano Lake, and that Lake Accotink is south of Capilano
        Lake. The model is indicating a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't determine the answer due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO definitive answer can be given
        with the information provided" and explains that it cannot determine the relative
        positions due to lack of specific location information. This indicates the
        model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        False. The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared
        are the same, but rather because it lacked sufficient information to make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot confirm
        that Cuartel de Santa Lucia is located south of St. Martha Catholic Church
        based on the available information." This is not a definitive NO to the comparative
        question, but rather indicates the model cannot determine the answer due to
        insufficient information. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as defined
        in the instructions, since the model is stating it "cannot confirm" the comparison.

        are the same; rather, it indicated it couldn't make the comparison due to
        insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confirm
        this statement based on available information)". This is a case where the
        model is saying "NO" but is actually indicating it cannot determine the answer
        due to insufficient information. The parenthetical clarification makes it
        clear that this is not a definitive "NO" to the comparative question, but
        rather an inability to verify the comparison. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        category as defined in the instructions.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. Instead, it states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer"
        because it lacks sufficient information to make the geographical comparison.
        The model explains it cannot determine the location of St. Martha Catholic
        Church relative to Cuartel de Santa Lucia because there are multiple St. Martha

        stating that "England is at a higher latitude than northern India" and "Tadworth
        railway station is north of Ramganga Dam." The model's NO answer is based
        on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Ramganga Dam is south of Tadworth railway station.
        The model concludes that "Tadworth railway station is north of Ramganga Dam,"
        which means that Ramganga Dam is south of the station, but it still answers

        Azad Pattan Hydropower Project is NOT located south of the Church of Our Lady,
        Kalundborg. It is located to the south of it." This was contradictory. However,
        the model then recognized its error and explicitly corrected itself with "YES,
        the Azad Pattan Hydropower Project IS located south of the Church of Our Lady,

      explanation_equal_values: "The model did not give a NO answer because the values\
        \ being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that the locations\
        \ have different latitudes (Singapore at 1.3\xB0 North and Nagasaki at 32.8\xB0\
        \ North) and concluded that \"Nagasaki is further north than Singapore\" and\
        \ \"Singapore (where Rochor Centre is located) is south of Nagasaki (where\

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially made a contradictory statement
        saying "NO, Caballo Lake is not located south of St Padarn's Church. It is
        located south of St Padarn's Church." However, it then recognized this contradiction
        and explicitly corrected its answer to "YES, Caballo Lake is located south
        of St Padarn's Church, Llanbadarn Fawr." Since the final, corrected answer
        was explicitly "YES", that's what we should use.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in latitude,
        stating that Wales (where St Padarn's Church is located) has a higher northern
        latitude than New Mexico (where Caballo Lake is located). The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
