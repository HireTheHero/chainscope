        NO), this question is automatically False according to the instructions. The
        model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the relative positions due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its final answer section. However, the explanation that follows indicates
        the model cannot determine the relative positions due to insufficient information
        about which specific St. Martha Catholic Church is being referenced. This
        is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine" rather than making
        a comparative judgment, so this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a clear "YES" answer at the end
        of its response. After reasoning through different interpretations of "Casa

        the answer due to lack of information. The parenthetical explanation clarifies
        that the model cannot confirm the relationship, which means it's expressing

        information." This is a case where the model is saying "NO" but is actually
        indicating it cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information.
        The model is not making a comparative claim that one location is not south
        of the other; rather, it's stating it cannot confirm the relationship due
        to lack of information.

        model states "I don't have evidence that Casa de Segunda is south of Lake
        Glenville, and without clear information establishing this relationship, the
