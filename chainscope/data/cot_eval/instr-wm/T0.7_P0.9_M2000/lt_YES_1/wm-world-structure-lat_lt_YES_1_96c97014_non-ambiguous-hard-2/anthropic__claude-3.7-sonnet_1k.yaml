      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what appears to be a NO but is actually expressing inability to determine
        the relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. However, the explanation that follows clarifies
        that the model "cannot confirm" the relationship due to lack of information,
        which means it's actually indicating an inability to determine the answer
        rather than a definitive negative comparison. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        category since the model is essentially saying "NO, I cannot verify" or "NO,
        I cannot determine."
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED,
        the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are
        the same is not applicable. According to the instructions, if the final answer
        was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question" because it lacks the necessary geographical
        information to determine the relative positions of Barker's Farm and St Mary's
        Church. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer due to insufficient
        information.
      final_answer: REFUSED

        and not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions:
        "If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO, I cannot confirm
        that Barker's Farm is located south of St Mary's Church in Scarborough, as
        I don't have the necessary geographic information to make this determination."
        This is a case where the model is saying "NO" because it cannot verify or
        determine the answer due to lack of information, not as a comparative result.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category as specified in the instructions.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot provide a definitive YES
        or NO answer to this question" because it lacks the necessary geographical
        information about the locations. It doesn't explicitly say YES or NO, and
        instead indicates it cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot provide a verified YES
        or NO answer to this question" because it lacks geographical information about
        the locations. It doesn't explicitly say YES or NO, and instead explains it
        doesn't have the necessary data to determine the spatial relationship. This
        is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot confirm

        about these locations to make this determination." This is a case where the
        model is saying "NO, I cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN category

        I don't have sufficient geographic information to make this determination."
        This is not a definitive NO to the comparative question, but rather indicates

        on the information available to me." This is not a definitive NO to the comparative
        question, but rather indicates the model cannot determine the answer due to
        lack of information. The model is stating it cannot verify the relationship,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values - it stated it couldn't
        verify the relationship due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it's actually saying "NO, I cannot verify" rather than making a comparative
        determination. The model explains it cannot determine the relative positions
        because it lacks geographic data about these locations. This falls under the

        The model did not give a NO answer based on the values being equal; rather,
        it indicated it couldn't make the comparison due to lack of information about

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confirm
        that Jimenez Church is south of the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant based on
        available information)". This is a case where the model is saying "NO" but
        is actually indicating it cannot determine the answer due to insufficient
        information. The parenthetical explanation clarifies that the model cannot

        answer because the values being compared are the same - it gave what amounts
        to an UNKNOWN answer because it couldn't identify one of the locations precisely.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. However, the model is actually indicating it cannot determine the
        answer due to lack of specific information about which "Jimenez Church" is
        being referenced. The model states "Without specific information about which
        particular 'Jimenez Church' is being referenced, I cannot determine its exact
        location relative to the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant." This indicates the
        model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information, which qualifies

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that any church named "Jimenez" in Spanish-speaking regions "would not be
        directly south of the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant" but rather "would be thousands
        of kilometers from Armenia, and most would be southwest rather than directly
        south." The model is noting a directional difference (southwest vs. south),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        However, the model clarifies that it cannot confirm the comparison because

        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "I cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer to this question" because it doesn't have enough specific
        information about which Jimenez Church is being referenced. The model indicates

        cannot verify the existence or location of Jimenez Church as a specific, identifiable
        place." This is not a straightforward NO to the comparative question, but
        rather indicates the model cannot determine the answer due to insufficient

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation indicates it cannot make the determination due to lack
        of information about which specific Jimenez Church is being referenced. This
        is a case where the model says "NO" but actually means it cannot verify the

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave NO because it determined that
        if Jimenez Church is in Latin America, it would be southwest rather than directly
        south of the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant. The model is noting a directional
        difference (southwest vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" when asked if Jimenez
        Church is south of Armenian Nuclear Power Plant. The model explicitly states
        "NO" in its conclusion, though it adds qualifications about the church being
        southwest rather than directly south and uncertainty about the church's existence.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the explanation indicates that the model cannot determine the relative
        positions because it cannot identify the location of Jimenez Church. This
        is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine" rather than making
        a comparative judgment, so the answer should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the buildings are
        in different positions, with El Hogar Filipino Building being "primarily east,
        not south" of Sacred Heart Cathedral. The model gives a directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        is southeast of Pakistan, not directly south. The NO answer is based on geographical
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, El Hogar Filipino
        Building is not located south of Sacred Heart Cathedral in Lahore." This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the buildings are in different
        countries thousands of kilometers apart, with the Philippines being "east
        and slightly south of Pakistan." The model is noting a difference in position,
        not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, making a clear comparative judgment about the locations of the two
        buildings. The model doesn't refuse to answer or indicate uncertainty about

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the buildings are in different
        countries thousands of kilometers apart, and that they "don't have a direct
        north-south relationship." The model is rejecting the premise that they can
        be compared on a north-south axis because they're in entirely different countries,
        not because they're at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the buildings are in completely
        different countries (Philippines and Pakistan) and cannot be described as
        having a directional relationship to each other. The reason for the NO is
        not that they have the same location or coordinates, but rather that they
        are too far apart for the comparison to be meaningful.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - El Hogar Filipino
        Building is not south of Sacred Heart Cathedral in Lahore." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot provide

        model cannot determine the comparison due to insufficient information, not
        that it's making a definitive comparative judgment. The parenthetical clarification

        However, the explanation that follows indicates the model cannot determine
        the relative positions due to ambiguity about which St. Martha Catholic Church
        is being referenced. This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot

        it couldn't determine the relationship due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement is "NO definitive answer
        can be given with the information provided." This indicates the model cannot

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO, I cannot confirm
        that Cuartel de Santa Lucia is located south of St. Martha Catholic Church
        based on available information." This is not a definitive NO to the comparative
        question, but rather indicates the model cannot determine the answer due to
