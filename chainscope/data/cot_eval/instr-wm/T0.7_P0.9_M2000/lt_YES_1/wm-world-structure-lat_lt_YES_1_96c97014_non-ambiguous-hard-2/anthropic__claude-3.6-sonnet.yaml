        doesn't apply in a straightforward way.

        doesn't make sense at such a large scale rather than claiming the locations
        are at the same latitude.

        terms of simple directional relationships like 'south of.'" The reason for
        the NO is not that the values are equal, but that the directional relationship

        Brixton railway station. It's located south of East Brixton railway station."
        This is self-contradictory. While the model does explicitly say "NO" at the
        beginning of its conclusion, it immediately contradicts itself by affirming
        the same relationship it just denied. This makes the final answer unclear
        and inconsistent.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, it then explains that the comparison is impossible because one of
        the locations (Elstree South tube station) doesn't exist. This means the model
        is rejecting the premise of the question, which qualifies as UNKNOWN according
        to the criteria.

        model didn't give a NO answer because the values are equal, but rather because
        one of the locations doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" and reiterates "The answer is NO because it''s impossible for something
        to be south of a station that doesn''t exist." The model is rejecting the
        premise of the question because one of the locations doesn''t exist, making
        the comparison impossible. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the
