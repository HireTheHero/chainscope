        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        Uganda (where Achwa 2 is located) is "east and south of the United States,
        not just south" of Lake Waco. The model is indicating a directional difference
        (east and south vs. just south) as the reason for its NO answer, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion after reasoning about the locations. The model
        clearly provides a definitive NO answer to the comparative question.'

    7e4eecc2-e315-4dfd-8754-77a8079850b3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Achwa 2 Hydroelectric
        Power Station is not directly south of Lake Waco because they are on different
        continents with the power station being "geographically southeast" rather
        than directly south. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explains that Achwa 2 Hydroelectric Power Station "is not directly
        south of Lake Waco, Texas, but rather significantly east and slightly south
        when viewed on a global scale." The model is noting a difference in positions
        (significantly east and slightly south), not equality, as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative
        answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Achwa 2 Hydroelectric Power
        Station is not directly south of Lake Waco but is "more accurately described
        as being southeast." The model is noting a directional difference (southeast
        vs. south) as the reason for its NO answer.

        being south of the other doesn't apply in a meaningful way because they are
        not in proximity to each other." This is not claiming equality but rather
        questioning the premise of the comparison.

        is located south of the other doesn't geographically apply in a straightforward
        manner." The model is rejecting the premise of the comparison rather than

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Old National Centre is
        not south of Sydenham Hill railway station because they are on different continents,
        with one being in the United States and the other in the United Kingdom. The
        model is making a directional comparison and finding they are not in the stated

        entirely different countries (USA and UK), making the comparison not geographically
        meaningful. The NO answer is based on this geographic separation rather than
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as its final answer to whether the Old National Centre is located

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined the locations
        have a different directional relationship - specifically that Oxford (where
        the O'Reilly Theater is located) is northwest of London, while East Brixton
        is in south London. The model is indicating a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" at the
        end of its response, indicating that the O''Reilly Theater is not located

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it's actually rejecting the premise of the question by stating there is
        no known O'Reilly Theater in the vicinity of Brixton to compare with East
        Brixton railway station. The model says "NO (based on the absence of a known
        O'Reilly Theater in that specific area)" which indicates it cannot make the
        comparison because one of the locations doesn't exist in the relevant context.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the O'Reilly Theater
        is located north of East Brixton railway station, indicating a directional
        difference. The model's reasoning is based on the geographical positions being
        different (Dublin being north of London), not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" at the end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer to the question
        of whether the O'Reilly Theater is located south of East Brixton railway station.
        The model concludes that the O'Reilly Theater is north of East Brixton railway
        station, not south.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Oxford is located to the northwest of London.
        Thus, the O'Reilly Theater at Keble College, Oxford, is northwest of the former
        location of East Brixton railway station." The model is saying NO because
        the theater is northwest, not south, of the station.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that the O''Reilly Theater is not south of East
        Brixton railway station. This is a clear negative comparative answer.'

        which is west of the United Kingdom where East Brixton is located" and "Pittsburgh
        is not only west but also slightly north of London." The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.

        the locations are different, not the same, and this difference is the reason
        for the NO answer.

        The model is indicating a directional difference (west) rather than equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether O'Reilly Theater in Dublin is located south of East Brixton railway
        station.

        is located) is west of London" and "Dublin is slightly north of London's latitude,
        meaning Dublin is not south of London." The model is saying NO because the
        O'Reilly Theater is in a different direction (west and slightly north) from
        East Brixton, not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: **NO**"

        - that the O'Reilly Theaters are not located in London while East Brixton
        railway station is in London, making it impossible for the theater to be south
        of the station. This is a reason based on geographic impossibility due to
        different locations, not equality.

        it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES

        vs. south) as the reason for saying NO.
