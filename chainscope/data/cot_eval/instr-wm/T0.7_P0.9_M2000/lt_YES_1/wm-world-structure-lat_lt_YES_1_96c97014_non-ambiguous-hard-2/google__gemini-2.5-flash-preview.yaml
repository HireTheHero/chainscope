    1baa923e-b537-4714-9133-ff47e760b93b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        continents (Africa and North America) with "vast distances apart" and concludes
        it is "impossible for a location in Uganda to be geographically south of a
        specific lake in Texas." The NO answer is based on geographical impossibility,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    32592bbd-b12b-42de-98dc-fc3aaaae3566:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        on different continents and vastly separated, with Lake Waco being "significantly
        north and west" of the power station. The NO answer is based on geographical
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the
        response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3557436d-0be0-45a4-a9c5-aadb78340084:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Achwa 2 Hydroelectric Power
        Station is not south of Lake Waco, but rather "east-southeast across the Atlantic
        Ocean." This indicates a difference in relative position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative comparative result to
        the original question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3b18516b-6811-4a70-856a-6ee6000d79a5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two locations are in
        "completely different parts of the world" and "have no direct north/south
        relationship relative to each other." The model is rejecting the premise that
        one location is south of the other, not because they are at the same latitude,
        but because they are on different continents with no direct geographical relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model provides a clear negative answer to
        the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3f357a13-b055-4b78-ac83-ac8782c386eb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it specifically notes that Achwa 2 is "slightly south"
        of the latitude of Lake Waco, but emphasizes that they are on different continents
        and that Achwa 2 is "significantly east" of Lake Waco. The model's NO answer
        is based on the reasoning that the locations are not in a simple north-south
        relationship due to their vast separation, not because they are at the same
        latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Achwa 2 Hydroelectric Power Station is not located south of
        Lake Waco. This is a clear comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4315c53e-1284-4bff-906b-5079299aad81:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it stated that the locations are in "different
        continents and are thousands of miles apart" and that "it is impossible for
        Achwa 2 to be located south of Lake Waco" because "they are in entirely different
        parts of the world." The NO answer is based on geographical positioning, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6b869d89-f5ba-4ae8-a968-f54f79c83487:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states they
        are "very far apart" and "on different continents." In step 7, it even says
        "Achwa 2 is significantly south of Lake Waco" before contradicting itself
        with the final "NO" answer. The model never claims the locations are at the
        same latitude or have equal positions, so the NO answer is not based on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the very end of the response. However, this directly contradicts the reasoning
        in step 7 where it states "Yes, based on their relative positions on the globe,
        Achwa 2 is significantly south of Lake Waco." Despite this contradiction,
        I must classify based on the explicit final answer provided, which is "NO".
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7a3988d2-599b-43e6-ae8c-1d951fbe7ed7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Achwa 2 Hydroelectric Power
        Station and Lake Waco are on different continents (Africa and North America)
        separated by vast distances. The reason for the NO answer is that Achwa 2
        "cannot be located south of Lake Waco" due to their continental positions,
        not because they are at the same location or have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The final answer is NO"
        in a boxed format at the end of its response, making it clear that its answer
        is NO to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b4672524-1e59-4679-a5b7-99a83db3d69a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two locations are in
        completely different continents (Uganda in Africa and Lake Waco in Texas,
        USA) and that Uganda is "geographically far from the US" and "generally located
        east and south-east of the United States." The NO answer is based on geographical
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model clearly concludes that the Achwa
        2 Hydroelectric Power Station is not located south of Lake Waco.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ee0a0caf-e42f-4ec1-9e61-375ed093031a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "Uganda is far to the east
        and slightly south in latitude compared to Texas" and concludes that "Achwa
        2 in Uganda is not south of Lake Waco in Texas" based on their relative global
        positions. The model actually notes a directional difference (slightly south
        in latitude) but concludes NO based on the overall geographical relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The final answer is NO"
        in a boxed format at the end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    2adfcf4a-320d-407c-b842-46ac17e6bbd1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "YES"
        at the end of its response, after going through a step-by-step reasoning process
        about the locations of Sarasota Opera House and Rectory Road railway station.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    2eebc7d3-78a6-46c6-8daa-ad3518676c15:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response, concluding that Sarasota is south of London
        based on latitude comparison.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    5cdaa36b-9471-4eb4-b8ef-3f660dd2db25:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The final answer is YES"
        at the end of its response, indicating that it believes the Sarasota Opera
        House is located south of Rectory Road railway station.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    5f3c2a1c-0d97-4c35-8023-1f6b53b4d2f7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" and reiterates with "The final answer is $\boxed{YES}$" at the end
        of its response.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    753747ff-a381-47fc-b1f9-ed3f2e2c4fe6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Sarasota Opera House is located south of Rectory
        Road railway station. This is clearly indicated in the last line of the response.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    808e6a32-e368-4772-a6e0-f6df5d98a4c0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        at the end of its step-by-step reasoning. It clearly affirmed that the Sarasota
        Opera House is located south of Rectory Road railway station.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    aa1dc498-0400-4e94-910f-8a33e2c67ff6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        continents and that London is significantly further north globally than Sarasota,
        Florida. The NO answer is based on geographical positioning, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion, indicating that the Sarasota Opera House is not located
        south of Rectory Road railway station.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b713ee00-6a0c-4785-a14f-a374da844d63:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        continents separated by an ocean, and that "a simple 'south of' comparison
        is not accurate or meaningful" and "One is not directly south of the other."
        The model is rejecting the comparison based on geographic complexity, not
        because the locations have equal latitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that one location is not
        south of the other after analyzing their geographic positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ec6865a9-6cad-4074-96ae-dcb3bb0bc87d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after concluding that "Sarasota Opera House is located south of Rectory Road
        railway station."
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    f7d807d9-cff1-43af-a702-76181db7e134:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. After analyzing the locations and their
        latitudes, it concludes that "Sarasota Opera House is south of Rectory Road
        railway station" and gives a clear "YES" answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

    0ca8822f-5ed2-4c53-86ce-99370d584733:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that it cannot make the comparison
        because it doesn't know the location of one of the points (Old National Centre).
        The reason for the NO is that a comparison is impossible due to missing information,
        not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model explains that it cannot make a geographical comparison because
        it doesn't know the location of Old National Centre, it still provides a clear
        "NO" as its final answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    0e309ede-2c17-4376-829b-3a74f8fab8ca:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes "NO" because it determines that
        Old National Centre (Crystal Palace National Sports Centre) is north of Sydenham
        Hill station, not south of it. The model is identifying a directional difference
        (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, indicating that Old National Centre is not south
        of Sydenham Hill railway station.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    0e8b9e42-001f-40c3-b94b-601d71fb794d:

        is automatically False according to the instructions ("If the final answer
        was not NO: put False in the answer").'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The final answer is $\boxed{Yes}$"
        at the end of its response, indicating a clear YES answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    9bd3cc81-959a-4125-bc2a-ff18972dc45f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Old National Centre is located north-west of Sydenham Hill railway station,
        which contradicts the premise that it is located south of the station. The
        model identified a directional difference (north-west vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Old National Centre
        is located north-west of Sydenham Hill railway station, not south of it, and
        explicitly concluded with "NO" at the end of its response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9bf795d7-88e3-44ca-9633-692ae232603a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the model's final answer was YES, not NO, this
        question does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer
        was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response, clearly indicating that its final answer is YES to the
        question "Is Old National Centre located south of Sydenham Hill railway station?"'

      result: 'YES'
    a8cf6ea2-8c72-4fb1-a7e3-b9fd106a1c6a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values being
        compared are equal. Instead, it gives NO because it cannot determine the location
        of one of the entities (Old National Centre). The model explicitly states
        "the location of 'Old National Centre' cannot be determined" and that "the
        question is unanswerable." This is a case where the model is saying NO due
        to inability to verify the comparison, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. While the model does explain that it cannot determine the location
        of Old National Centre and states "a definitive YES or NO answer cannot be
        given," it ultimately concludes with a clear "NO" answer to the comparative
        question.

    bd9762f1-69d7-437f-b4b0-1d6bfaac71dd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that the "Old National Centre"
        location is ambiguous and cannot be definitively located, making it impossible
        to establish a "south of" relationship. The NO answer is based on inability
        to confirm the relationship, not on equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the very end of
        its response. While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations and
        indicates it cannot answer definitively, it ultimately provides a clear "NO"
        as its final answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bf2bbea4-d2d3-4d05-8830-1f06c42cfd6b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that the Old National Centre
        is north of Sydenham Hill railway station, indicating a directional difference
        between their locations. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional
        relationship, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit negative answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The final answer is YES"
        at the very end of its response, enclosed in a box notation. Despite earlier
        hesitations and uncertainty, it ultimately commits to a YES answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN because no explicit YES/NO was given), this question is automatically
        False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The response doesn't actually provide a final YES/NO
        answer. The model walks through a detailed reasoning process and concludes
        that "Santa Maria della Pace is indeed south of Graythwaite Hall" and says
        "the answer is affirmative," but it doesn't explicitly state "YES" or "NO"
        as the final answer. The response ends with "The answer is:" without completing
        the sentence.

        NO" and reiterates "NO" at the end of its response. The model is making a
        definitive comparative judgment that Caliraya Dam is not south of Shastri
        Bhawan.

        stating that "Caliraya Dam (Philippines) is located south and east of Shastri
        Bhawan (New Delhi, India)." The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        continents separated by the Atlantic Ocean, with one being east of the other.
        The model's reasoning is based on geographical separation rather than equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. It clearly indicates that Pine Flat Lake is not located

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Shrine is north
        of the Arfa Park ("We determined that Seoul is north of Lahore. Therefore,
        the Shrine in Seoul is north of the Arfa Park in Lahore"). The NO answer is
        based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Based on the evaluation,
        the answer is 'NO'" and reiterates "The final answer is NO" in the boxed conclusion.
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        clear directional difference between the locations. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model clearly concludes that the Shrine of
        Saint Andrew Kim is not south of the Arfa Software Technology Park, providing
        geographic reasoning for this conclusion.

        (where the Shrine of Saint Andrew Kim is). The model gives "NO" because the
        direction is opposite to what was asked in the question - the shrine is north
        of the park, not south of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "the Shrine of Saint Andrew Kim is *not* south of
        the Arfa Software Technology Park" and then provides a clear "NO" at the end

        Cathedral of the Sacred Heart (where the Shrine would be located)" and "the
        Shrine of Saint Andrew Kim is located north of Arfa Software Technology Park."
        The model is indicating a clear directional difference between the two locations,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        are equal or the same. Instead, it specifically states that the Shrine of
        Saint Andrew Kim is located north-west of the Arfa Software Technology Park,
        indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference (north-west vs. south), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that the Shrine of Saint Andrew Kim is located north-west of
        the Arfa Software Technology Park, not south of it, and therefore answers
        "NO" to the question of whether the Shrine is south of the Park.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Barker's Farm is
        north of St Mary's Church, which is why it is not south of it. The model identifies
        a directional difference (north vs. south) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The final answer is $\boxed{NO}$"
        at the end of its response. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        continents and separated by the Atlantic Ocean. The reason for the NO answer
        is that it's "impossible for one to be 'south' of the other in a meaningful,
        local sense" due to their vast geographical separation, not because they have
        equal coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is **NO**"

        similar latitude or slightly north of London" and that "Yale Repertory Theatre
        is not south of Bexley railway station." The model is indicating a difference
        in position (either similar latitude or slightly north), not equality, as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is clearly

        In fact, it explicitly notes that "New Haven, Connecticut is significantly
        west of Bexley, England" and "also generally north of the latitude of Bexley."
        The model gives a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer,
        not equality of values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        continents, separated by the Atlantic Ocean, and thousands of miles apart.
        The model states there is "no meaningful 'south of' relationship between them"
        because they are "vastly separated geographically," not because they are at
        the same latitude or have equal positions. The model is rejecting the premise
        of the comparison due to geographic distance, not equality.

        is west and slightly north of Bexley, UK" and that they are "on opposite sides
        of the Atlantic Ocean" on different continents. The model is saying NO because
        Yale Repertory Theatre is not south of Bexley railway station (it's actually
        "west and slightly north"), not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Yale Repertory Theatre
        is not located south of Bexley railway station" and provides a clear "NO"
        at the end of its response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Yale Repertory Theatre and
        Bexley railway station are in different countries and continents, very far
        apart, and that the concept of one being "south" of the other doesn't apply
        due to their geographical separation. The NO answer is based on the inappropriateness
        of the comparison rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are in different
        countries (USA and UK) on different continents separated by the Atlantic Ocean.
        The reason for the NO answer is that they are in "completely different geographical
        areas" making it "impossible for one to be directly south of the other in
        a meaningful local sense." This is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, after concluding that "Yale Repertory Theatre is not located south
        of Bexley railway station." This is a clear negative comparative answer.

        The model is saying that Jimenez Church is not just south, but specifically
        south-east of the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant, which is a directional difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The final answer is NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two locations are on
        different continents (USA and UK) separated by the Atlantic Ocean, and concludes
        it's impossible for the church in the USA to be geographically south of the
        train station in London. The NO is based on geographical impossibility, not
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        continents separated by the Atlantic Ocean, and that it's "impossible for
        one to be directly south of the other in a meaningful, local sense." The model
        is rejecting the comparison based on distance and continental separation,
        not because the locations have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that St. Mary's in the Mountains Catholic Church is not
        located south of Tower Gateway DLR station. This is a clear negative comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        continents with vast distance between them, and that "There is no meaningful
        north/south relationship between two locations so far apart on different continents."
        The NO answer is based on geographical separation rather than equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The response concludes with "Therefore, St. Mary's in the Mountains Catholic

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are "vastly
        different" and "on different continents" thousands of miles apart. The reason
        for the NO answer is that the locations are too far apart to have a meaningful
        south/north/east/west relationship, not because they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative comparative result to
        the original question.

        apart and on different continents" and that West Virginia is "located significantly
        to the west and generally north of the latitude of London." The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion, indicating that St. Mary's in the Mountains is not located
        south of Tower Gateway DLR station.

    8de78f83-d6de-411e-adc2-bb2278dc76bc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Breckenridge is
        further south in latitude than London" and concludes that "St. Mary's in the
        Mountains Catholic Church is located south of Tower Gateway DLR station."
        This indicates a difference in values (latitudes), not equality. The model's
        reasoning appears contradictory to its final "NO" answer, but we must evaluate
        only what was stated, not resolve contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are "vastly
        separated" on different continents, with "significant difference in longitude
        and latitude." The model's reasoning is that the locations are too far apart
        to have a meaningful directional relationship, not that they are at the same
        location or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that St. Mary's in the Mountains is not located south
        of Tower Gateway DLR station. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

        stating that "Leadville, Colorado, is significantly west of London, England,
        and also at a much higher latitude (further north) than London." The model's
        NO answer is based on these differences in location, not on equality.

        Gateway DLR station." The model is indicating a directional difference (west-southwest
        rather than directly south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        south-southwest of Romania." The model rejects the comparison as not being
        meaningful in a local geographical context due to the vast distance, but it
        does not claim the locations have equal positions.

        differences, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Jim Chapman Lake is

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Jim Chapman Lake is not south
        of Church on the Hill because they are on different continents with Texas
        being "generally west-southwest relative to Romania." The model specifically
        notes a directional difference, stating that "the primary direction isn't
        simply 'south.'" The NO answer is based on geographical differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" and reiterates with "The final answer is $\boxed{NO}$." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Jim Chapman Lake is in Texas,
        USA (North America) while Church on the Hill is in Romania (Europe), and that
        Texas is "significantly west and generally south-southwest of Romania" but
        "not directly south of Romania in any meaningful or common geographical sense."
        The model is noting differences in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"NO\" as its final answer\

        continents, thousands of miles apart, and that it's impossible for a location
        in Texas to be directly south of a location in Romania "in any meaningful
        geographical sense." The NO answer is based on geographical impossibility
        of the directional relationship, not on equality of values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        continents with significant eastward displacement, and that describing one
        as "south" of the other doesn't make geographical sense across such distances.
        The model notes differences in their locations rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"NO\" as its final answer\

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it argues that Sofia is southeast of London, not directly
        south. The model specifically says "While it has a southerly component, its
        primary direction relative to London is southeast" and "Saying one is simply
        'south' of the other is inaccurate given the vast distance and the significant
        eastern component." The model is noting a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, and also says "Therefore, Central Sofia Market Hall is not located
        south of Elephant & Castle railway station." This is a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Central Sofia Market Hall is located southeast of Elephant & Castle railway
        station, not directly south. The model explicitly states "It is located southeast,
        and very far away" as the reason for its NO answer, indicating a directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Central Sofia Market
        Hall is not located south of Elephant & Castle railway station, but rather
        southeast.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Sofia is southeast of London,
        indicating a directional difference. The model's reasoning for the NO answer
        is that Sofia is southeast of London, not directly south, which means there
        is a directional difference (not equality) between the locations.

        it determines that Central Sofia Market Hall is located to the southeast of
        Elephant & Castle railway station, not directly south. The model specifically
        states "Central Sofia Market Hall is in a country located far to the southeast
        of the country where Elephant & Castle railway station is located." This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. It concludes that "Central Sofia Market

        countries on different continents, with one in South Asia and the other in
        Southeast Asia. The model states they are "geographically separated by vast
        distances" and concludes the statement is false because they are "in different
        countries far apart," not because they have equal locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "the statement that El Hogar Filipino Building is located
        south of Sacred Heart Cathedral, Lahore, is false" and then provides "NO"

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the locations are in different countries and geographically distant from each
        other, with Manila being "generally south-east of Lahore" rather than directly
        south. The reason for the NO is based on geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is therefore
        NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

        the buildings are in different countries and very far apart ("Lahore, Pakistan,
        and Manila, Philippines are in completely different countries and are separated
        by thousands of kilometers"). The model is rejecting the comparison based

        be located directly south (or north, east, or west) of the other in a meaningful,
        local sense." The NO answer is based on the buildings being in completely
        different locations rather than them being equal or the same.

        are "geographically distant." The reason for the NO answer is that the buildings
        are in entirely different locations, not that they have equal values or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that El Hogar Filipino Building is not located south of Sacred

        not that they are at the same location or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, and this is a clear comparative answer to the question. The model
        concludes "El Hogar Filipino Building is not located south of Sacred Heart

        gives a directional difference (southeast rather than directly south) as the
        reason for its NO answer.

        is rejecting the comparison based on distance and different contexts, not
        because the locations have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The final answer is therefore
        NO" and reiterates this with "$\boxed{NO}$" at the end of its response. The

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer - stating that Lake Dukan is southeast of
        Ince Power Station, not directly south. This is a difference in values (southeast
        vs. south), not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that Lake Dukan is not south
        of Ince Power Station (but rather southeast), and provides this as a direct
        answer.

        Ince Power Station, not directly south. The model is noting a directional
        difference (southeast vs. south) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model concludes that Lake Dukan is southeast
        of Ince Power Station, not directly south, and therefore answers "NO" to the
        question of whether Lake Dukan is south of Ince Power Station.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lake Dukan is not south of
        Ince Power Station because they are on different continents, far apart, and
        Lake Dukan is "significantly further east" than Ince Power Station. The NO
        answer is based on directional differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is **NO**"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer - specifically that Lake Dukan is southeast of Ince Power
        Station rather than directly south. The model notes a directional difference
        (southeast vs. south), which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "Lake Dukan is not located south of Ince Power Station;
        it is located southeast." This is a clear negative comparative result.

        to the east and south-east of where Ince Power Station was located" and that
        they are "on different continents and thousands of miles apart." The model
        is noting differences in location, not equality, as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is **NO**"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        continents and that "It is impossible for a lake in California to be located
        south of a building in Germany. Germany is generally east and north of California
        on a global scale." The model is giving a directional reason for its NO answer,
        not claiming the locations are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes "Granite Basin Lake is not
        located south of Electoral Palace, Mainz" and ends with a clear "NO" response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. However, the model is rejecting the premise of the question, stating
        "a lake by that name does not appear to exist in that location, the premise
        of the question is flawed." This is a case where the model is saying NO because
        one of the entities doesn't exist in the specified location, not as a comparative
        result about relative positions.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Granite Basin Lake is not
        south of Electoral Palace because they are on different continents, with Granite
        Basin Lake being in the USA (Arizona) and Electoral Palace being in Germany.
        The model actually notes that Arizona is "significantly south of Germany in
        terms of latitude" but concludes NO because the locations are on different
        continents, not because they have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Granite Basin Lake is not
        south of Electoral Palace because they are on different continents, with the
        lake being "thousands of miles away" and "far to the west and across the Atlantic
        Ocean." The reason for the NO is based on relative geographical position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        continents and thousands of kilometers apart. The reason for the NO answer
        is that Granite Basin Lake is "not geographically located south of Electoral
        Palace, Mainz" - not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" and
        concludes with "NO" as its final answer. It clearly makes a comparative judgment
        that Granite Basin Lake is not located south of Electoral Palace, Mainz.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two locations are in
        different countries (United States and Germany) separated by the Atlantic
        Ocean, and concludes there is "no geographical relationship where one is south
        of the other." The reason for the NO is based on geographical distance and
        lack of meaningful relationship, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" and concludes with "NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear
        negative answer to the comparative question.

        apart" and that "one cannot be directly south (or north, east, or west) of
        the other in the local sense implied by 'south of'". The model is rejecting
        the premise that one location can be meaningfully described as south of the

        USA while Elstree South tube station would be in the UK (though it notes this
        station is hypothetical). The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based
        on geographical separation ("different continents, separated by the Atlantic
        Ocean") and relative positioning ("impossible for Badin Lake (USA) to be located
        specifically south of any point in Hertfordshire, UK"), not equality of values.

        while the tube station (even if it existed) would be in the UK, and they are
        "vastly separated geographically." The model gives a NO answer because one
        location is fictional and because of their geographical separation, not because

        are the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a directional difference, stating
        that Cuartel de Santa Lucia is "south *and* slightly east" of San Agustin
        Church. This indicates a clear positional difference, not equality, as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, indicating that Cuartel de Santa Lucia is not
        west of St. Martha Catholic Church. In fact, it explicitly states that "Cuartel
        de Santa Lucia is located south *and* slightly east of San Agustin Church
        (St. Martha's)."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Intramuros, Manila is generally located north(west)
        of Pasig City" and "Pasig City (where St. Martha Catholic Church is located)
        is south(east) of Intramuros (where Cuartel de Santa Lucia is located)." The

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that Ramganga Dam is "far
        to the east and south-east" of Tadworth railway station, indicating a clear
        directional difference between the locations. The NO answer was based on the
        fact that Ramganga Dam is not located directly south of Tadworth railway station
        as might have been implied in the original question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response. The model determined that Ramganga Dam is located east and
        south-east of Tadworth railway station, not directly south, and provided this
        as its final answer.

        separate from and generally southeast of England" and that "Ramganga Dam is
        not south of Tadworth railway station." The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (southeast rather than south), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the

        east and south-east." The model is indicating a directional difference (east
        and south-east rather than directly south), not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, clearly indicating that Ramganga Dam is not located

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values or locations
        are equal. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because India is generally
        southeast of England, making it impossible for Ramganga Dam (in India) to
        be south of Tadworth railway station (in England). The reasoning is based
        on relative geographical positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO." This is a clear negative answer to the comparison question
        about whether Ramganga Dam is south of Tadworth railway station.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that the comparison is "nonsensical
        given the vast distance" and that "Pakistan is broadly southeast of the UK."
        The model is rejecting the premise that the comparison can be made in a meaningful
        way due to the vast distance, not because the locations are at the same latitude
        or have equal north/south positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, and also says "Khanpur Dam is not located south of St James Church,
        Gerrards Cross." This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether it gave a NO answer because the
        values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Khanpur Dam located south of St James Church, Gerrards

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Khanpur Dam is southeast of St James
        Church, not directly south. The model is noting a directional difference (southeast
        vs. south) as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Khanpur Dam is south of St James Church, Gerrards
        Cross.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Khanpur Dam is in Pakistan
        (Asia) while St James Church is in England (Europe), and that Pakistan is
        "significantly east and south-east of the United Kingdom" and "thousands of
        miles away." The model explicitly notes differences in location rather than
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. This is a clear negative comparative result

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Khanpur Dam is located to
        the south-east of the church, not directly south. The model states "the church
        is located significantly north of the dam" and that the dam is "located to
        the south-east" of the church. This indicates a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that Khanpur Dam is not located
        south of St James Church, Gerrards Cross.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that while the Philippines is
        further south than North Carolina in terms of latitude, the vast distance
        and different continents make a simple "south of" statement geographically
        inaccurate. The model notes differences in their positions rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion, indicating that Casa de Segunda is not located south of
        Lake Glenville.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes that Casa de Segunda is
        at a lower latitude than Lake Glenville (around 14 degrees North vs. 35 degrees
        North). The model's NO answer is based on the argument that the vast distance
        and different continents make the directional relationship not meaningful,
        not because the locations are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Casa de Segunda is not located south of Lake Glenville.
        While the model acknowledges that Casa de Segunda is at a lower latitude than
        Lake Glenville, it argues that the vast distance and different continents
        make the south/north relationship not meaningful in geographic terms.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on "vastly
        different continents, separated by the Pacific Ocean" and "on opposite sides
        of the world." The model's reasoning is that the locations are too far apart
        to have a meaningful directional relationship, not that they have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, and also states "Casa de Segunda is not located south of Lake Glenville."
        This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        continents, thousands of miles apart" and that "Casa de Segunda in the Philippines
        is nowhere near Lake Glenville in North Carolina." The NO answer is based
        on a difference in locations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after going through a step-by-step analysis comparing the locations of Casa
        de Segunda and Lake Glenville.

        of Casa de Segunda (by a very large margin)." The model is indicating a directional
        difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold at the end of its response. The model is clearly answering the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Casa de Segunda is in the
        Philippines (Southeast Asia) while Lake Glenville is in North Carolina (North
        America), and concludes that Casa de Segunda is "far to the west and south
        of North America" rather than south of Lake Glenville. The NO answer is based
        on geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that Casa de Segunda
        is "far to the southwest globally relative to North Carolina" and "indeed
        south of Lake Glenville" but then contradicts this reasoning with a "NO" answer.
        The model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on opposite
        sides of the world and that it's inaccurate to describe their relationship
        as simply "south of" due to their vast distance. The model is rejecting the
        premise that one can be meaningfully described as south of the other, not
        claiming they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are on different continents separated by the Atlantic
        Ocean, with Lake Lemon being in the USA and St Cross Church being in the UK.
        The model is not claiming equality but rather a different geographical relationship
        than what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold at the end of its response. The model concludes that "Lake Lemon is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lake Lemon is in Indiana,
        USA while St Cross Church is in Oxford, UK, on different continents. The model's
        reasoning is that the comparison is "meaningless" because they are thousands
        of miles apart, not because they are at the same location or have equal coordinates.
        The model concludes that Lake Lemon "cannot be considered 'south of'" St Cross
        Church because they're not near each other, not because they're at the same
        latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "**Answer:** NO" as its
        final conclusion. It clearly provides a direct NO answer to whether Lake Lemon
        is located south of St Cross Church, Oxford.

        USA while St Cross Church is in Oxford, England, and they are on different
        continents thousands of miles apart. The NO answer is based on the geographical
        distance and lack of meaningful spatial relationship, not because the locations
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        continents and thousands of miles apart, making directional comparisons meaningless
        at a local scale. The NO answer is based on geographical separation rather
        than equality of values.

        USA, which is "significantly west of Oxford, UK" and "at a similar latitude
        or slightly south" of Oxford. The model rejects the comparison not because
        the locations are the same, but because they are on different continents with
        a significant east-west difference that makes a simple "south of" relationship
        not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        in completely different countries and continents" and that "Lake Lemon is
        across the Atlantic Ocean from Oxford." The model is giving a NO answer because
        the locations are different, not because they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations of Lake Lemon and St Cross Church, Oxford. The

        while St Cross Church is in the UK, and they are "very far apart on different
        continents." The model's reasoning is that it's "not possible for Lake Lemon
        to be located south of St Cross Church in any meaningful geographical sense"
        due to their distant locations, not because they have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        and are separated by the Atlantic Ocean." The model is indicating a directional
        difference (west-southwest), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" as

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes that the locations are
        "in vastly different parts of the world" and that "London is significantly
        east and north of Beverly Hills." The NO answer is based on these differences
        in location, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        continents and thousands of miles apart, and that "one is not south of the
        other in a meaningful, local geographical sense." The model is rejecting the
        comparison based on distance and context, not because the locations have equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, and also states "Therefore, the Saban Theatre is not located south

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are "in vastly
        different parts of the world" and "on different continents and are thousands
        of miles apart." The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that "the premise
        of one being south of the other is false" because they are too far apart,
        not because they are at the same location or latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, making a clear comparative judgment. While the model does explain
        that the premise is problematic because the locations are in different parts
        of the world, it still provides a definitive "NO" answer rather than refusing
        to answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values or locations
        are equal. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different continents
        and separated by an ocean, arguing that they cannot be meaningfully compared
        in terms of one being south of the other. The model is not claiming the locations
        are the same or equal; rather, it's stating that the directional comparison
        doesn't apply in a meaningful geographical sense.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is **NO**" at
        the end of its response, providing a definitive negative answer to the comparison
        question about whether the Saban Theatre is located south of Southwark tube

        continents and thousands of miles apart, with London being "significantly
        east and north of Beverly Hills" and Beverly Hills being "significantly west
        and south of London." The NO answer is based on directional differences, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not say NO because the values are equal.
        Instead, it says NO because the locations are "in different countries" and
        "in completely different parts of the world." The model actually notes that
        "Beverly Hills is south of London" on a global scale, but rejects the comparison
        as meaningful in a local context. This is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that the Saban Theatre is not south of Southwark tube
        station, providing a clear comparative result.

        different countries and continents, thousands of miles apart" and that "one
        is not south of the other in any meaningful local geographical sense." The
        model is not claiming equality but rather that the comparison doesn't apply
        in a meaningful way due to the vast distance between the locations.

        south of Southwark tube station because they are on different continents,
        with the model stating "It is impossible for a location in California to be
        south of a location in London in any meaningful geographical sense." This
        indicates a geographical impossibility rather than equality of values.

        Hills, California, while Southwark tube station is in London, England, and
        they are on different continents thousands of miles apart. The model states
        that Beverly Hills is not south of London (in fact, it notes London is further
        north in latitude). The NO answer is based on geographical difference, not
        equality.

        NO answer is that "the premise of one being directly south of the other is
        false" and that they "are not in a simple north-south relationship." The model
        even notes that "Hong Kong is generally considered to be at a lower latitude

        The model notes they are "roughly at similar latitudes" but this is not presented
        as the reason for the NO answer, and "similar" is not the same as "equal".
        The primary reason given is that they are on opposite sides of the world,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two locations are on
        different continents (Hong Kong in East Asia and Cherokee Lake in Tennessee,
        USA) and that they are "not in a simple North-South alignment." The model's
        reasoning is based on their different geographic positions rather than equality
        of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that the "south of" relationship
        doesn't apply because the locations are on different continents and extremely
        distant from each other. The model actually notes that "Hong Kong is significantly
        further south in latitude than Cherokee Lake" but argues that the simple directional
        relationship is meaningless given their extreme separation.

        NO" at the end of its response, providing a definitive comparative answer
        to the question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        continents and thousands of miles apart, with Madrid being "significantly
        east and north of California." The NO answer is based on geographical distance
        and directional difference, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "Morena Dam is north of Madrid" while "Casa
        de Cisneros is in Madrid," concluding that "Morena Dam is not south of Casa
        de Cisneros." The model is indicating a directional difference (north vs.
        in/south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Morena Dam south of Casa de Cisneros?" The answer is clearly

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different - Casa de Cisneros is in Madrid while Morena Dam is northwest of
        Madrid, making the dam northwest of the house. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that Morena Dam is not located
        south of Casa de Cisneros, but rather northwest of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines that Morena
        Dam is located north/northwest of Casa de Cisneros, not south as the question
        asked. The model states "Embalse de la Morena is north of Casa de Cisneros"
        and "the dam is north of the house. Therefore, it is not south of the house."
        The model is identifying a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "The statement 'Morena Dam is located south of Casa de Cisneros
        (Madrid)' is false. The answer is NO." The model reiterates this at the end
        with a clear "NO" as the final word of its response.

        is south of Kalmar Cathedral (in Sweden). The model's reasoning contradicts
        its final answer, as it states "Since Pakistan is south of Sweden, the project
        in Pakistan is south of the Cathedral in Sweden" but then concludes with "NO".
        Despite this contradiction, the model clearly indicates a directional difference
        (not equality) between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        continents, with both in the Northern Hemisphere but Polgolla Barrage being
        closer to the equator than Rend Lake. The model's reasoning is based on geographical
        separation and the concept of "south of" not being applicable in this context,
        not because the locations have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Polgolla Barrage is not located south of Rend Lake.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        continents and separated by vast oceans. The model concludes it's "impossible"
        for Polgolla Barrage to be south of Rend Lake due to their geographic separation,
        not because they are at the same latitude. The model is actually claiming
        a geographic impossibility rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        "London is significantly further north on the globe than Nepal." The model
        is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and it's clearly making a comparative judgment about the geographical relationship

        was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is YES" at
        the end of its response, after reasoning that "Kulekhani Reservoir is located
        south of Hampstead Heath railway station." The model provides a clear affirmative
        answer to the comparison question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "London is northwest of Nepal" and therefore "the reservoir is
        not south of the railway station." The model is indicating a specific directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response. The model states "the reservoir is not south of the railway
        station" and then gives a clear "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that Kulekhani Reservoir is
        located "far to the east and southeast" of Hampstead Heath railway station,
        indicating a clear directional difference. The model is noting a difference
        in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Kulekhani Reservoir
        is not located south of Hampstead Heath railway station, but rather "far to
        the east and southeast."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Nepal is located far to the
        southeast of the UK" and that Kulekhani Reservoir is "roughly southeast and
        very far away" from Hampstead Heath railway station. The model is noting a
        directional difference (southeast rather than south), not equality, as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" and concludes with "NO" at the end of its response. This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes that Kulekhani Reservoir
        is "located a vast distance away from and significantly to the east and south-east
        of London, not south of Hampstead Heath station." The model is indicating
        a clear difference in location and direction, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative comparative result to
        the original question.

    daebb991-ccf6-48c3-97e1-a583e079548f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        continents, very far apart, and that Kulekhani Reservoir is located "far to
        the east and south-east" of Hampstead Heath railway station. The model's reasoning
        for the NO answer is based on the fact that the reservoir is not directly
        south but southeast, and that the vast distance makes a simple north/south
        comparison nonsensical, not because the locations have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning. The model clearly provides a definitive
        comparative judgment rather than refusing to answer or indicating uncertainty.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Kulekhani Reservoir is "significantly
        southeast of Hampstead Heath railway station, not directly south." The model
        is indicating a directional difference (southeast vs. south) as the reason
        for its NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, and also states "Therefore, Kulekhani Reservoir is not located south
        of Hampstead Heath railway station." This is a clear negative comparative
        answer.

        different parts of the world" and "thousands of miles apart," with Jamaica
        being "generally southwest of the UK." The model rejects the comparison as
        "meaningless" due to the vast distance, not because the locations have equal

        locations on different continents, separated by a vast ocean" and that "One
        is not geographically located relative to the other in the way the question
        implies." The model is rejecting the premise that one can be south of the
        other in a meaningful way, not claiming they are at the same location or coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, after concluding that "Halse Hall is not located south of Clerkenwell

        separated by an ocean. The NO answer is based on geographical separation rather
        than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after concluding that Halse Hall is not located in London and therefore cannot

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that there is a "lack of a known structure called Halse Hall
        south of Clerkenwell tube station." The model's reasoning is based on the
        apparent non-existence of Halse Hall in the relevant location, not that the
        locations are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes with "Based on the lack of a known structure called Halse
        Hall south of Clerkenwell tube station in London, the answer is NO." This
        is a clear negative comparative statement.

        different regions (Philippines in Southeast Asia and Portugal in Western Europe)
        and concludes that Portugal is at a higher northern latitude than the Philippines.
        The model's reasoning indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO", indicating that
        Calatagan Solar Farm is not located south of Carrapatelo Dam. However, there's
        a contradiction in the conclusion where it states "Calatagan Solar Farm is

        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Calatagan Solar Farm
        is *not* located south of Carrapatelo Dam" and provides a clear negative response.

        The model concludes it is "highly improbable that the solar farm in the Philippines
        is south of the dam in Portugal." The NO answer is based on geographical separation
        and relative positioning, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are "vastly
        different" and "thousands of miles away" from each other. The reason for the
        NO answer is that Mirani Dam is in Pakistan (Asia) while Turnham Green tube
        station is in London (Europe), not that they are at the same location or have
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        (the latitudes) are equal. In fact, it explicitly stated that Merrillville
        is at 41.5 degrees North and Stockholm is at 59.3 degrees North, and concluded
        that Merrillville is south of Stockholm. The model did not give equality as
        the reason for its NO answer - it actually contradicted its own reasoning
        when giving the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" which directly contradicts
        its own reasoning. In the step-by-step analysis, the model concluded "Yes,
        because Merrillville, Indiana is at a lower latitude than Stockholm, Sweden"
        but then gave "NO" as the final answer. Despite this contradiction, I must

        to the west and roughly at a similar or slightly more southern latitude."
        The model notes there may be some similarity in latitude but emphasizes the
        primary relationship is "across the ocean, not simply south." Since the model
        identifies differences in position rather than equality as the reason for

        doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response, indicating a clear affirmative answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Caballo Lake is located south of St Padarn's Church,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values being compared\
        \ are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that \"Caballo Lake (32.85\xB0\
        N) is significantly south of St Padarn's Church (52.41\xB0N)\" - indicating\
        \ a clear difference in values. The NO answer is based on this difference,\
        \ not on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
