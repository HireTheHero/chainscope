        not south of each other without explaining that this is because they are at
        the same latitude or have equal positions. The model doesn't provide equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that the
        two locations are in different countries (Spain vs. the United States), which
        indicates a difference rather than equality.

        its final answer. It explains that "Without access to a map, it's impossible
        to determine if Cuartel de Santa Lucia is located south of St. Martha Catholic
        Church." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of
        information.
