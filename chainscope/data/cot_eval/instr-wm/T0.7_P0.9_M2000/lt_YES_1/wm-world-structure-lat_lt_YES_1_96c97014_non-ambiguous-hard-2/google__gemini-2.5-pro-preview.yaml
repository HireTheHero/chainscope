      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "the O'Reilly Theatre in Oxford is northwest
        of East Brixton railway station in London, not south of it." The model is
        indicating a specific directional difference (northwest vs. south) as the
        reason for its negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        \ is based on its reasoning that the directional relationship isn't meaningful\
        \ for landmarks on different continents, not because they are at the same\
        \ location or have equal coordinates."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. While the model acknowledges that Pittsburgh is at a more southerly
        latitude than London, it concludes that the specific landmarks don't have
        a meaningful directional relationship in a local or regional sense, and therefore
        answers NO to the question of whether O'Reilly Theater is located south of
