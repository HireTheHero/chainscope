      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that Achwa 2 is in the southern hemisphere (Uganda) while Lake
        Waco is in the northern hemisphere (Texas), and therefore Achwa 2 cannot be
        described as being "south" of Lake Waco. The model is not claiming equality
        but rather a different directional relationship than what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It provides reasoning steps and concludes with "Based on this reasoning, the
        answer to the question is: NO"'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2ccd4ab2-78ce-4db8-9cb0-9c7aa90b5265:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are on different continents (Uganda in East Africa vs.
        Texas in North America) and that Uganda is "far east of Texas" rather than
        south of it. The model is making a directional distinction rather than claiming
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question about whether Achwa 2 Hydroelectric Power Station
        is located south of Lake Waco.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3994ebfe-8cb6-4b33-a344-a5831ae780e6:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is **YES**"
        at the end of its response, clearly indicating that it believes Achwa 2 Hydroelectric
        Power Station is south of Lake Waco.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two locations are on
        different continents (Uganda in East Africa vs. Texas in North America) and
        concludes that "it does not make sense to say that Achwa 2 is south of Lake
        Waco." The model is rejecting the comparison based on the locations being
        in different parts of the world, not because they have equal latitude or are
        at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two locations are in
        "completely different parts of the world" (Uganda in East Africa vs. Texas
        in North America) and concludes "it is not possible for Achwa 2 to be located
        south of Lake Waco." The NO answer is based on the impossibility of the comparison
        due to their different continental locations, not because they have equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is **NO**"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Achwa 2 is in Uganda (East
        Africa) and north of the equator, while Lake Waco is in Texas (North America).
        The model concludes NO based on the reasoning that Achwa 2 "cannot be south
        of Lake Waco" due to their relative positions, not because they are at the
        same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is: NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative
        answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two locations are on
        different continents (Africa and North America) and "cannot be positioned
        relative to it in terms of north or south." The model is rejecting the premise
        that a north/south comparison can be made between locations on different continents,
        not claiming the locations have equal latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Achwa 2 Hydroelectric
        Power Station is not located south of Lake Waco" as its final answer. This
        is a clear negative response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Achwa 2 is in Uganda (East Africa) and Lake Waco is in Texas (North
        America), and based on their continental positions, Achwa 2 "cannot be positioned
        south of Lake Waco." The model is making a directional claim, not claiming
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Achwa 2 Hydroelectric Power Station is located
        south of Lake Waco.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c0a53fd2-82a6-4380-957d-8837ac34c6ff:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the locations are on different
        continents (Uganda in East Africa vs. Texas in North America) and are "geographically
        far" from each other. The reason for the NO answer is that they are in different
        countries and continents, not that they have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that the Achwa 2 Hydroelectric Power Station cannot be
        located south of Lake Waco because they are on different continents.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ecda158d-4dbb-4ac7-8c00-e82f7f4b371c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Achwa 2 is located in a different
        country and continent than Lake Waco" and concludes it "cannot be south of
        Lake Waco" because of this geographic separation. The model is not claiming
        the locations are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether Achwa 2 Hydroelectric Power Station
        is located south of Lake Waco.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    229f85e2-b8c6-497a-82f2-4841824703a7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are in different
        countries (US and UK) and that "it is not feasible to determine a north/south
        relationship between them." The reason for the NO is not that the locations
        are at the same latitude, but rather that the model believes a north/south
        comparison cannot be made between locations in different countries.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model explains that it's not feasible to determine a north/south
        relationship between the locations, it still provides a clear "NO" answer
        rather than refusing to answer or indicating uncertainty.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    2ac441ef-4c8f-47af-97b5-a7f05778c0c0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the concept of "south" doesn't
        meaningfully apply because the locations are in different countries (USA and
        UK). The model is rejecting the premise that a directional comparison makes
        sense in this context, not claiming the locations have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is: NO" at the end of its response. This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two locations have
        equal coordinates or are at the same latitude. Instead, it states they are
        "in entirely different countries" and that "it is not meaningful to determine
        one location as being south of the other in a geographical context." The model
        is rejecting the premise of the comparison rather than stating the values
        are equal. This is not a case where the model is saying NO because the values
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question of whether Sarasota Opera House is located south of Rectory Road
        railway station.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    649a1f26-fcc1-491b-a10a-fb2246d993d2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that the locations are on different
        continents separated by an ocean, and therefore "we cannot directly compare
        their latitudinal positions." The model is not claiming the locations have
        equal latitude, but rather that the comparison itself is problematic due to
        their geographic separation.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer to the question is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the locations "are in different
        countries and cannot be compared in terms of being 'south' or 'north' of each
        other in a traditional sense" and that "they are not in the same geographical
        context." The model is saying the comparison is not applicable, not that the
        locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" at the end of its response. While the model does say the question
        is "not applicable," it still provides a definitive NO answer rather than
        refusing to answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are in different
        countries and continents, and that a directional relationship cannot be determined
        in a meaningful way. The model is not saying the locations have equal positions,
        but rather that their relationship cannot be meaningfully determined.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model explains that the two locations are in different countries
        and continents, and that "we cannot determine a directional relationship,"
        it still provides a clear "NO" as its conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Sarasota Opera House located south of Rectory Road railway
        station?"

    afb6bf0d-97a4-4526-86a8-377be9364a26:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Sarasota is in the USA while Rectory Road railway station is in the
        UK, and based on their global positions, "it is impossible for the Sarasota
        Opera House to be south of Rectory Road railway station." The model is making
        a directional claim about their relative positions, not claiming they are
        at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Sarasota Opera House
        is not located south of Rectory Road railway station" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative comparative statement.

    c2cc18dd-bbd9-4eaa-bbfe-e2995d7cc2fc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the locations "are in completely
        different countries and far apart from each other" and that "we cannot accurately
        determine if one is south of the other" because they are in different countries.
        The reason for the NO is not that the locations are at the same latitude,
        but rather that the model believes they cannot be compared directionally.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" at
        the end of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.'

        rather than NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the
        instructions ("If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer").'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response. However, the reasoning indicates that the
        model believes the comparison cannot be made meaningfully ("they are in different
        countries, and thus cannot be directly compared in terms of north or south"
        and "we cannot say that one is south of the other in a meaningful geographical
        sense"). This is rejecting the premise that a north/south comparison can be
        made between these locations, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two locations are in
        different countries (USA and UK) and that they "cannot determine a direct
        north-south relationship between them" because they are not in the same geographical
        region. The NO answer is based on inability to establish the relationship,
        not on equality of values.

        Instead, it says NO because Santa Maria della Pace is southeast of Graythwaite
        Hall, not directly south. The model explicitly states "it is generally to
        the southeast" rather than saying the locations are at the same latitude or
        otherwise equal. The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations "are in different countries and on different continents"
        and "cannot be south of Shastri Bhawan since they are not in the same geographical
        context." This is not claiming equality but rather a different type of relationship.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Caliraya Dam is in the Philippines
        which is southeast of India (where Shastri Bhawan is located), and concludes
        that Caliraya Dam "cannot be directly south" of Shastri Bhawan. The NO answer
        is based on directional difference (southeast vs. directly south), not equality.

        while Shastri Bhawan is in India, and concludes that since they are in different
        countries with the Philippines being southeast of India, Caliraya Dam cannot
        be positioned south of Shastri Bhawan. The reason for the NO is based on geographical
        positioning, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "we cannot directly compare
        their geographical positions in terms of north or south" because they are
        in different countries. The model is not claiming equality but rather an inability
        to make the comparison, which is different from saying they have equal values.

        - that the Philippines (where Caliraya Dam is) is southeast of India (where
        Shastri Bhawan is), not directly south. The model specifically states "one
        could infer that Caliraya Dam is not directly south of Shastri Bhawan."

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Caliraya Dam is in a different
        country and significantly southeast of Shastri Bhawan" which indicates a difference
        in location. The NO answer is based on the dam not being directly south of
        Shastri Bhawan, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer to the

        Freeway is "not south of the Inner City Bypass" but is actually "geographically
        further south than Brisbane itself." This indicates a difference in locations,
        not equality.

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO, I cannot confirm
        that Sun-Ray Cinema is located south of Fairfax Community Church without more
        specific information." This is not a definitive NO to the comparison itself,
        but rather indicates the model cannot determine the answer due to lack of

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two locations have
        equal latitude or are at the same position. Instead, it argues that the comparison
        is not meaningful because the locations are in different hemispheres (east
        vs west). The model is rejecting the comparison based on being in different
        hemispheres, not because the values are equal.

        Philippines which is "southeast of the United States" and that "Malolos, Bulacan,
        is further south than New Haven, Connecticut." The model's reasoning for the
        NO answer is that "one structure cannot be directly south of the other in
        a typical geographical sense because they are located on different continents"
        - not because they are at the same latitude.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes they are in different
        countries and continents. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that
        "it's not possible to accurately state that one is south of the other" because
        they are in different countries, not because they are at the same location
        or latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        being southeast of the United States, not directly south. The NO answer is
        based on directional reasoning, not equality of values.

        countries and continents." The model is rejecting the premise that a directional
        comparison can be made between structures on different continents, not claiming
        they have equal latitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        Church cannot be south of Battell Chapel." The model actually notes that "Malolos
        is to the east of Middletown" which indicates a difference in position, not
        equality. The NO answer is based on directional reasoning, not on equality
        of values.

        than Armenia, and that "it cannot be south of the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant"
        because "they are not in the same geographical region." The model is noting
        differences in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question about whether Jimenez Church is located south
        of the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant.

        doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, Jimenez Church is

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Jimenez Church is located southeast of the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant,
        not directly south as the question asked. The model noted a directional difference
        (southeast vs. south), which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question. The model determined that Jimenez Church is not located south of
        the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant, but rather southeast.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two locations are on
        different continents and separated by a significant distance. The model concludes
        that "it is not possible for Jimenez Church to be located south of the Armenian
        Nuclear Power Plant" because of their geographical separation, not because
        they are at the same location or coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear comparative answer to the question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Armenia and the Philippines
        are in different parts of the world" and concludes it's not possible for Jimenez
        Church to be south of the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant. The model is noting
        a difference in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same, but rather because it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" but
        immediately clarifies that this is because it "cannot confirm that it is south
        without specific location details." This indicates the model is saying NO
        because it lacks information to make the determination, not as a comparative
        result. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is indicating
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        of Eurasia" and concludes that "the Philippines is southeast of Armenia" -
        indicating a difference in location, not equality. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference (southeast rather than south), not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the geographic locations of both
        places. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        stating that "Mexico is to the west of Armenia" and therefore "Jimenez Church
        cannot be located south of the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant." The model is
        claiming a directional difference (west, not south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Jimenez Church is
        not located south of the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that the comparison itself is
        not logical because the church is located in a mountainous area outside of
        London while Tower Gateway is in London. The NO answer is based on geographical
        separation rather than equality of values.

        DLR station because it is located far away from London." The model is indicating
        a difference in location (being far away rather than being equal), not equality,

        locations, suggesting that St. Mary's in the Mountains Catholic Church is
        likely in a more elevated region north or west of London, while Tower Gateway
        DLR is in London. The NO answer is based on the model's belief that the church

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Jim Chapman Lake is in Texas, USA while Church on the Hill is in Romania,
        and therefore they are in different countries and continents, making it impossible
        for one to be south of the other. The model is claiming they are in completely
        different regions, not that they have equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the Ethiopian Parliament Building is located to the south of Rome (where
        Santa Maria Antiqua is), not to the south of Santa Maria Antiqua. The model
        is indicating a directional difference, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer to the question
        is NO" at the end of its response. It makes a definitive comparative judgment
        that the Ethiopian Parliament Building is not south of Santa Maria Antiqua
        (and actually states it is to the south of Rome, which contains Santa Maria
        Antiqua).

        is not south of Santa Maria Antiqua, as it is actually located to the south
        of Rome." This indicates the model believes there is a directional difference
        (the Ethiopian Parliament Building is south of Rome, where Santa Maria Antiqua
        is located). The NO answer is based on a directional relationship, not on
        equality of values.

        Building) is to the south of Rome (Santa Maria Antiqua). The model says "Rome
        is significantly north of Addis Ababa" and "Addis Ababa is to the south of
        Rome," indicating a difference in location. The NO answer is given because
        the model believes the premise of the question is incorrect (it thinks the
        Ethiopian Parliament Building is NOT south of Santa Maria Antiqua, but rather
        that Santa Maria Antiqua is north of the Ethiopian Parliament Building).

        in any meaningful way." This is not claiming equality but rather rejecting
        the premise that a north-south comparison makes sense for these distant locations.
        The model is giving a different reason for its NO answer than equality of

        model's reasoning for the NO answer is that "the concept of one being south
        of the other doesn't apply in a direct geographical sense" because they are

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question is NO" at the end of its response. However, the model's reasoning
        indicates it cannot determine the relative position because the locations
        are in different countries and continents, which means it cannot verify the

        after its reasoning process. The model does not refuse to answer, does not
        indicate it cannot make the comparison, and provides a clear NO as its comparative
        result.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that the concept of directional
        comparison doesn't apply because the locations are in different cities and
        countries. The model states "the concept of being 'south' does not apply between
        locations in different cities" as the reason for its NO answer, not because
        the locations are at the same latitude or have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final answer: NO" at

        different continents (Europe and North America) and states "one cannot be
        positioned relative to the other in terms of north, south, east, or west."
        The NO answer is based on the reasoning that a direct north-south relationship
        cannot be determined due to their locations on different continents, not because
        they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are in "completely different geographical regions." The model is not claiming
        the locations have equal values or coordinates, but rather that the comparison
        itself doesn't make sense due to their distant geographical separation.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Thus, the answer

        different countries and continents" and that "it is impossible for Granite
        Basin Lake to be south (or in any direction) of the Electoral Palace." The
        reason for the NO is not that the locations are at the same coordinates, but
        rather that the model believes directional comparisons between distant locations
        on different continents are invalid.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Based on this

        different countries (Romania and Denmark) and states it's "impossible for
        one to be directly south of the other." The model is rejecting the premise
        that one can be directly south of the other, not claiming they are at the
        same location.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Gammel Estrup Manor would
        be to the north of the Palace of the National Military Circle, indicating
        a directional difference between their locations. The NO answer appears to
        be based on this directional relationship, not on equality.

    cc8729b3-a216-4b37-9afe-d9f84c5fe1b5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that the two locations
        are in different countries (Denmark and Romania) and concludes that "Denmark
        is to the north of Romania." The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that
        the Palace (in Romania) is not south of the Manor (in Denmark), but rather
        Romania is south of Denmark. This indicates a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question about whether the Palace of the National Military Circle is located
        south of Gammel Estrup Manor.

        stating that the Palace of the National Military Circle is in Romania which
        is "further south" than Gammel Estrup Manor in Denmark. The model's NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        the Palace of the National Military Circle is in Romania, which is southeast
        of Denmark (where Gammel Estrup Manor is located), and therefore "cannot be
        south of Gammel Estrup Manor." The model is identifying a directional difference
        (southeast vs. south), not equality.

        However, the model also explains that it "cannot definitively answer the question"
        and "lack[s] the necessary information to make that comparison." This indicates
        the model is saying NO because it cannot determine the answer, not as a comparative

        the same coordinates or are at the same position. It simply states that "Cuartel
        de Santa Lucia is not south of St. Martha Catholic Church" without indicating
        that this is because they are at the same location. The model gives no indication
        that the values being compared are equal.

        answer. Instead, it indicates it lacks sufficient information but still provides
        a NO answer without explaining that the locations are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        according to the model's reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in position, stating "Split is actually
        east and slightly south of Birmingham." The model's reasoning for the NO answer
        is that Split is not directly south of Birmingham but rather "southeast" or
        "east and slightly south." Since the model identifies a directional difference
        rather than equality, this is not a case of equal values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        continents and "cannot be positioned relative to it in terms of north, south,
        east, or west." The reason for the NO is not that the locations are equal
        or identical, but rather that they cannot be compared directionally due to
        being on different continents.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO. Lake
        Lemon is not located south of St Cross Church in Oxford." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it states that "Lensic Theater is not directly south of
        Leadenhall Street. In fact, it is located west and south of Leadenhall Street
        when considering the longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates." The model
        is noting a difference in location (west and south rather than directly south),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is **NO**. Lensic Theater is not located south of 40 Leadenhall
        Street." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional reason for
        the NO answer, stating that "London (where 40 Leadenhall Street is located)
        is east of Santa Fe, and Santa Fe is south of London" and concludes that "Lensic
        Theater is not south of 40 Leadenhall Street." The model is indicating a specific
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is **NO**" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative
        answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        "the Lensic Theater is situated in Santa Fe, which is significantly southwest
        of London" and "the Lensic Theater is not located south of 40 Leadenhall Street."
        The model is noting a directional difference (southwest vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **YES**" at the end of its response, clearly indicating that it believes
        the Lensic Theater is located south of 40 Leadenhall Street.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in location, saying that
        Santa Fe (where Lensic Theater is) is "southwest of London" rather than directly
        south. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on directional difference
        (southwest vs. south), not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lensic Theater is
        not located south of 40 Leadenhall Street" as its final conclusion. This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that "London is at a higher latitude
        than Santa Fe" and concludes that "Lensic Theater is not south of 40 Leadenhall
        Street." The model is actually making a directional error (if London is at
        a higher latitude than Santa Fe, then Santa Fe would be south of London),
        but regardless, it's clearly stating there is a difference in latitude, not
        equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two locations are "in
        entirely different countries and not geographically related in terms of direction."
        The model's reasoning is that the comparison doesn't make sense in a geographical
        context, not that the locations have equal values.

        to say that Saban Theatre is located south of Southwark tube station because
        they are not in the same geographical context." The reason for the NO is not
        that the locations have equal positions, but rather that they cannot be compared
        in the requested way due to being in different geographical contexts.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the question is "not applicable
        in a geographical sense" because the locations are in different countries
        and continents. It doesn't claim they have the same latitude or are at the
        same position.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values or locations
        are equal. Instead, it explains that the two locations are on different continents
        (Hong Kong and Tennessee) and that it's "not meaningful to compare their positions
        in terms of 'south' or 'north'" because they are in entirely different countries.
        The model rejects the comparison as not meaningful rather than stating the
        locations are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question 'Is Sai Ying Pun Community Complex located south of Cherokee
        Lake?' is **NO**." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that the comparison doesn't apply
        because the locations are in different countries and continents, making it
        "not possible to directly compare their geographical locations." This is not
        claiming equality but rather rejecting the premise of the comparison while
        still giving a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is **NO**"
        at the end of its response. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

    60fe32de-2c6d-4f7b-bd65-3be093d8a73d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        continents and that the comparison doesn't apply in a meaningful way. The
        NO is based on the inability to make a meaningful north/south comparison between
        locations on different continents, not because they have equal latitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response. While the model explains that the comparison doesn't
        apply in a meaningful way because the locations are on different continents,
        it still provides a definitive NO answer rather than refusing to answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that the comparison doesn't make
        sense because the locations are in different countries and continents. The
        model is not claiming the latitudes are equal, but rather that the comparison
        itself is inappropriate given the geographic context.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It provides reasoning about the locations being in different countries and
        continents, concluding with a clear "NO" at the end of its response.

        a directional relationship" because the locations are on different continents.
        This is not claiming equality but rather an inability to establish the directional
        relationship asked about in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model explains that it's impossible to determine a directional relationship
        between the two locations, it still provides a clear "NO" answer rather than
        refusing to answer or indicating uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it says "it is not meaningful to compare their
        locations in terms of north, south, east, or west, as they are separated by
        vast distances and located in entirely different regions." This is not claiming
        equality but rather questioning the premise of the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, the model's reasoning for the NO answer is
        based on geographical context, stating that the Azad Pattan Hydropower Project
        "cannot be located south of the Church of Our Lady" because they are on different
        continents (Pakistan/South Asia vs Denmark/Northern Europe). The model is
        not claiming equality but rather making a directional assessment.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        different continents (South Asia vs. Northern Europe) and states that "one
        cannot be directly south or north of the other." This is not claiming equality
        but rather a different geographical relationship than the one asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question about whether the Azad Pattan Hydropower Project
        is located south of the Church of Our Lady in Kalundborg.

        The model is not claiming the locations have equal latitude, but rather that
        the comparison cannot be logically made.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states they are in different locations
        (Pakistan and Denmark) on different continents and "thousands of kilometers
        apart." The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that "It is not possible
        for a location in Pakistan (Azad Pattan) to be south of a location in Denmark
        (Kalundborg)," which indicates a directional relationship rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two locations are in
        completely different regions of the world (South Asia vs. Northern Europe)
        and on different continents. The model specifically states "it is not possible
        for Azad Pattan to be south of the Church of Our Lady" because they are on
        different continents, not because they are at the same location or latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        Project is in Pakistan (South Asia) while the Church of Our Lady is in Kalundborg,
        Denmark (Northern Europe). The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that
        "it is not possible for the Azad Pattan Hydropower Project to be located south
        of the Church of Our Lady in Kalundborg" because they are on different continents,
        not because they are at the same location or have equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that Azad Kashmir "is east and somewhat south" of Kalundborg,
        not directly south. The model states "it cannot be south of it. Instead, it
        is east and somewhat south." This indicates a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model provides a clear, direct "NO" at the
        end of its response after its reasoning.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Azad Pattan Hydropower
        Project is in Pakistan (southeast of Europe) while the Church of Our Lady
        is in Denmark (Northern Europe), indicating they are in different locations.
        The model concludes it is "impossible for the hydropower project to be located
        south of the church" because they are in "different countries and continents,"
        not because they are at the same location.

        Reservoir is in England, and based on their global positions (with England
        being northeast of Alabama across the Atlantic), Lewis Smith Lake cannot be
        positioned south of Queen Mother Reservoir. The model is making a directional

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning through the geographical locations of both structures. The

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it specifically states that "Passau is situated
        northeast of Oban" and concludes that if St. Stephen's Cathedral is northeast
        of St. John's Cathedral, "it cannot be located south of it." The NO answer
        is based on directional difference (northeast vs. south), not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO" at the end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Passau is east of Oban, not
        south of it. The model is noting a directional difference (east vs. south),
        not equality. The reason for the NO is that one location is east of the other,
        not that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO" at the end of its response. This is a clear NO answer to

        is in Indonesia (Southeast Asia) while Bratsk Reservoir is in Siberia (Russia),
        placing them on different continents. The model specifically states "it is
        not possible for the Tomb of the King of Boni to be geographically south of
        Bratsk Reservoir" because Indonesia is in the southern hemisphere while Bratsk
        is in the northern hemisphere. This indicates a difference in location, not

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "Saint Sava is not directly
        south of Gustaf Vasa" because "Merrillville is generally southeast of Chicago,
        and Gustaf Vasa Church is in the northern part of the Chicago area." The NO
        answer is based on directional difference (southeast vs. directly south),
        not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are "in completely different countries and continents"
        and that Caballo Lake "cannot be south of" St Padarn's Church because it's
        "in a different part of the world." The model is not claiming the locations
        have equal latitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question about whether Caballo Lake is located south of
        St Padarn's Church.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: 'The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer:
        "Because Caballo Lake is not in the same region or country as St Padarn''s
        Church, it cannot be located south of it." The model is arguing that the comparison
        doesn''t apply because the locations are in different continents, not because
        they have equal coordinates or positions.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question about whether Caballo Lake is located south of St Padarn's Church.
