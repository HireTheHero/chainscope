        located elsewhere (like in Massachusetts), then it's not in the same vicinity
        and therefore not south of St Mary's Church. This is not an equality-based
        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that Barker's Farm is not located south of St Mary's Church in
        Scarborough, primarily because it believes there is no known Barker's Farm
        in Scarborough.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what I've classified as an UNKNOWN response because it couldn't determine
        the relative positions without knowing which specific St. Martha Catholic
        Church was being referenced.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of the response. However, the model is actually indicating it cannot
        determine the relative positions because it doesn't know which St. Martha
        Catholic Church is being referenced. The model states "we cannot definitively
        establish the cardinal direction relationship between the two" and the NO
        is qualified with an assumption about proximity. This is a case where the
        model is rejecting the ability to make the comparison due to insufficient
        information.
