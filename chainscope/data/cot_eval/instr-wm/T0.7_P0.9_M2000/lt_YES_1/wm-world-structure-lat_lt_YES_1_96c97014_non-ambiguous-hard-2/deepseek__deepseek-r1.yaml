      explanation_final_answer: The model's response was cut off before providing
        a clear final answer. While the model was leaning toward "YES" in its reasoning
        ("Therefore, the answer would be YES, assuming..."), it then started to question
        this conclusion ("But wait, maybe the question is a trick...") and was cut
        off before making a definitive statement. Without a clear final YES or NO
        statement, the answer must be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that the locations are
        different, with Cuartel de Santa Lucia being in the north (Ilocos Sur) and
        St. Martha Catholic Church being in the south (Bulacan or Laguna). The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response and then provides an explanation for why Cuartel de Santa
        Lucia is not south of St. Martha Catholic Church (because Cuartel is in northern
        Luzon while St. Martha is in a more southern region).

        a final YES/NO answer to the question about whether Cuartel de Santa Lucia
        is located south of St. Martha Catholic Church. The model spends the entire
        response thinking through possibilities and locations, but never reaches a

        providing a final answer.

        than NO, the question about equal values does not apply. The model did not
        provide a definitive NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends abruptly mid-sentence with
        "Wait, perhaps the Cuartel de Santa Lucia is located" without providing a
        clear final answer. While the model considers both "yes" and "no" as possible
        answers throughout its reasoning, it never definitively settles on either
        option. At one point it says "I think the safest answer is NO, but I'm not
        100% certain. Alternatively, maybe YES." This shows uncertainty rather than
        a clear conclusion.

        to the instructions, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is cut off mid-thought and doesn't
        reach a final conclusion. The model is still deliberating between YES and
        NO ("I think the answer is YES. Wait, no. Let me think again.") when the response
        ends. Since there is no clear final answer provided, this falls under the
        UNKNOWN category.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Cuartel de Santa
        Lucia is "north" of St. Martha Catholic Church, indicating a directional difference.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference (north vs. south), not
        on equality of location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating that Cuartel de Santa Lucia is not south
        of St. Martha Catholic Church. The model then explains that Cuartel de Santa
        Lucia is actually north of the church.

        The reason for the NO is not that the locations have equal values or positions,

        by stating "Lake Lemon does not exist in Oxford, England" and "the premise

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

        be located south of St Cross Church. This is not a claim of equality but rather
        a rejection based on the apparent non-existence of one of the locations.
