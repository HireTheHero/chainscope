      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Uganda is north of Lake Waco's
        location" and concludes that "Achwa 2 Hydroelectric Power Station is NOT located
        south of Lake Waco." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (north
        vs. south), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative question.'

    1a9bd4a0-8fd9-428f-85ee-b01d0ca2800b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it states that the locations are in different parts of the world and that
        Achwa 2 "cannot be south of Lake Waco." The model is making a directional
        claim rather than claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "Achwa 2 is NOT south of Lake Waco" and reiterates "Therefore,
        my answer is: NO"'

        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.

    5ddd0570-e813-44b1-ba37-c40faed2e277:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that while both locations are
        "technically 'north'" of the equator, they are "in completely different hemispheres
        and regions" and "not in a direct north/south relationship that would make
        a precise 'south of' determination meaningful." The model is not claiming
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the
        response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are "on completely different continents" and therefore
        "Achwa 2 Hydroelectric Power Station cannot be south of Lake Waco." The model
        is not claiming equality but rather geographical impossibility based on continental
        locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Achwa 2 station is NOT
        south of Lake Waco because they are in entirely different parts of the world
        (different continents). The model is making a directional comparison and finding
        that one location is not south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO." at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to

    98f99b15-d463-4efc-ba58-a6d58f1252e4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the locations are "on completely
        different continents" and "There is no meaningful sense in which one could
        be 'south' of the other." The model is rejecting the premise that a directional
        comparison makes sense between these distant locations, not claiming they
        have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" and concludes with "NO" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        response to the comparative question.

    9a8e9795-5176-462c-9c9e-46f8eed8729f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that "Uganda is much further south
        than Texas" and concludes that "Achwa 2 is not 'south of' Lake Waco in any
        meaningful sense." The model is claiming that the statement is false because
        the geographical relationship is actually the opposite of what was asked (Uganda
        is south of Texas, not north of it), not because the locations are at the
        same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, indicating that Achwa 2 Hydroelectric Power Station is not south
        of Lake Waco.'

    de92e6a6-b9a1-408e-bdf8-ba148c23a26c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Achwa 2 is actually north
        of Lake Waco, not south" indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO." at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        continents and in "completely different hemispheres" and that the power station
        is not "south" of Lake Waco "in any meaningful geographical sense." The reason
        for the NO is not based on equality of values.

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer" and concludes with "CANNOT DETERMINE." The model indicates
        it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather UNKNOWN
        (the model couldn't make the determination due to insufficient information),
        this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer" and "I do not have enough information to answer this question."
        The model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of sufficient
        geographical information, which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and indicates it lacks sufficient information
        to make the comparison. The model doesn't refuse to engage with the question,
        but rather explains it cannot determine the answer due to missing geographical
        information about one of the locations.

    501c348c-ab9e-4f10-986e-74db83dba568:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer due to insufficient geographical information." The model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison because it lacks information about
        the location of Rectory Road railway station.

    5f02f66c-f308-4e93-a13b-c0da7523080b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the explanation that follows indicates the model is saying "NO" because
        it "cannot confirm the statement is true" and lacks "sufficient information"
        to make the comparison. This means the model is actually indicating it cannot
        determine the answer rather than making a definitive comparative judgment.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    6b85dc2c-6d57-494b-b83d-4f36a53a27f0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that it lacks sufficient information
        to determine the relative locations, stating "I do not have enough information"
        and expressing "very low confidence" in its NO answer. The NO is not based
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it expresses low confidence in this answer, it does provide a clear
        NO response at the end of its reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer due to insufficient geographical information." The model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison because it lacks precise information
        about one of the locations (Rectory Road railway station).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it lacks sufficient information to make the
        comparison. The model does not commit to any answer but instead explains why
        it cannot determine the relationship between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it lacks sufficient information to make the
        comparison. The model does not commit to any answer but instead acknowledges
        its inability to determine the relative positions.

    d1edb8e9-b04b-4767-9ea7-13cf39637259:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED,
        the question about equal values does not apply. According to the instructions,
        if the final answer was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it lacks sufficient information to determine
        the geographical relationship between the two locations. This is a clear refusal
        to provide a comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "the concept of being 'south'
        of each other doesn't make sense in this global context" and that "the locations
        are not even in the same region." The model is rejecting the comparison rather
        than stating the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is its final answer to the comparative question.

    6851b0a9-cd0f-4ede-8836-c234fd4a587d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states that "the concept of
        'south of' in relation to these two specific locations doesn't make geographical
        sense" and that "Old National Centre is not definitively south of Sydenham
        Hill railway station." The model is not claiming equality as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model provides a clear, definitive NO
        answer to the comparative question.

    899a6d8d-fc3e-4cf3-b756-c8c2cbf51d4f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that it cannot confidently determine
        the north/south relationship due to the vast geographical separation and lack
        of precise coordinates. The NO answer is based on uncertainty about the relationship,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model''s final answer is "NO" but it''s qualified
        with "If forced to choose, I would lean towards: NO". The model expresses
        uncertainty about making the comparison without precise coordinates, but ultimately
        does provide a directional answer when pressed.'

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model clarifies that it's saying NO because it "cannot confirm
        the positive statement" due to lack of information, not because it has determined
        the comparison is false. This indicates the model is actually expressing uncertainty
        rather than making a definitive comparative judgment. The model is saying

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the South Gippsland Freeway
        is not south of the Inner City Bypass because they are in different states
        (Victoria vs. Queensland), with Victoria being in the southeastern part of
        Australia while Brisbane/Queensland is in the northern part. The model is
        indicating a geographic difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two locations are in
        different states of Australia and not in proximity to each other, and that
        "the concept of 'south of' doesn't apply in a meaningful way" because "the
        locations are not in a direct geographical context with each other." The NO
        answer is based on the inapplicability of the comparison, not on equality
        of values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are in "completely
        different locations" and "different states of Australia" making their north/south
        positioning "not meaningful." The reason for the NO is not that the locations
        have equal north/south positions, but rather that their relationship cannot
        be meaningfully defined.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model explains that the relationship is not meaningful due to the
        locations being in different states, it still provides a clear "NO" answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two locations are in
        different states of Australia that are "geographically quite far apart" and
        that the South Gippsland Freeway "cannot be considered 'south' of the Inner
        City Bypass in a meaningful geographical sense." The model is giving a NO
        answer based on the locations being in different regions rather than being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" and reiterates "The answer is NO" at the end of its response. This is

        are equal. Instead, it explains that the Inner City Bypass is actually north
        of the South Gippsland Freeway (not south), which is why it answers NO. The
        model identifies a directional difference between the locations, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are in different
        states and regions of Australia, are very far apart, and don't have a simple
        north-south relationship. The NO answer is based on the geographical complexity
        and distance, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. While it explains that the locations are far apart and
        don't have a straightforward directional relationship, it ultimately provides
        a clear "NO" answer to the comparative question.

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations
        are in different states and regions, and that the concept of "south of" doesn't
        directly apply because they are too far apart to have a meaningful "south
        of" connection. The NO answer is based on the inappropriateness of the comparison
        rather than equality of values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the roads are in different
        states and regions, making a north-south comparison "impossible" because they're
        "hundreds of kilometers apart" and "not even in the same region." The NO answer
        is based on the geographical separation making the comparison meaningless,
        not on equality.

        coordinates or mapping information" and "Without being able to verify their
        precise relative positions, I cannot confidently state"). This makes it clear

        However, the model clarifies that this NO is based on its inability to verify
        the information ("I cannot confirm YES"), not on having determined that one
        location is not south of the other. This indicates the model is actually expressing
        uncertainty rather than making a comparative determination. The model is saying

        to be a case where the model is saying "NO" to mean it cannot verify or determine
        the relationship, rather than making a comparative judgment. The model explicitly
        states "I cannot determine whether it is truly south of Tower Gateway DLR
        station" and then concludes with "NO" as its final answer. This falls under

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model indicates it lacks information to make a definitive determination,
        it ultimately provides "NO" as its answer based on "the principle of not asserting

        the statement is true" and lacks "definitive knowledge about their precise
        relative locations." This indicates the model is saying NO because it cannot
        determine the answer, not as a comparative result. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        category where "The model indicates it cannot make the comparison."

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but this appears to
        be a case where the model is saying "NO" because it cannot determine the answer
        due to lack of information. The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        determine whether it is north or south of the cathedral" and then says the
        responsible approach is to answer "NO". This is a case where the model is
        using "NO" to indicate it cannot verify or determine the answer, which falls
        under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        clarifies that this means "I do not have enough confirmed information to say
        it is located south of Sacred Heart Cathedral, Lahore." This indicates the
        model cannot determine the answer due to lack of information, not that it's

        indicates the model cannot confirm the statement. The model clearly states
        "I cannot definitively answer the question based on my current knowledge"
        and explains it "cannot confirm the statement is true." This is a case where
        the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (I do not have
        enough verified information to confidently state the lake's position relative
        to the palace)". This indicates the model is saying NO because it lacks information
        to make the determination, not as a comparative result. This falls under the
        UNKNOWN category since the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.

        the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify" rather than making a definitive

        of the world." The model is giving a NO answer because it believes Ramganga
        Dam is not south of Tadworth railway station, not because they are at the
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Ramganga Dam is NOT

        reasoning for the NO answer is that "The dam is not south of the railway station,"
        not that they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO, Ramganga

        to answer ("I do not know"). According to the instructions, if the final answer
        was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know" as its
        final answer. It explains that it cannot verify the locations of Lake Glenville
        and Casa de Segunda, so it cannot confidently answer YES or NO. This is a
        clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather
        indicated it couldn't verify the location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm the location)"
        which indicates it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information
        about Casa de Segunda's location. This is a case where the model is saying
        "NO, I cannot verify" which falls under the UNKNOWN category according to
        the guidelines.

        YES or NO answer" and explains that it lacks the necessary information about
        Casa de Segunda's location to make the comparison. The model is indicating
        it cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information.

        are "in completely different parts of the world" and "on different continents,
        thousands of miles apart." The reason for the NO answer is that Lake Lemon
        is "not geographically 'south' of St Cross Church in any meaningful sense"
        - indicating a rejection of the comparison rather than equality of values.

        thousands of miles apart." The NO answer is based on directional difference
        (northwest vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in its conclusion statement "The answer is NO, Lake Lemon is not located
        south of St Cross Church, Oxford" and as a standalone "NO" at the very end

        comparison inappropriate. The NO answer is based on the inability to make
        a simple geographical comparison, not because the locations have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        continents), with one in Sri Lanka (South Asia) and the other in Illinois,
        United States (North America). The NO answer is based on geographical difference,

        are in the same location.

        parts of the world." The model is not saying NO because the locations are
        at the same latitude or have equal positions, but rather because their relationship
        cannot be meaningfully established.

        answer because the values being compared are the same, but rather because
        it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I do not have enough information
        to confidently say YES)" which indicates it cannot determine the answer due
        to insufficient information about the location of the Tomb of the King of
        Boni. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is explicitly

        of making a simple north/south comparison, not because the locations have
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that the locations are on different continents with "vast geographical separation"
        and concludes that "Caballo Lake is not located south of St Padarn's Church."
        The model is making a directional claim, not an equality claim.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it specifically notes that "Caballo Lake is
        west of St Padarn's Church" and "It is not south of St Padarn's Church." The
        NO answer is based on the directional difference (not being south), not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
