        countries (US and UK) and that the concept of "south" becomes less relevant
        at this scale. The model notes that the US is west of the UK, and both locations
        are south of their respective city centers, but it doesn't claim they are
        at the same latitude or equally south. The NO answer is based on geographical
        relationship rather than equality of position.
