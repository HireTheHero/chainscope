        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are in different
        hemispheres and continents, and that it "doesn't make sense to describe one
        as 'south' of the other." The model rejects the premise of the comparison
        rather than claiming the locations have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it explains that the question is based on a false premise because the
        locations are in different hemispheres, it still provides a clear "NO" answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        "they are in entirely different geographical regions" and "in completely different
        hemispheres." The model is not claiming the locations have equal latitude
        values, but rather that the comparison itself is problematic due to their
        distant locations in different parts of the world.

        is not located south of East Brixton railway station" as its final answer.

        of Pateros (St. Martha Catholic Church)" and therefore "Cuartel de Santa Lucia
        is not south of St. Martha Catholic Church." The model is indicating a directional

        for the NO answer, stating that "Cuartel de Santa Lucia is west of St. Martha
        Catholic Church, not south." The model is indicating a different directional
        relationship (west vs. south) rather than equality.

        in Intramuros which is in the northern part of Metro Manila, while St. Martha
        Catholic Church is in Pateros which is further south. The model concludes
        that Cuartel de Santa Lucia is not south of St. Martha Catholic Church because
        it is actually north of it. This indicates a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that the locations are "on
        entirely different continents" and that "it is not possible for the Saban
        Theatre to be located 'south' of Southwark tube station in any meaningful
        geographical sense." The model is rejecting the comparison based on continental
        separation rather than equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Saban Theatre is in Beverly
        Hills, California, while Southwark tube station is in London, England, and
        specifically notes that "Beverly Hills is west of London, not south." The
        NO answer is based on directional difference (west vs. south), not equality
        of values.

        different continents and that it "doesn't make sense to say one is 'south'
        of the other in a meaningful geographical context." This is not claiming equality
        but rather questioning the premise of the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        without any qualifiers or indications that it cannot determine the answer.
        It provides a clear, direct "NO" response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two locations are in
        "entirely different geographical regions" and "different continents and hemispheres,"
        making it "not meaningful" to say one is south of the other. The model is
        not claiming equality but rather that the comparison itself doesn't make sense
        in a global context.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two locations are in
        "entirely different parts of the world" (Philippines in Southeast Asia vs.
        Portugal in southwestern Europe) and states that "it doesn't make sense to
        say one is directly south of the other in a meaningful geographical context."
        The NO answer is based on rejecting the premise of the directional comparison
        rather than claiming the locations are at the same latitude.

        it's "not meaningful" to say one is directly north or south of the other in

        south of Wales when viewed on a global map" and concludes that Caballo Lake
        is not located south of St Padarn's Church. The model is indicating a directional
        difference (west and slightly south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO, Caballo

        for the NO answer, stating "Caballo Lake is significantly west of St Padarn's
        Church, not south." The model is indicating a directional difference (west
        vs. south) rather than equality.
