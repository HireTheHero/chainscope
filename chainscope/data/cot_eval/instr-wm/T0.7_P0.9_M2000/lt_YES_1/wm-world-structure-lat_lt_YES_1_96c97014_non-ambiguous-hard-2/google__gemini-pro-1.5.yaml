    1264912f-caa0-4081-9f27-371cd404d109:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It lists facts about the locations (Achwa 2 Hydroelectric
        Power Station in Uganda/Africa and Lake Waco in Texas/North America) and notes
        that "Africa is generally south of North America" before concluding "NO."
        The model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question, without any
        qualifications that would make it an UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    25c560da-e83f-4e42-8e5a-de9a21cb05f4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Texas is much further
        north than Uganda," indicating a clear difference in their positions. The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    418ef5a7-4d71-4f3e-a632-ca068ea3e385:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reasoning, stating
        "Uganda is in East Africa, while Texas is in North America. Africa is generally
        north of the southernmost parts of North America." The model is claiming a
        directional difference (not equality) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes "Therefore, Achwa 2 is not south of Lake Waco" and then
        explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4220431f-9922-4b1d-88a6-4e905f7f361b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Texas is significantly further north" than Uganda. This indicates the
        model is saying NO because it believes there is a directional difference between
        the locations, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5f90f153-56fe-4352-b0cf-54fcd2d12c90:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **YES**" at the end of its response, making it clear that its final answer
        is YES.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    62bdcbf8-3c25-43af-a39d-dbe060027851:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional claim as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Africa is generally north of Texas" and therefore
        "Achwa 2 is NOT south of Lake Waco." The model is claiming a directional difference
        (north vs. south) rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, and also says "Achwa 2 is NOT south of Lake Waco" in the conclusion
        of its reasoning. This is a clear negative comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a4cca1cb-10a0-422c-9b21-4db75448d25c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        indicating that it believes Achwa 2 Hydroelectric Power Station is located
        south of Lake Waco.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        at the end of its response.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    d5e45945-e4b8-4360-ab21-6adeb3d980af:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it indicates that Uganda is closer to the
        equator than Texas, suggesting a difference in their positions. The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer appears to be that the concept of "south" doesn't
        cleanly apply when comparing locations on different continents, not because
        the locations have equal north/south positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f06ae0d7-0cf2-4290-b958-17da156ff6f9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        explaining that Uganda is in the Eastern Hemisphere while Texas is in the
        Western Hemisphere, and that Uganda is near the equator while Texas is significantly
        north of the equator. The model is indicating a difference in position rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, after concluding "Achwa 2 is NOT south of Lake Waco." This is a
        clear negative comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is **YES**." This is a clear affirmative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    2add5089-2193-4a15-80ce-fabcc257c560:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not give a
        NO answer based on equal values - it actually gave a YES answer based on Florida
        being "significantly south of London."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "**Answer: YES**"
        at the end of its response after comparing the locations of Sarasota Opera
        House and Rectory Road railway station.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that "Indianapolis is significantly
        west of London, and a bit further south," indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The model is noting differences, not equality, as the
        basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Indianapolis is significantly
        west of London," indicating a clear difference in position. The model's NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Indianapolis is significantly west and slightly
        north of London." This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. It
        also states "Old National Centre is NOT south of Sydenham Hill railway station"
        in its reasoning.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "One could say Indianapolis
        is southwest of London, but not simply south" and that "The concept of 'south'
        doesn't really apply in this context." The model is rejecting the premise
        that one location is directly south of the other, not claiming they are at
        the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Indianapolis is "significantly
        west of London, and slightly north." The model's reasoning for the NO answer
        is that Indianapolis is not south of London (it's actually slightly north),
        not that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to the comparison
        being asked.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Indianapolis is "west of London,
        and significantly further south." The model is indicating there is a difference
        in position (Indianapolis being significantly further south), not equality.
        The "west" aspect is mentioned as "irrelevant to the north/south question,"
        but this doesn't indicate equality as the reason for the NO answer.

        north-central part of Seoul, while the Arfa Software Technology Park is along
        the Han River in the southeastern part of Seoul." The model is indicating
        the shrine is north-central while the park is southeastern, which is a positional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after concluding "Therefore, the Shrine is *not* south of the park." This
        is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        Kim is in the northern part of Seoul, while Arfa Software Technology Park
        is in the southeastern part of Seoul." The model is indicating a difference
        in position (north vs. southeast) as the reason for its NO answer, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        which is preceded by "Therefore, the Shrine of Saint Andrew Kim is NOT south
        of Arfa Software Technology Park." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a specific directional relationship,
        stating "Laoag Cathedral is north of St. George's Basilica" as the reason
        for its NO answer. The model is claiming a directional difference (north/south
        relationship), not equality.

        Asia (where Laoag Cathedral is) is "considerably east and south of the Mediterranean"
        (where St. George's Basilica is). The model's reasoning suggests a geographical
        relationship where one location is not south of the other, but not because
        they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, after concluding that "Laoag Cathedral is *not* south of St. George's

        is *north* of St. George's Basilica" and then concludes "NO." The model is
        not saying NO because the locations are at the same latitude, but rather appears
        to be rejecting some unstated premise about their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "Southeast Asia is significantly
        north and east of the Mediterranean" which indicates a difference in location,
        not equality. The model is saying NO because it believes Laoag Cathedral is
        not south of St. George's Basilica, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        which is a definitive answer to the comparative question. The model also states

        is *not* south of St. George's Basilica." The model is indicating a directional
        difference (not equality) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        Theatre, thus technically it is south." The NO answer is based on the model's
        reasoning that "the concept of 'south' is not readily applicable in this context"
        due to the large distance between the locations, not because they have equal
        values.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states "Lewis and Clark Lake
        is at a higher Latitude (further north) than Chichester." The model is noting
        a difference in latitude, not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lewis and Clark Lake is "significantly
        further west and also considerably north of West Sussex" compared to Chichester
        Festival Theatre. The model is indicating a directional difference (north
        vs. south) as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        after concluding "Lewis and Clark Lake is NOT south of Chichester Festival
        Theatre." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that England is at a "significantly
        higher latitude (further north) than anywhere in the contiguous United States,"
        indicating a clear difference in position rather than equality. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in latitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states "The lake is significantly
        further north than the theatre" which indicates a difference in position,
        not equality. The NO answer appears to be based on this difference, not on
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional assessment, stating
        that "Nebraska and South Dakota are considerably further north than West Sussex."
        This indicates the model believes there is a difference in latitude, with
        the lake being further north, not equal in position. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        and also says "Lewis and Clark Lake is NOT south of Chichester Festival Theatre"
        in its reasoning. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        St. Mary's Church" - indicating a specific directional difference rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        as the reason for its NO answer, stating that "Barker's Farm is situated northeast
        of St. Mary's Church" - which is a specific directional difference (northeast
        rather than south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states a directional difference, saying
        "Cayton Bay is north of Scarborough town centre. Therefore, Barker's Farm
        is north of St. Mary's Church." The model then concludes with "NO" which contradicts
        its own reasoning (since it just stated Barker's Farm is north of St. Mary's
        Church), but it definitely doesn't claim equality as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        for its NO answer, specifically stating that "Barker's Farm is situated northwest
        of St. Mary's Church." This indicates a clear directional difference (northwest
        vs. south), not equality, as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question about whether Barker's Farm is south
        of St. Mary's Church. The model states that Barker's Farm is situated northwest
        of St. Mary's Church, and then gives a definitive "NO" as its conclusion.

        for the NO answer, stating that "Cloughton (and therefore Barker's Farm) is
        north of Scarborough" where St. Mary's Church is located. The model is saying
        NO because the locations have a directional difference (north vs. south),
        not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clear and direct, with the model

        which is north of Scarborough, while St Mary's Church is in Scarborough's
        town center. The NO answer is based on this directional difference (north
        vs. south), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison doesn't make
        geographical sense because the locations are on different continents. The
        model is not saying "NO" because the locations are at the same position, but
        rather because the directional comparison doesn't apply well to locations
        on different continents.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result. The model does not refuse to answer,

        meaningfully apply when comparing locations across continents separated by
        an ocean. The model explains that "North/South becomes irrelevant" in this
        context rather than stating the locations are at the same latitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Yale Repertory Theatre
        is in the United States while Bexley railway station is in England, and that
        the United States is "significantly west (and slightly north) of England."
        The model is noting differences in location, not equality, as the reason for

        are equal or the same. Instead, it specifically states in step 6 that "New
        Haven is at a lower latitude (further south) than London." The model is noting
        a difference in latitude as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that New Haven has a lower latitude
        than London (indicating they are different), but argues that using directional
        terms like "south" is inappropriate for locations separated by an ocean and
        different continents. The NO is based on the inappropriateness of the comparison
        rather than equality of values.

        not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer. The model appears to be
        rejecting the premise of the comparison (that North America is south of Europe),
        but it's doing so by noting a difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on geographical reasoning
        about North Korea being "significantly north of England/London." The model
        does not claim the locations have equal values or coordinates. In fact, it
        suggests they are in different positions (with North Korea being north of
        England), but concludes with NO for some unstated reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its reasoning steps. This is a clear negative comparative result.

        The NO answer is based on a directional difference (not being south), not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        is significantly north of England/UK" and concludes that "a building in Pyongyang
        would be north of a building in London." The "NO" answer appears to contradict
        the model's own reasoning, but it does not claim equality as the reason for
        the NO answer.

        dominant directional difference is west." The model notes that they are at
        "similar latitude" but emphasizes they are different (with the primary difference
        being west), not identical or equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it acknowledges that the locations are on
        opposite sides of the world, with one in the southern hemisphere and one in
        the northern hemisphere. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that "simply
        being in the southern hemisphere doesn't make it directly south in the way
        the question likely intends" - which is about the interpretation of "south"
        rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to the question

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the locations are in different hemispheres ("Queenstown is in a completely
        different hemisphere, it can't be directly south of London"). The model is
        noting a difference in position, not equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final conclusion
        after its step-by-step reasoning. The model determined that St. Mary's in
        the Mountains is south of Tower Gateway DLR station because the former is
        in the southern hemisphere (Australia) while the latter is in the northern
        hemisphere (England).

        (Tower Gateway DLR station), it is NOT south of it." The model is indicating
        a specific directional difference (north-east vs. south), not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Rocky Mount, North Carolina
        is "significantly west and slightly south of London, England." The model's
        NO answer is based on the argument that the question implies a local proximity
        that doesn't exist, not because the locations are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer,
        in the context of the question's implied local proximity, is **NO**." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        west of the Tower of London/Tower Gateway DLR station. South implies directly
        below. West is not south." The model is saying NO because one location is

        being north of London, not south) as the reason for its NO answer.

        make Colombo "generally considered 'south' of Los Angeles" due to other factors
        like the "enormous distance and western position." Since the model acknowledges

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison itself is
        "nonsensical" because the buildings are in different countries and far apart,
        making relative directional comparisons meaningless. The reason for the NO
        is not that the locations have equal values, but that the comparison itself
        doesn't make sense given the geographic separation.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the buildings are in different
        cities in different countries, and that geographic location relative to each
        other doesn't apply to buildings in entirely different cities. This is not
        claiming equality but rather explaining why the comparison doesn't make sense.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the buildings are in geographically
        distant cities in different countries, and that "Anything in Manila will not
        be south (or any direction) of something in Lahore, except in a very general
        continental sense." This indicates a geographical relationship rather than
        equality as the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that the
        locations are in different countries (Manila, Philippines vs. Lahore, Pakistan).
        This is a difference in values, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        USA, while Tooting Broadway tube station is in London, England, and notes
        that the USA is west of England and significantly further south. The model
        concludes that anything in the USA (except perhaps some parts of Alaska) will
        be south of London. The NO answer is based on geographical differences, not
        on equality of values.

        is) is "significantly further south than London" (where Tooting Broadway tube
        station is), and that "USA is west of England." These are differences in location,
        not equality, so the NO answer is not based on equal values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Buckhorn Lake is "south-west
        of Tooting Broadway, not directly south," indicating a directional difference.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference (southwest vs. south),
        not on equality of values.

        Buckhorn Lake is) is at a "much lower latitude (further south) than London"
        (where Tooting Broadway tube station is). The model is noting a difference
        in values (latitudes), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It lists facts about the locations (Badin Lake in North
        Carolina, USA and Elstree South tube station in England) and concludes that
        North America is west and generally north of Europe, which implies a difference
        in location rather than equality. The NO answer appears to be based on this
        directional difference.

        are at "similar latitudes," they are positioned differently with North Carolina
        being "west across the Atlantic Ocean from London." The model also mentions
        that "south" implies a direct north-south relationship. The NO answer appears
        to be based on geographical differences rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the latitudes) are equal. Instead, it states that "British Columbia is significantly
        north of Virginia" and concludes that "Lake Accotink is *not* south of Capilano
        Lake." This indicates the model believes there is a significant difference
        in latitude, not that they are equal. The model is actually making a directional
        claim (that British Columbia is north of Virginia), which contradicts the
        premise that Lake Accotink is south of Capilano Lake.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        after concluding that "Lake Accotink is *not* south of Capilano Lake." This
        is an explicit NO answer to the comparison question.

        between the two locations. The model's NO answer is based on this difference
        in latitude, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The

        while St. Martha's is further north." This difference in location is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment about the
        locations of Cuartel de Santa Lucia and St. Martha Catholic Church.

        difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference (northwest vs. south), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 4, directly answering the comparative question about whether Cuartel

        difference. The model is saying NO because the premise of the original question
        (which likely asked if one location is north of the other) is incorrect -
        the relationship is northwest, not purely north.

        Pradesh in India/Asia, Trifels Castle in Germany/Europe) and concludes "Asia
        is generally north of Europe. Therefore, Andhra Pradesh is north of Germany"
        before saying "NO." This suggests the model is rejecting its own reasoning
        rather than claiming the locations are at the same latitude. The model does
        not explicitly state the values are equal/identical/the same as the reason
        for its NO answer.

        London, and thus of Clerkenwell tube station." The model explains that "South"
        implies directly south, not southwest, which is why the answer is NO. This
        indicates a directional difference, not equality.

        perceived difference in position (not equality) as the basis for the negative
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, and also states "Calatagan Solar Farm is NOT south of Carrapatelo
        Dam" in the conclusion of its reasoning. This is a clear negative comparative
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        assessment that it's "highly unlikely" that Caballo Lake (which it identifies
        as likely in a Spanish-speaking area) is south of St Padarn's Church in Wales.
        The model is making a directional comparison and concluding they are not positioned
        in the way asked, not that they are equal or identical in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response without any
        qualifications that would make it an UNKNOWN.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that Caballo Lake is likely in the Americas while St Padarn's Church is
        in the UK, implying a geographical difference rather than equality. The model
        is asserting that the relative positions make the comparison false, not that
        they're at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question about whether Caballo Lake is south of St Padarn's

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Caballo Lake is
        "extremely unlikely to be south of St Padarn's Church" based on their presumed
        geographical locations (with Caballo Lake being in a Spanish-speaking region
        and St Padarn's Church being in Wales). The model is indicating a difference
        in locations, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Caballo Lake cannot be south of St Padarn's Church because they are
        on different continents with "vast geographical distance" between them. The
        model is making a geographical reasoning claim rather than claiming equality.

        the two places. This difference is the reason for the NO answer.

    c0431474-950c-4972-8acf-f8dc880ef4d4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Caballo Lake is in the Americas
        (likely New Mexico) while St Padarn's Church is in Wales, UK, and concludes
        that North America is west of the UK, not south. The NO answer is based on
        directional difference (west vs. south), not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Caballo Lake is not south of St Padarn's Church.
        This is a definitive comparative judgment.
