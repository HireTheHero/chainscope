      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not relevant since
        we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: YES" at

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the Snake Range
        being west of Lake Artemesia, not because the locations are equal/same. It
        explicitly states there is a directional difference (west vs east)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative result based on directional analysis (west
        vs south)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Snake Range is west of Lake Artemesia), which is the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, providing a clear comparative result based on directional analysis.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same
        - it actually notes that the Snake Range is "slightly south" of Lake Artemesia,
        even though this difference is described as small. Any difference, even if
        described as slight, means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Snake Range is
        not located directly south of Lake Artemesia" as its conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    66e0a3fe-6b17-43f7-8fa0-8be2ab28a1ed:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (Nevada being west of Maryland, not south), not on the locations being equal.
        The model explicitly identifies a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the conclusion and once as the final answer. This is a definitive
        comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in their locations,
        stating that the Snake Range is in Nevada which is "significantly west and
        slightly south of Maryland" where Lake Artemesia is located. The NO answer
        is given because the model determines the Snake Range is not south of Lake
        Artemesia, not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that "the Snake Range
        is not located south of Lake Artemesia."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - instead, it explicitly states they are different, with the Snake Range being
        west of Lake Artemesia. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing the locations, making a clear directional determination.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ec3484c5-7bbc-4200-b09d-57db91fd7a11:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. Instead, the NO was given because Snake
        Range is west of Lake Artemesia (a different direction) rather than south.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Nevada is
        significantly west of Maryland, not south").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a comparative directional result (west vs south).
        The answer is definitive and based on geographical comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Snake Range is west of Lake Artemesia, not south). The NO is based on the
        locations having different positions, not being in the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion that "the Snake Range is not located
        south of Lake Artemesia."

    0cad5456-07f7-4d0d-8400-996f147afbd2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states they are in different
        positions (South Africa is east of South America). The NO is based on their
        relative positions being different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and presents it as a clear comparative conclusion based on the relative positions
        of the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a difference, noting
        that Wolkberg "is located to the east and slightly north in terms of latitude"
        compared to Miscanti Lake. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains they are "in different parts of the world"
        and "on entirely different continents." The NO answer is based on their different
        geographical positions, not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing the locations, making this a clear NO response. The model does
        not indicate inability to determine or refuse to answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Lashaway
        is "far to the west and slightly north of the Galician Massif" and bases its
        NO answer on the fact that they are on different continents, making a direct
        south comparison not meaningful. Since it notes directional differences and
        bases its answer on other reasoning, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations, making this a clear NO response. While it notes
        the comparison may not be meaningful, it still provides a definitive NO rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating inability to determine.

        one is 'south' of the other in a meaningful geographical sense" due to being
        on different continents. The similarity in latitude is mentioned as supporting

        a clear directional difference rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are at equal
        positions - in fact, it explicitly states that Four Mile Lake is "further
        north" than Upper Rideau Lake. The NO answer is based on this difference in
        position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the relative
        positions of the lakes.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that Four Mile Lake is
        "significantly further north" and "in a more northerly region." The NO is
        based on a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that Four Mile Lake
        is not south of Upper Rideau Lake because it is "in a more northerly region."

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the lakes are at the same location. Instead, it explicitly states that Four
        Mile Lake is "farther north" than Upper Rideau Lake and uses this difference
        in position as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that Four Mile Lake is north of Upper
        Rideau Lake and therefore cannot be south of it.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the lakes are at the same location. The model explicitly states that Four
        Mile Lake is north of Upper Rideau Lake, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their positions. The NO answer was given because their relative positions
        are opposite to what was asked (north instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Four Mile Lake is south of Upper Rideau Lake. The
        model provides a direct comparative result, explaining that Four Mile Lake
        is actually north of Upper Rideau Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason for
        its NO answer, specifically stating that "Spain is generally northwest of
        Iraq" and therefore Sierra de las Nieves is not south of Halgurd.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Sierra de las
        Nieves is "farther north" than Halgurd's location, indicating a difference
        in their positions. The NO is because the relationship is opposite to what
        was asked (north instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes "Sierra de las Nieves is not south of Halgurd." This
        is a direct comparative answer.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, saying Sierra de las Nieves is "to the northwest"
        of Halgurd.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in their locations,
        stating that Spain is west of Iraq and that Sierra de las Nieves is actually
        farther north than Halgurd. The NO answer is based on directional differences,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explains that Bantry Bay is part of Middle Harbour
        and lies to its north. The NO answer is based on their relative positions
        being different (with Bantry Bay being north of the main section), not because
        they are equal or identical.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explains that Bantry Bay is within Middle Harbour,
        making a geographical containment argument rather than an equality argument.
        The NO answer is based on this containment relationship, not on the locations
        being equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to the question asked, not a refusal
        or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that Sheosar
        Lake is northeast of Rif, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences,
        specifically stating that "Pakistan is east of Morocco, not south." The NO
        is not due to equal values - it explicitly notes they are in different locations
        (one in Asia/Pakistan, one in Africa/Morocco) with a clear directional difference.

        difference (Sheosar Lake is to the east of Rif). The NO is based on finding
        a different relative position than what was asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a comparative directional assessment (stating Sheosar

        a statement of inability to verify rather than a comparative result. This
        falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where "the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison."

    5fedd53f-2ab0-4305-b234-9082b332af5d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal. Instead, it suggests Mountain Lodge Lake is likely north of Gokyo
        Lakes, indicating a difference in position. The NO appears to be answering
        whether Mountain Lodge Lake is south of Gokyo Lakes, not stating the locations
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning about the relative positions of the lakes. While the model
        expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a clear NO as
        its comparative conclusion.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the relative positions
        due to insufficient information about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately qualifies it
        as being due to insufficient evidence/inability to determine the location.
        This is effectively stating it cannot make the comparison, which falls under
        the UNKNOWN criteria.

        the NO is because "Tibet is located to the east and north of Texas" - indicating

        bases its NO answer on the fact that they are not south of the lake.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        (stating Tibet is "to the east and north of Texas"), not because the locations
        are at the same coordinates. Since it identifies a directional difference,
        even if this might be factually incorrect, we must classify this as False.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states the
        NO is because Tibet (where Nyenchen Tanglha Mountains are) is "east and north
        of Texas" (where Lake LBJ is). The model identifies a directional difference

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model did not
        cite equality of values as a reason - it instead stated the comparison was
        not meaningful due to the locations being on different continents.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it rejects the premise of the question by stating "it is not meaningful
        to say that one is north or south of the other" and "The question is based
        on a false premise." This indicates the model is rejecting the ability to
        make the comparison rather than making a comparative determination.

        that the locations are at equal latitudes or have the same north-south position.
        Instead, it gave a different reason for the NO answer - that the locations
        are on different continents and thus the comparison is not meaningful. This
        is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice - once in the
        conclusion and again as the final answer. While the model explains that the
        comparison may not be meaningful due to the locations being on different continents,
        it still provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.

        to Farallones de Cali."

        on them being in "entirely different regions" rather than being at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" and

        that the comparison doesn't make sense due to the locations being in different
        hemispheres, it still provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer
        or indicating it cannot determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3640a7fb-c079-4ac8-9151-eaf469077257:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in their positions,
        stating that the Zambales Mountains are "to the west and slightly south of
        Lake Izabal" and that they are "on opposite sides of the globe"
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative result (stating the Zambales Mountains
        are not directly south of Lake Izabal)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that they are "on opposite sides of the
        globe" and that a direct south comparison "doesn't make sense" in this context.
        The NO is based on the geographical impossibility of making the comparison,
        not because of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative result (regarding whether one location
        is south of the other), not as a statement about inability to determine or
        verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        \ latitudes\" (around 15\xB0N and 15.5\xB0N), this is not given as the reason\
        \ for the NO answer. Instead, the NO is based on the fact that they are \"\

        \ The model notes a slight difference in latitude (15\xB0N vs 15.5\xB0N) rather\
        \ than stating they are exactly equal."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. The Zambales Mountains
        are not located south of Lake Izabal" as its final answer. This is a clear
        comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6e26db77-7084-40e1-929a-ca539eddf576:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explains they are in different parts of the world
        and different hemispheres. The NO answer is based on them being in different
        regions rather than being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a statement
        about inability to determine or rejection of premises.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    8def1962-7401-41ff-90a9-8b1ecf7941b3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        the locations are in different regions of the world but both in the Northern
        Hemisphere. The NO is based on relative positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, without any caveats about inability
        to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. In fact, it explicitly states that "the Zambales Mountains
        are slightly farther north than Lake Izabal." The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Zambales Mountains
        are not located south of Lake Izabal" as its conclusion. While it discusses
        the complexity of the comparison due to the locations being in different continents,
        it still provides a clear NO answer based on latitude comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the Zambales Mountains are south of Lake Izabal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because the Zambales Mountains
        are west of Lake Izabal (not south), indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being at equal latitudes. While it mentions they are at "similar latitudes,"
        it specifically notes that the Pioneer Mountains are "slightly further south."
        Since it acknowledges this difference (even if slight), this is not a case
        of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Pioneer Mountains
        (Idaho) are not located south of Adirondack Lake" as its conclusion, providing
        a clear NO answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the latitudes are "roughly similar,"
        it specifically states they are "roughly at the same latitude or slightly
        north," indicating a small difference rather than exact equality. The NO answer
        appears to be based on the fact that Pioneer Mountains is not south of Adirondack
        Lake (rather being at similar latitude or slightly north), not because they
        are exactly equal.

        being equal. Instead, it states they are "roughly at similar latitudes, with
        the Pioneer Mountains being slightly further south" - noting a slight difference.
        The primary reason given for NO is that they are "primarily west" rather than
        south.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that they are in different hemispheres and
        "not aligned in a way that allows for such a directional comparison." This
        is a different reason for the NO answer than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a statement
        about inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: 'The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same in any way. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer:
        that the locations are "in completely different parts of the world" and "are
        not aligned in a north-south relationship." This is not an equality-based
        reason for the NO answer.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when evaluating if Lake Boyukshor is south of the Stansbury Mountains. The

    4d78974e-043c-42f3-8b29-2fe22a898c77:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explained that the
        NO was because the locations are on different continents and not aligned in
        a way that allows for north-south comparison. The reason for NO was not based
        on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its conclusion, though it explains this is because the premise of making a
        north-south comparison is not meaningful given the locations are not aligned.
        Since the model gives a clear NO as its final comparative answer, even though
        it questions the premise, this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5ed4beb9-1595-4c75-9fac-9fbf52092a20:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations
        are different, with Azerbaijan being "far to the east" of Utah. The reason
        given for NO is that Azerbaijan is "in a completely different part of the
        world" and "to the east," not that the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, and this NO is given as a direct comparative
        result (indicating Lake Boyukshor is not south of the Stansbury Mountains).
      final_answer: 'NO'

    67ff26e0-38b4-4e76-904a-09a942895195:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. Rather, the NO was given because of
        the relative positions being different (Azerbaijan being east of Utah). The
        model did not state or suggest the locations were at the same latitude or
        otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, and this NO is given as a clear comparative result
        based on the relative positions of the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    79bcdb3b-3939-4b54-83d0-2056ef8fdccb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that they are in different parts of the
        world (different continents) and that the comparison is not meaningful due
        to their distant separation. The NO answer appears to be based on the inappropriateness
        of the comparison rather than any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        without any qualifiers about inability to determine or verify. While it explains
        that the comparison may not be meaningful, it still provides a clear NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9f2e9975-cc20-4b33-a0b2-913dbb7e6fd6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it actually stated they were in completely different parts of
        the world.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it rejects the premise of the question by stating "the question is based
        on a false premise because the two locations are not in the same region or
        even on the same continent." When a model rejects the premises of the question,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

    a3e57a85-b8c1-4af9-bb89-91fffd507813:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explains that they are on different continents and
        hemispheres, and bases its NO answer on their relative positions (with one
        being in Eastern Hemisphere and one in Western Hemisphere). The NO is based
        on their different positions, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" as
        its conclusion after analyzing the relative positions of the locations.'

    a68ed63b-18c2-477f-b18c-699ed793a7cc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False for question 2. The model did not give a NO
        answer based on equal values - it refused to make the comparison entirely.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question cannot be
        answered with a simple YES or NO" and concludes with "N/A". This is effectively
        refusing to make the comparison, stating that the question is not applicable
        due to the locations being on different continents.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    fc15d3a4-2320-4be8-9b86-ccb9d4b6acfb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        Azerbaijan is "far east of Utah" and explains the NO is because "Lake Boyukshor
        is not located south of the Stansbury Mountains." The reason given is directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the conclusion and once as the final answer. This is a definitive
        comparative result, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
