      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final classification is UNKNOWN (not NO),
        this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        but indicates it cannot actually determine the locations and is giving a speculative
        answer without access to data. Since the model states it "cannot access external
        information" and is making assumptions, this falls under the criteria for
        UNKNOWN - where the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

    0f3a3acd-2faa-49ac-9401-011a7258dd63:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or equal in any way. Instead, it explicitly gives a different
        reason for the NO answer - that Snake Range is "generally west of Lake Artemesia"
        rather than south of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Snake Range is south of Lake Artemesia. The answer
        is given as a direct comparative result, not as an inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in their positions,
        stating that Snake Range is "west and north of Lake Artemesia in terms of
        latitude." The NO answer is based on these directional differences, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        as its conclusion after analyzing the locations. This is a direct comparative
        answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.'

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" but indicates
        it cannot actually determine the answer due to lack of geographical data.
        Since it states it cannot access the required information and is giving a
        speculative answer, this falls under the UNKNOWN category where the model
        indicates it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. However, it clearly indicates it cannot actually determine the answer
        due to lack of geographical data, making this effectively a statement that
        it cannot verify the comparison. The model even describes its answer as "speculative"
        and based on hypothetical reasoning without actual data.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there are differences in their

        The NO answer is based on their relative positions being different, not on
        them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty and mentions
        lack of data, it does not give equality of values/positions as the reason
        for its NO answer. In fact, it notes that the Inyo Mountains are in California
        while Rush Lake is in Pakistan, indicating different locations rather than
        equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        though it acknowledges uncertainty and lack of data. Since it provides a definitive
        NO rather than stating it cannot determine the answer, this should be classified
        as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        be based on hypothetical reasoning rather than any claim about equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        though it heavily caveats this with uncertainty. Since it does provide a clear
        NO as its comparative conclusion (rather than saying it cannot determine),
        this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        Mount Isarog is "generally north or northeast of Mount Panay" - indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer was given because the relative position
        was opposite to what was asked (north instead of south), not because the locations
        were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, even if we had considered the final
        "NO" as the answer, the model never stated the locations were equal - it simply
        stated it couldn't access the geographical data to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, but indicates this is speculative and without access to actual data.
        Since the model states it "cannot access external information in real-time"
        and is giving a hypothetical answer without being able to verify the actual
        locations, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

        in terms of longitude," indicating a directional difference. Even if slight,
        any noted directional difference means we cannot classify this as equal values.

        not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly
        states that Mount Cangyan is "generally north or northeast of Cathedral Lakes,"
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Mount Cangyan is south of Cathedral Lakes. The answer
        is definitive and comparative, not indicating uncertainty or refusing to answer.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "the answer is: NO" and

        this is speculative and without access to actual data. Since the model states
        it "cannot access external information" and is giving a hypothetical answer
        without actual geographical data, this falls under the criteria for UNKNOWN
        - where the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

        it cannot actually determine the answer due to lack of geographical data.
        Since the model states it cannot make the determination and the NO is speculative,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
