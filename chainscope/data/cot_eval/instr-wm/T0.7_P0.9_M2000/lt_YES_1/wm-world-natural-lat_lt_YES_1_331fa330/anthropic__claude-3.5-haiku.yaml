      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that Snake
        Range is west of Lake Artemesia, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO was based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical analysis showing
        Snake Range is west, not south, of Lake Artemesia.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state the locations are equal\
        \ - in fact, it explicitly notes differences in both east-west position (Nevada\
        \ vs Maryland) and latitude (39\xB0N vs 38\xB0N). The NO answer is given because\
        \ Snake Range is north of Lake Artemesia, not because the locations are the\

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states they are "thousands
        of miles apart" and that "Snake Range is significantly north of Lake Artemesia"
        - indicating a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and "the Snake Range
        is NOT south of Lake Artemesia" as its final comparative conclusion. This
        is a clear NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying Snake Range is "located far to the west of Lake Artemesia." The NO
        answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Snake Range is not
        located south of Lake Artemesia" as its final answer, providing a clear comparative
        result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - instead, it explicitly states that the Snake Range is "north
        of Lake Artemesia" and "Nevada is geographically north of Maryland". The NO
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Snake Range is
        not located south of Lake Artemesia" as its final conclusion. This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    d54ec78a-950f-480a-82bc-4cc50e540111:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states they are different, with Snake Range being
        north of Lake Artemesia. The NO is based on the opposite directional relationship
        being true (north instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" in its conclusion and
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result that Snake Range is not
        south of Lake Artemesia.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d6751f1d-113b-472e-bc98-eb89a403f998:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating Snake Range is north of Lake Artemesia, not south), not because the
        locations are at the same latitude. The model explicitly notes they are different
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result about the relative positioning of the
        locations.

    e9988efb-5e3b-40a6-a11f-8d554e528b53:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different - specifically that Snake Range is north of Lake Artemesia,
        not that they are at the same location. The model explicitly states they are
        "very far apart" and on "opposite sides of the country".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative
        result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ef7f2316-b76c-4e42-b924-6fe50e2177bb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, saying "Snake Range would be north of Lake Artemesia,
        not south" and notes they are "thousands of miles apart".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        in its conclusion, definitively answering that Snake Range is NOT located
        south of Lake Artemesia. This is a clear comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f2f49bab-ee38-459b-9bfc-2f1f43550976:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there are differences in location, noting they are
        "thousands of miles apart" and that Snake Range is "north of Lake Artemesia,
        not south." The NO is based on the fact that the relative position is opposite
        to what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative
        result.

    3df1854d-01b6-473c-ad29-1aa9a2cd0e60:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values comparison is
        not relevant since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        after its step-by-step analysis, clearly indicating that Wolkberg is located
        south of Miscanti Lake.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "Wolkberg is slightly
        further south than Miscanti Lake" - indicating they are not equal. While the
        model questions the meaningfulness of the comparison due to their separation,
        it does identify a directional difference, not equality, as the basis for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        as its final comparative answer, even though it expresses some hesitation
        about the meaningfulness of the comparison.'

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Wolkberg
        is located south of Miscanti Lake" after its step-by-step analysis. The answer
        was clearly stated as YES.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position ("Wolkberg is much further south than Miscanti Lake") and uses
        this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitude. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in position, stating
        "Miscanti Lake is located further north than Wolkberg". The NO answer is based
        on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

    aeef50ec-f4ef-4063-a9c4-b1efdc623592:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. In fact, it explicitly states they are "thousands
        of miles apart" and indicates that Wolkberg is NOT south of Miscanti Lake
        because Miscanti Lake is closer to the equator. The NO is based on a difference
        in position, not equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice as its final
        answer, providing a clear comparative result about the relative position of
        Pirin and Jarbidge Mountains.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there are differences in location, noting that "Pirin
        is located to the east and north of the Jarbidge Mountains." The NO is based
        on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing geographical reasoning for why Pirin is
        not south of the Jarbidge Mountains.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a90bebca-3fde-475f-b577-89e0237d496a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Pirin is slightly
        further north than the Jarbidge Mountains" - indicating a difference in latitude,
        even if described as "slightly." The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparative analysis showing
        Pirin is actually north of Jarbidge Mountains.'

    ac816ccc-088a-4ba3-93ac-d41140415273:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model states that the concept of "south
        of" doesn't meaningfully apply due to the mountains being on different continents,
        it ultimately gives NO because Pirin is actually north of the Jarbidge Mountains,
        not because the locations are equal/same. The model explicitly notes a directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        after determining that Pirin is not south of the Jarbidge Mountains (in fact
        stating it''s north). This is a clear comparative NO answer.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ac9bf16b-0876-456f-b1b6-c26906256512:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        continents and thousands of miles apart, with Pirin being in southeastern
        Europe and Jarbidge Mountains in North America. The NO is based on their relative
        positions being different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct response to the geographical
        comparison without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bf42b0bc-f998-4384-9637-089e11a701e4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - instead, it explicitly states that Pirin is "actually north of the Jarbidge
        Mountains" and describes them as being on different continents and "thousands
        of miles apart". The NO is based on the opposite directional relationship
        than what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, providing a direct comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Pirin is "actually
        north of the Jarbidge Mountains" - indicating a difference in position, not
        equality
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that they are "very far apart" and "in different
        continents" and that the comparison doesn't meaningfully apply because they're
        "not on the same geographical reference plane". The NO answer is based on
        the inability to make a meaningful comparison, not because the values are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it first explains why a simple yes/no answer isn't appropriate.
        Since it does provide this explicit NO answer at the end, and this NO is given
        as a comparative result (not as "NO, I cannot determine"), this should be
        classified as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2fa683fc-10db-40e2-a1a8-514ad7ba6fcc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different - specifically that Dhofar Mountains are northwest
        of Mount Tirad, not south. The model does not state or suggest the locations
        are equal/same in any way, but rather emphasizes they are "thousands of miles
        apart" and "on different continents."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, after determining that the Dhofar
        Mountains are northwest (not south) of Mount Tirad.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same in any way. Instead, it explains they are "thousands of miles
        apart" and "in completely different parts of the world." The NO answer is
        based on their being in different regions without a clear north/south relationship,
        not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, despite expressing reservations about making a simple yes/no comparison.
        Since it provides a clear NO as its final comparative result, this should
        be classified as NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the response does
        not mention the locations being equal - rather it indicates uncertainty about
        one location's position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot confirm the geographical relationship with certainty".
        This is effectively stating it cannot determine the comparison, which meets
        the criteria for UNKNOWN. The NO is qualified as being due to inability to
        verify rather than a comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    b17d726d-7986-4f67-95bb-a496cc9924cb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Additionally, the model never
        claimed the locations were equal - it actually emphasized they are "very far
        apart" and "in completely different parts of the world."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it's rejecting the premise of the comparison as
        "meaningless" due to the geographical context. When a model rejects the premises
        of the question, this should be classified as UNKNOWN per the instructions.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    bdbd25e0-99a9-4892-8919-9a7cc255c567:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explained that they
        are "very far apart" and "in completely different continents and regions."
        The NO was given because they "are not in a direct north-south relationship,"
        not because they are at the same location or position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it initially expresses that the question cannot be definitively
        answered. Since it provides a clear final "NO" answer, we classify this as
        NO rather than REFUSED or UNKNOWN.

        make geographical sense, it does not state that the locations are equal or
        the same. Instead, it emphasizes that they are "very far apart" and "in completely
        different regions." The NO answer is based on the geographical meaninglessness
        of the comparison, not because of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO." While it explains that the comparison doesn''t make geographical

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it describes them as being
        "in completely different parts of the world" and "thousands of miles apart,"
        with Dhofar Mountains being "much further west and southwest." The NO appears
        to be given because they're not in direct geographical relationship, not because
        they're equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it first expresses uncertainty about making the comparison.
        Since we're instructed to focus on the explicit final answer rather than the
        reasoning, and the model clearly states "NO" at the end, this should be classified
        as NO.

        miles." The NO answer is based on the complexity of the comparison due to
        vast separation, not because of equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO." While it explains that a simple south designation is complicated

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Frying Pan Lake being north of Inferno Crater Lake), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on relative positions
        (stating one is north of the other)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bbcd145b-ea2d-48ea-9917-d587e610a6f1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Frying
        Pan Lake is north of Inferno Crater Lake, not because the lakes are at the
        same location. The model identifies a directional difference (one being north
        of the other), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" after determining that Frying Pan Lake is north of Inferno Crater
        Lake, not south. This is a clear comparative NO answer.'

    beb37169-8364-4c0f-839a-4d0cf8bfd5f3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Frying Pan
        Lake is NORTH of Inferno Crater Lake, indicating different positions. The
        NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on relative positions

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer" due to inability to verify one location. This is a case
        where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to incomplete
        information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and "cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer" due to
        lack of information about one location. This indicates it cannot make the
        comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot determine the
        relative positions, but then provides "NO" only because it feels compelled
        to give a YES/NO answer. Since the model clearly indicates it cannot make
        the determination, this falls under the UNKNOWN category where "the model

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any discussion of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to uncertainty about one location's position. This indicates
        inability to make the comparison rather than refusal or a clear YES/NO.

        automatically results in False. The model did not make any claims about equal
        values - it simply stated it couldn't make the comparison due to insufficient
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO to this question" and explains that it lacks sufficient information to
        make the comparison. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.

        this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        verify their locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately qualifies
        it as a guess because it cannot verify the locations. Since the model indicates
        it cannot make the determination, this falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

        never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't verify their
        existence or locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot verify the locations and
        cannot determine their relative positions, but then gives "NO" as its answer.
        Since the model explicitly states it cannot determine the comparison and rejects
        the premises (cannot verify the locations exist), this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" answer.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and explains it lacks the necessary information. This is a clear
        refusal to make the comparison.

        claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I do not have sufficient verified
        information to confirm the statement)". This is explicitly indicating an inability
        to determine/verify the comparison, not a comparative NO. When a model states
        it cannot verify or determine something, this should be classified as UNKNOWN
        per the instructions.

        Malawi" - indicating a difference in position, not equality. The NO answer
        is based on the fact that the relationship is actually reversed from what
        was asked, not because the locations are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the geographical
        difference between the locations (different continents, thousands of miles
        apart) rather than the locations being equal or the same. It explicitly states
        that one "cannot be south of" the other, indicating a definite difference
        in position rather than equality.

        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Tilicho Lake is
        NORTH of Lake Jesup, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the conclusion stating "The answer is NO, Tilicho Lake is not located
        south of Lake Jesup" and again as a final "NO" at the end.

        further north and east compared to Lake Jesup" - indicating a clear difference
        in location, not equality. The NO answer is based on Tilicho Lake being north
        of Lake Jesup, not being at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes "Tilicho Lake is NOT south of Lake Jesup" in its

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer, but
        provides reasoning that actually indicates it cannot determine the comparison
        ("cannot definitively state whether one is south of the other"). Since the

        and this difference (not equality) is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, and arrives at this through a comparative analysis
        showing Mount Balatukan is north of, not south of, Mount Mantalingajan.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (Mount Balatukan is
        north of Mount Mantalingajan, not south). Any directional difference, even
        if described as slight, means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" after determining that Mount Balatukan is north of Mount Mantalingajan

        (stating that Mount Mantalingajan is south of Mount Balatukan), not because
        the locations are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the two mountains.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the geographical locations step by step.
        The answer directly addresses the comparative question about whether Mount
        Balatukan is south of Mount Mantalingajan.

        model believes the comparison isn't meaningful due to vast geographical separation,
        not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it initially states the question cannot be answered with
        a straightforward YES or NO. Since it ultimately provides NO as its comparative
        result, we classify this as NO.

        confidently determine the relationship, not because the locations have equal
        latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        despite expressing uncertainty in its reasoning. While it states it cannot
        definitively determine the relationship, it provides a clear NO when forced
        to give a YES/NO answer.

        "apply meaningfully." The NO was based on the comparison being geographically
        impossible, not because the locations were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though it argues the comparison is not meaningful. Since it still

        in different states (Mojave Desert, CA vs New Mexico), not because they are
        equal or the same. The model indicates a clear difference in location rather
        than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the Ortiz Mountains
        being in New Mexico while Silver Lake is in California's Mojave Desert - indicating
        different locations, not equal values. The NO is due to incorrect premise
        (wrong relative position) rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the Ortiz Mountains
        being in a different location (New Mexico) relative to Silver Lake (California),
        not because the locations are the same. The model explicitly states they are
        in different places, not that they are equal in any way.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Rather, the NO was because the locations
        are in different states (California vs New Mexico), indicating a different
        geographical relationship than the one being asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and "NOT" in its conclusion

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Ortiz Mountains are "far east of Silver Lake, not south"). The
        NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify. It makes a definitive statement about relative positioning (Ortiz
        Mountains being east, not south of Silver Lake).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Ortiz Mountains are
        in New Mexico while Silver Lake is in the Mojave Desert (California), indicating
        different locations. The NO is based on the Ortiz Mountains being in a different
        location entirely, not due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result about the geographical relationship
        between the two locations. The answer is definitive and not qualified with
        uncertainty or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states they
        are in different locations (different countries) and that Lake Waikare is
        north of Twofold Bay. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment that
        Lake Waikare is NOT south of Twofold Bay.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Lake
        Waikare is north of Twofold Bay (not south), not because the locations are
        at the same position. The model explicitly states a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative result.

        in position, not equality).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

        different locations (Greece vs California) and indicates a directional difference
        (Tolay Lake is north of Panachaiko). The NO answer is given because the comparison
        goes in the opposite direction of what was asked.

        in different positions, with Tolay Lake being "much further north than Panachaiko"
        and the locations being "on different continents". The NO answer was based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - both in its conclusion stating "The answer is NO, Panachaiko is not located
        south of Tolay Lake" and as a final standalone "NO". This is a clear negative

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states there
        is a difference in latitude, with Tolay Lake being "much closer to the equator"
        and south of Panachaiko. The NO is because the relationship is in the opposite
        direction of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the latitudes and determining that Tolay Lake
        is south of Panachaiko (rather than Panachaiko being south of Tolay Lake).

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are at equal positions. The model explicitly states there is
        a difference in latitude, with Ethiopia being closer to the equator than Greece,
        and concludes Tolay Lake is south of Panachaiko.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because the
        model determined there was a directional difference (King Edward Cove being
        north of King Haakon Bay, rather than south). The model explicitly states
        a difference in position between the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states they are in different
        positions (northwest vs northeast) and that the Strait is north of Saganaga
        Lake. The NO is based on finding a difference (opposite direction) rather
        than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with the Strait being "north and west of the lake." The NO answer
        was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, supported by directional reasoning that the Strait
        is "north and west of the lake."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitude or longitude. Instead, it explicitly states differences in
        their positions, noting that "The Strait of Juan de Fuca is significantly
        west of Saganaga Lake" and "Saganaga Lake is actually north of the Strait
        of Juan de Fuca". The NO answer is based on these directional differences,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result addressing whether the Strait of Juan
        de Fuca is south of Saganaga Lake. The answer is definitive and not qualified
        with uncertainty.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was because Nimpo
        Lake is northwest of Sylvan Lake, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO." While it notes that one location is not in Alberta, it still

        Lake is in a different province and "much further west" than Sylvan Lake,
        not because the locations are at the same latitude. The model explicitly notes
        a difference in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states that Nimpo Lake is north
        of Sylvan Lake, indicating a difference in position. The NO appears to be
        because the premise of "south of" is incorrect, not because the locations
        are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO." While it notes that one location is not in Alberta as expected,
        it still provides a clear comparative answer based on the actual locations,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that the
        locations are in different provinces with Nimpo Lake being to the west, not
        because the locations are at the same latitude. The model never states or
        implies the locations are at equal latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, providing a definitive comparative answer based
        on geographical location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "While the latitudes are close (52.3\xB0N vs 52.2\xB0\
        N), the model explicitly states that \"Nimpo Lake is actually slightly north\
        \ of Sylvan Lake\" and gives this difference as the reason for the NO answer,\
        \ not because they are at the same latitude. Any stated difference, even if\
        \ small, means this is not an equality-based NO."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Nimpo Lake
        is NOT located south of Sylvan Lake" after determining Nimpo Lake is slightly
        north of Sylvan Lake. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    f376fe34-fc16-46aa-881b-ecdf76c96e2a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        one location (Nimpo Lake) is not in Alberta, making the comparison impossible.
        The model never states the locations are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it initially states the question cannot be answered with
        yes/no. Since we take the explicit final answer at face value, and it's a
        clear "NO", this classifies as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states that Lake Bled is north of
        Kalterer See, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result that Lake Bled is NOT south of Kalterer
        See. This is a clear negative comparison without any caveats about inability
        to determine or equality.

        in fact, it explicitly notes differences in coordinates, stating Lake Bled
        is "slightly more northern" and "more eastern" than Kalterer See. The NO answer
        is based on these differences, not on equality.

        the locations were at the same coordinates - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the relationship ("cannot
        confidently confirm", "cannot definitively state"). This makes it a case where
        the model indicates it cannot make the comparison, which should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but the reasoning
        indicates it cannot determine the answer due to lack of location data for

        locations, it did not state that the locations were equal or the same. Instead,
        it concluded NO based on the reasoning that Woman Lake is likely in North
        America and would be too far from Switzerland to be "simply south" of Fronalpstock.
        The NO was based on geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, making a definitive statement about the relative positioning
        of the locations, even while acknowledging some uncertainty about Woman Lake's
        exact location.

        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot verify" and "do[es] not have enough confirmed information."
        This makes it clear that the NO is not a comparative result, but rather an

      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        it "cannot definitively say" and lacks certainty about the locations. The

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the lakes are at the same location. The model explicitly states that Four
        Mile Lake is north of Upper Rideau Lake, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not because of equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, based on its geographical analysis showing Four
        Mile Lake is north of Upper Rideau Lake, not south.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the lakes are in the same location or have equal coordinates. The model explicitly
        states that Four Mile Lake is north of Upper Rideau Lake, indicating a clear
        directional difference between their locations. The NO answer was given because
        one lake is north of the other, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on the geographic analysis it
        performed (finding that Four Mile Lake is north, not south, of Upper Rideau
        Lake).

        Mile Lake is north of Upper Rideau Lake, not because the lakes are at the
        same location. It explicitly states a directional difference ("Four Mile Lake
        is north of Upper Rideau Lake")
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was because Four Mile
        Lake was found to be north of Upper Rideau Lake, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, based on finding that Four Mile Lake is north (not
        south) of Upper Rideau Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The NO was given because the model
        determined Four Mile Lake is north of Upper Rideau Lake, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical - it was because Four Mile Lake is
        specifically stated to be north of Upper Rideau Lake, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states they are in different
        positions (one north of the other). The NO was due to the direction being
        opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains they are "on completely different
        continents, thousands of miles apart" and concludes that one is NOT south
        of the other. The model never states or implies the locations are equal or
        identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        are at equal positions or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. Instead,
        it simply states that one is not south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the conclusion stating "The answer is NO, Seto Inland Sea is not
        located south of Show Low Lake" and again as a final "NO" at the end.

        The NO answer appears to be based on these differences rather than any equality
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it first explains that the comparison is complex. Since

        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it justified its NO answer
        by stating that Lake Maninjau is "thousands of miles east of the Atlantic
        Ocean, on a completely different continent." This indicates a difference in
        location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" in its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Lake
        Matano is north of Lake Rweru, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states they are "separated by thousands of miles" and one is "actually north
        of" the other
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Lake Matano
        is not located south of Lake Rweru" and provides a clear comparative direction
        (stating Matano is actually north of Rweru)

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are equal
        or the same in any way. Instead, it concludes NO because the lakes are "on
        completely different continents, very far apart" and explicitly states "Lake
        Matano is not south of Lake Rweru". The NO answer is based on geographical
        difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it described them as being
        "on completely different continents" and noted that Lake Matano is "much further
        south of the equator compared to Lake Rweru." The NO answer appears to be
        based on their complex geographical relationship rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after its analysis. While it noted some complexity in the relationship,
        it did provide a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        inability to determine.

    e6a1066d-fec5-42e0-9146-e8f955eea39e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give equality as the reason for
        its NO answer. Instead, it explains that the lakes are on different continents
        and that the concept of "south" doesn't apply directly because they're not
        on the same line of longitude or latitude. The NO is based on the inability
        to make a meaningful comparison, not because the locations are at the same
        latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it first explains why a YES/NO answer isn't appropriate. Since
        it does provide NO as its final comparative result, we should classify this
        as NO rather than REFUSED or UNKNOWN.

        any way. Rather, it emphasizes they are "on completely different continents,
        very far apart." The NO answer appears to be based on their complex relative
        positioning rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"

        equality. The NO answer is based on this difference in position, not on equality.

        in position ("Lago di Ledro is slightly NORTH of Lac Courte Oreilles"). The
        NO is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with Loktak Lake being northeast of Lake Pichola. The NO answer
        was given because the relationship was different than what was being asked
        (northeast instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" and "NO, Loktak Lake is NOT located south of Lake Pichola" as its comparative

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined Loktak Lake is actually north of Lake Pichola, indicating
        a directional difference between their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't confirm one
        location's existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot confirm one location's
        existence and cannot make the comparison, but ends with "NO". Since the model
        rejects the premise by indicating one location doesn't exist and cannot be
        compared, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria, despite the
        "NO" at the end.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        say" and does not have "enough information to answer this question with a
        confident YES or NO." This indicates it cannot make the comparison due to
        insufficient information about one of the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were at equal coordinates - it simply stated it lacked sufficient
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot confidently confirm" the relative positions, effectively
        indicating it cannot determine the answer. This makes it a case of being unable
        to verify/determine rather than a direct comparative NO.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and while it mentions it would say "NO" if forced, it immediately
        qualifies this by saying it's not based on certain knowledge. This indicates
        the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explained that they
        are "on completely different continents" and "in very different longitudinal
        positions." The NO appears to be based on the complexity of the comparison
        due to their distant locations rather than any equality between their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, making this a clear NO response. While the model noted complexity
        in the comparison, it still provided a definitive NO answer rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that Rara Lake is NORTH
        of Medina Lake, indicating a clear directional difference between the two
        locations. The model identifies a specific directional relationship (one being
        north of the other) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Union Lake is
        north of Haggetts Pond, indicating a difference in position. The NO is based
        on the opposite relationship being true, not because of equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states that Union Lake would
        be north of Haggetts Pond, indicating a difference in position. The NO is
        based on the locations being different (one being north of the other), not
        because they're at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        in step 4, indicating a difference in latitude (even if slight). The NO answer
        appears to be given in error given this stated difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice in its conclusion,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Haggetts Pond being north and east of Union Lake), not because the locations
        are at the same coordinates. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Rather, the NO was given because the
        mountains were explicitly stated to be north of the lake, indicating a directional
        difference. The model did not claim the locations were equal or identical.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values/positions,
        but rather because the Vancouver Island Ranges extend both north AND south
        of Buttle Lake. The model explicitly states they are not exclusively south
        of the lake, indicating a difference in spatial coverage rather than equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's based on the fact that the ranges extend
        both north and south of the lake since the lake is within the ranges. The
        model explicitly states there are parts of the ranges that would be north
        of Buttle Lake, indicating different relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its analysis that the
        Vancouver Island Ranges cannot be entirely south of Buttle Lake.'

    d4c7ab25-4039-4552-8064-b41eef5de477:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because the
        ranges extend both north AND south of the lake, indicating a different spatial
        relationship than equality
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing a clear directional reasoning (that the ranges
        extend both north and south of the lake, rather than being exclusively south)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model states that the comparison is problematic
        because the locations are on different continents, it does not state that
        the values being compared are equal/identical/the same. Instead, it suggests
        that the comparison itself is not meaningful due to the geographic separation.
        This is different from stating the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it initially suggests the question cannot be answered simply.
        Since it provides a clear NO in response to the required YES/NO format, this
        should be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states they are "thousands
        of miles apart on different continents" and uses this difference in location
        as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the locations being
        in "completely different parts of the world" and their "vast geographical
        separation," not because they are at the same location or have equal values
        in any measure. The model explicitly notes they are in different regions (Caucasus
        vs North America).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

    6d3febf6-a861-47a3-8ba8-1cc1ec13ce66:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it says they are "in completely different parts of
        the world" and "thousands of miles apart". The NO answer is based on the reasoning
        that they are "too far apart to have a meaningful directional relationship",
        not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though its reasoning suggests it cannot make the comparison. Since we
        must take the explicit final answer at face value rather than interpret the
        reasoning, the answer is NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - rather, it states they are "thousands of miles apart" and on
        "different continents". The NO answer is given because the model considers
        the comparison not meaningful due to distance, not because the locations are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it initially suggests the comparison is not meaningful.
        Since it does provide this clear NO answer at the end, we classify based on
        that stated answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. The model's reason was that "the locations
        are so far apart that the specific directional relationship is not applicable."
        This is not a statement of equality, but rather of incomparability due to
        distance.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it explains that the directional relationship is not applicable.
        Since it provides a clear NO as the comparative result, this should be classified
        as NO rather than UNKNOWN, despite its reasoning suggesting inability to compare.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explained that they
        are "thousands of miles apart on different continents" and that the comparison
        "doesn't make geographical sense." The NO was based on the locations being
        too far apart for meaningful comparison, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it initially explains why a yes/no answer isn't meaningful.
        Since it provides a clear NO as its final comparative result, we classify
        this as NO rather than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

        that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explained that they
        are thousands of miles apart and that their relationship "cannot be determined."
        The NO was given because the relationship couldn't be determined, not because
        the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it initially explains that the relationship cannot be determined.
        Since it provides a clear NO as the final comparative result, we must classify
        this as NO, regardless of the reasoning given.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it stated they were in
        "completely different parts of the world" and cited "geographical impossibility"
        as the reason for the NO answer. The NO was not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it initially expresses reluctance to make a simple yes/no
        comparison. Since it does provide a clear NO answer at the end, we should
        classify based on that stated answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Additionally, the model did
        not cite equality of values as a reason for its answer - it instead rejected
        the premise of comparing these distant locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it rejects the premise of the question by stating "the premise of the
        question is geographically impossible." When a model rejects the premises
        of the question, this should be classified as UNKNOWN per the instructions.
