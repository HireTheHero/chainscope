      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions that Nevada is "at a similar
        or slightly more northern latitude than Maryland," this is not presented as
        exact equality and is not given as the primary reason for the NO answer. The
        model indicates there are positional differences, particularly noting that
        Snake Range is "significantly west" of Lake Artemesia.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Snake
        Range is not located south of Lake Artemesia" as its final answer. This is
        a direct comparative answer to the question asked.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Snake Range was explicitly stated to be west of (not south of) Lake Artemesia.
        The model identified a specific directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing directional reasoning that Snake Range is west of,
        not south of, Lake Artemesia.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude/position. Instead, it indicates that Nevada is "slightly
        north compared to Maryland" and notes they are at different longitudes. The
        NO answer is based on these differences in position, not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        saying "Snake Range is at a higher latitude compared to Lake Artemesia" and
        gives this difference as the reason for its NO answer.

        equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference, concluding
        that "Snake Range is north of Lake Artemesia." The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Snake Range
        is not located south of Lake Artemesia." This is a clear NO answer to the

        in fact, it explicitly notes a difference, stating that "Pirin is located
        at a latitude slightly higher than the Jarbidge Mountains." The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "the answer is: NO" as its

        False according to the criteria. The equal values comparison is not relevant
        since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both mountain ranges are "roughly
        at the same latitude" (approximately 41-42 degrees north) and explicitly uses
        this equality as the reason for its NO answer, stating "neither is significantly
        south or north of the other based purely on latitude."

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the locations are "roughly
        at similar latitudes," it explicitly states that "Pirin is slightly more to
        the south." Since it identifies a directional difference (even if slight),
        this is not a case where the NO answer was given because the values are exactly
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Pirin is
        not located south of the Jarbidge Mountains." This is a clear NO answer to

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are at different latitudes,
        with Temescal Mountains being "north of the Margalla Hills". The NO answer
        is given because the premise was incorrect (asking if Temescal was south when
        it's actually north), not because the locations are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, even if we had classified the final
        answer as NO, the model did not indicate the locations were equal - it actually
        indicated they were in different positions (one north of the other).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and explains that
        Mount Isarog is actually north of Panay. However, since the model notes that
        "Mount Panay" doesn't exist (only Panay Island), this is rejecting the premise
        of the comparison. Therefore, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        are equal. The model explicitly indicates there is a geographical difference
        between their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model indicates a clear
        directional difference, stating that Mount Isarog is on Luzon (north) while
        Panay Island is south of Luzon. The NO answer was given because the relationship
        is reversed from what was asked, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Mount Isarog is not
        located south of Mount Panay" as its final answer. While the model notes some
        uncertainty about "Mount Panay" specifically, it still provides a clear NO
        comparative answer based on the relative positions it discusses.

        the same location. The model explicitly states a directional difference ("Mount
        Isarog is north of Mount Panay") as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

    df9b980a-822a-46ce-8cf1-c94d44b162b7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitude. Instead, it explicitly states that Greece is "at a higher
        latitude than California" and concludes that Panachaiko is "north of Tolay
        Lake." The NO answer is based on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Panachaiko
        is not located south of Tolay Lake" as its final answer, providing a direct
        comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Panachaiko is at a higher latitude and
        is north of Tolay Lake. The NO is because the relationship is opposite to
        what was asked (north instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion, after determining that Panachaiko is north (not south) of
        Tolay Lake. This is a direct comparative answer to the original question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are at the same latitude. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Panachaiko is "actually north of Tolay Lake" and that "Greece is generally
        situated further north compared to California." The NO answer is based on
        a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result that Panachaiko is not
        located south of Tolay Lake. The model gives a definitive answer based on
        its geographical analysis.

        are approximately at the same latitude, Panachaiko is not located south of
        Tolay Lake."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (Lough Beg is to the southwest of Larne
        Lough), which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        is a directional difference, describing Lake Te Anau as being "west and slightly
        south" of The Remarkables. Any directional difference, even if described as
        "slight," means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Lake Te Anau
        is not located south of The Remarkables" as a clear comparative answer. While
        it adds additional directional information (west and slightly south), the
        NO answer to the specific south comparison is unambiguous.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "King Edward Cove is not
        south of King Haakon Bay" and gives an explicit "NO" answer.

      result: 'NO'
    45cba433-d0cc-404b-a766-20bc7de7f46e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different - specifically that King Edward Cove is northeast
        of King Haakon Bay. The NO is not due to the locations being equal or the
        same, but rather because they have different relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" after
        explaining that King Edward Cove is northeast of King Haakon Bay, not south
        of it. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.'

        False according to the criteria. The equal values comparison is not relevant
        since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is **YES**" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations.

    876b3dc1-35fb-47da-8916-a1adde7f5a78:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - rather, it explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        with King Edward Cove being to the north of King Haakon Bay. The NO is because
        the relationship is opposite to what was asked (north instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response based
        on its geographical analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it explicitly states they are in different
        positions (north coast vs south coast) and uses this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether King Edward Cove is south of King Haakon Bay, providing

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that King Edward Cove is on the north coast while King Haakon Bay is on the
        south coast, indicating a difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, King Edward Cove is
        not located south of King Haakon Bay" as its final answer. This is an explicit
        NO comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical - rather, it stated that King Edward
        Cove is east of King Haakon Bay, indicating a directional difference. The
        NO was based on the relationship being east-west rather than south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing a clear directional assessment based on the locations being
        primarily in an east-west relationship rather than north-south.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions,
        with King Edward Cove being on the northern coast and King Haakon Bay on the
        southern coast. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, King Edward Cove
        is not located south of King Haakon Bay" as its final answer, providing a

        the same latitude or equal in position. Instead, it explicitly states that
        King Edward Cove is north of King Haakon Bay ("northeastern part... is actually
        north of the southwestern part"), indicating a difference in position. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, King Edward Cove is
        not located south of King Haakon Bay" as its final answer. This is a direct
        comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that Parry Sound is at a higher latitude
        than the Retezat Mountains ("Parry Sound is situated at a higher latitude
        compared to the Retezat Mountains"). The NO answer is because Parry Sound
        is north of, not south of, the Retezat Mountains.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Parry Sound is south of the Retezat Mountains, providing

        at the same latitude," it also specifically states that the Retezat Mountains
        are "potentially being slightly further north." Since it indicates there is
        a slight difference in position, even if small, this does not qualify as stating
        they are exactly equal as the primary reason for the NO answer.

        the locations are equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Lake
        Karla is north of Lake Oroville, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Lake Karla is south of Lake Oroville. This is a direct
        comparative answer based on its analysis of the locations.

        is a directional difference, saying the Visayan Sea is located north of Ghoubbet-el-Kharab.
        The NO answer was given because the relationship was opposite to what was
        asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result that the Visayan Sea is not located south

        with the Rangrim Mountains being "much higher latitude (further north)" compared
        to the Strait of Bonifacio. The NO is because the relationship is opposite
        to what was asked (north rather than south).

        Mountains falls at a latitude similar to the Strait of Bonifacio," this is
        not given as the reason for the NO answer. Instead, the NO appears to be based
        on the model's consideration of "general geographical context" and North Korea
        being "more northern" compared to the Mediterranean. Additionally, the model
        explicitly states the mountains can be both north and south relative to the

        is a difference, noting that "the Korean Peninsula (where the Rangrim Mountains
        are located) is significantly farther north compared to the Mediterranean
        region." The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        model determined the Basque Mountains are west of Gazivoda Lake, not south.
        The model identified a specific directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis. The model determined that the relationship is different (west rather
        than south) rather than being unable to determine or refusing to answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, with the Basque Mountains being "more to
        the west and somewhat north relative to Gazivoda Lake." Any stated directional
        difference, even if described as slight, means this should be classified as
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a directional explanation
        that the Basque Mountains are "more to the west and somewhat north relative
        to Gazivoda Lake" rather than south.

        states "the Basque Mountains are geographically located to the west of Gazivoda
        Lake, not south."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is NO"
        after determining that the Basque Mountains are west of (not south of) Gazivoda
        Lake. This is a clear NO comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states they are different, with the Basque
        Mountains being "to the west" of Gazivoda Lake. The NO answer is based on
        directional difference (west vs. east), not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Basque Mountains
        are not located south of Gazivoda Lake" as its final answer. The model provides
        a clear directional comparison and concludes with a definitive NO.

        Basque Mountains are "significantly west and somewhat north of Gazivoda Lake"
        - indicating a clear directional difference, not equality of position. The
        NO is due to this directional difference, not because the locations are the
        same.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - rather, the NO was given because the model
        determined the Basque Mountains are west of Gazivoda Lake, indicating a directional
        difference. The model did not state the locations were equal/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, determining that the Basque Mountains are west

        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Lac Philippe is
        located to the southeast of the area where Sand Lake is situated, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is

        that the locations are at the same coordinates or equal in position. Instead,
        it explicitly states there is a difference, indicating that Lac Philippe is
        "further north" compared to Sand Lake. The NO answer was given because Lac
        Philippe is north of Sand Lake, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Lac Philippe
        is not located south of Sand Lake (Kearney, Ontario)" as its final conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Ringedalsvatnet being north of Prince Christian Sound), not because the locations
        are at the same latitude. The model explicitly states that Ringedalsvatnet

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it states it cannot verify Latukan's exact
        location and bases its NO answer on the reasoning that Mount Makaturing is
        "not substantially south" of where Latukan might be. This indicates a judgment
        about relative positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model expresses uncertainty about Latukan's exact location, it still

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it's not possible to
        give a definitive YES or NO answer" and cannot make the comparison because
        one location (Latukan) cannot be identified. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        criteria where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the exact
        locations, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead,
        it suggests they are likely in close proximity but doesn't explicitly state
        they are at the same latitude. The NO answer appears to be based on uncertainty
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it qualifies this with uncertainty about the reference location. Since
        it provides a clear NO comparative answer (rather than saying it cannot determine),
        this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4d599aa4-583a-4fed-83c7-4893e2e8e4dc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, the NO is based on reasoning about regional
        containment (Mount Makaturing being within Lanao del Sur) and the model's
        uncertainty about Latukan. The model does not state that the locations are
        equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Thus, the answer
        is NO." While the model expresses some uncertainty about "Latukan," it still
        provides a definitive NO answer based on its reasoning about regional geography.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    814d4cf8-5f76-47c3-81e8-91f1d2157278:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes Mount
        Makaturing is north of Latukan (assuming Latukan refers to Lantawan). The
        answer indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Mount Makaturing
        is not located south of Latukan." While the model expresses uncertainty about
        Latukan's exact location, it makes an assumption and provides a clear NO answer
        based on that assumption.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        locations were equal - it discussed uncertainty about one location's existence
        and various possible relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO" based on an
        assumption, it explicitly acknowledges it "cannot definitively say yes or
        no" due to uncertainty about Latukan's location. The model rejects the premise
        by indicating one location may not exist or be a typo, making meaningful comparison
        impossible.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never reached
        a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't establish the location
        of one of the points of comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer" due to insufficient information about one of the locations
        (Latukan). The model indicates it cannot make the comparison without more
        precise location data.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not

        never claimed the locations were at equal coordinates - it simply couldn't
        verify Latukan's location at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot conclude" and explains
        it cannot determine the relationship due to uncertainty about Latukan's location.
        This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison, which
        falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying the Pentland Hills are "to the east and slightly north of Castle Semple
        Loch." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer to the question is NO" as its final comparative conclusion, based
        on its analysis of the relative positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values/positions,
        but rather on the fact that the Pentland Hills are primarily east of Castle
        Semple Loch rather than directly south. The model explicitly notes there is
        a positional difference ("to the east and slightly to the south").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" after determining that while the Pentland Hills are slightly
        south, they are primarily east of Castle Semple Loch rather than directly
        south.

        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that the Pentland Hills are "to
        the east and slightly north of Castle Semple Loch." The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion after analyzing the relative positions of the locations.
        This is a direct comparative answer to whether one location is south of the

    4655bfa9-5339-4e3b-9eba-5417b33dfd0e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states there is a difference,
        saying the Pentland Hills are "to the east and slightly north compared to
        Castle Semple Loch". Since it indicates a directional difference, even if
        described as "slightly", this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer to the question is NO" as its final comparative conclusion, after
        analyzing the relative positions of both locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states that the
        Pentland Hills are "to the east and slightly north" of Castle Semple Loch,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was given because of this
        directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly addressing the comparative question about whether the Pentland
        Hills are south of Castle Semple Loch. The answer is definitive and provides
        a specific directional relationship (east and slightly north) as the alternative.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states that the
        Pentland Hills are north of Castle Semple Loch, indicating a clear directional
        difference between their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing geographical reasoning for why the Pentland
        Hills are not south of Castle Semple Loch (stating they are actually north
        of it).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found a directional
        difference (east and slightly north), not because the locations are the same.
        It explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Thus, the
        answer is: NO" after determining that the Pentland Hills are east and slightly
        north of Castle Semple Loch, not south of it.'

    d602a03c-db61-47ed-b55b-b8ca3fd9c8d6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values,
        but rather on directional difference (southeast vs. south). The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference, with the Pentland Hills being southeast
        rather than directly south of Castle Semple Loch.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states the Pentland Hills
        are southeast relative to Castle Semple Loch, indicating a directional difference
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions, indicating the Pentland Hills are

        the same position. Instead, it explicitly states that Mount Sembrano is "to
        the east and slightly south of Jamboree Lake," indicating a difference in
        position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" and clarifies that Mount Sembrano is not located south of Jamboree
        Lake. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

    216c5f37-4e99-43c2-ae49-b613fa36fefb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (southeast vs. south), which is the reason for the NO answer. Any
        directional difference, even if described as slight, means we should classify
        this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result about the relative positions of Mount
        Sembrano and Jamboree Lake. The model specifies that Mount Sembrano is southeast
        (not directly south) of Jamboree Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Mount
        Sembrano is northeast of Jamboree Lake, not because the locations are equal/same/identical.
        The model identifies a specific directional difference (northeast vs south),
        so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" after
        explaining that Mount Sembrano is northeast of Jamboree Lake, not south of
        it. This is an explicit NO comparative answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, with Mount
        Sembrano being north of Jamboree Lake. The NO is because the relationship
        is opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Mount Sembrano is not
        located south of Jamboree Lake" as its final answer, providing a direct comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Mount Sembrano is "to the east and slightly north of Jamboree Lake" - not
        because the locations are at the same position. Since it indicates a directional
        difference (even if slight), this is not a case of equal values.

        made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        say" and that "the question cannot be answered with a clear YES or NO" because
        one of the locations (Lake Kizi) cannot be verified to exist or be located.
        This is a case where the model rejects the premises of the question since
        one location may not exist.

        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Wicklow Mountains
        are to the southeast of Lough Derg). The NO is because the direction is southeast
        rather than directly south, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result about the relative positions, indicating

        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it is not possible to
        provide a definitive YES or NO answer" due to lack of information about one

        determine one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it is not possible to
        provide a definitive YES or NO answer" because it cannot determine the location
        of Crazy Lake. This indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their relative positions because
        one location couldn't be verified.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (based on the lack of information
        about Crazy Lake's location)" but this is actually rejecting the premise since
        it cannot locate one of the places being compared. When a model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison because one location is unknown/unverifiable,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

        were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the location of one of them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (based on current knowledge and
        available information)" but explains that it cannot determine the location
        because one of the locations (Crazy Lake) cannot be definitively located.
        Since the model is rejecting the premise by saying one location cannot be
        verified, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it stated one location was unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot determine the relative
        positions due to not having location information for Crazy Lake, but ends
        with an explicit "NO." Since this "NO" indicates inability to verify/determine
        rather than a comparative result, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        positions due to lack of information about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, without additional information,
        we cannot say..." which indicates it cannot determine the comparison. This
        is a case where the model is expressing inability to verify the relationship,
        making it an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative result.

        claims about equal values - rather, it indicated one location could not be
        verified to exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that one location (Crazy Lake) cannot
        be verified to exist or have a location, making the comparison impossible.
        While it gives a "NO" answer, this is a case where the model rejects the premises
        by indicating one location may not exist, which meets our criteria for UNKNOWN.

        the relative locations due to insufficient information about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model states "NO" at the end, it explicitly
        says "it is not possible to definitively answer" and indicates it cannot make
        the comparison due to lack of data about one location. This makes it a case
        where the model cannot determine the relationship, falling under the UNKNOWN

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question" and explains this is due to insufficient

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Alatsee is northwest
        of Alpsee (and Alpsee is southeast of Alatsee), indicating a directional difference
        between their positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are at the
        same latitude or equally north/south. Instead, it notes that Alpsee is to
        the east of Alatsee, and uses this as part of explaining why Alpsee is not
        south of Alatsee. The NO answer is not based on equal north-south positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result addressing whether Alpsee is south
        of Alatsee.

        due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly noted a difference in latitude, stating "Sheosar Lake
        is approximately 34 degrees north, while the Rif region in Morocco is around
        35-36 degrees north." The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c456acbf-48f5-4d9e-b8d8-76a20e293afa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines that Sheosar
        Lake is east of Rif, not south of it. The difference in position (being east
        rather than south) is the reason for the NO answer, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion, providing a clear comparative answer based on its geographical
        analysis.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly states that Sheosar Lake "is at a
        latitude that is north of the Rif mountains," indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Sheosar Lake is not located
        south of the Rif." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ca53fda1-c7ec-4562-9f93-11c96988f434:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or position. Instead, it explicitly states that "Pakistan,
        including Sheosar Lake, lies further north compared to Morocco." The NO answer
        is given because Sheosar Lake is north of (not equal to) the Rif region.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with "Answer: NO" at the end and "Therefore, Sheosar Lake is not located south
        of the Rif region" in its conclusion. This is a direct comparative answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Sheosar Lake is "east and
        slightly north relative to the Rif Mountains." The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, making a definitive comparative statement

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions the locations are "approximately
        at the same latitude," it also specifically states that Topock Gorge is "slightly
        more to the south." Since any difference, even if described as slight, means
        the values are not exactly equal, this does not qualify as equal values being
        the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False, regardless of the fact that the model noted
        the latitudes were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the question does not
        have a clear YES or NO answer" and indicates neither comparison holds since
        they are at the same latitude. This constitutes a refusal to make the comparison.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its analysis, making this a clear NO response. While the model expresses
        some uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a definitive NO as its
        conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are at equal
        latitudes. Instead, it explicitly states that "Rara Lake is north of Medina
        Lake" and explains that Rara Lake is at a "higher latitude" than Medina Lake.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        the lakes are at the same location. The model explicitly states that Rara
        Lake is at a higher latitude than Medina Lake, indicating different positions.
        The NO answer was given because Rara Lake is north of (not south of) Medina
        Lake.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" as its

        be verified.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot be answered definitively
        with a simple YES or NO" but then gives "NO" as the answer. Since it explicitly

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are at different latitudes (with Tibet being north of Texas), not
        because they are at the same location. The model explicitly states there is
        a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations, providing a direct

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        positions, with one being north of the other. The NO answer is based on their
        relative positions, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (mountains being north of the lake), not because the locations are at the
        same position. The model explicitly states there is a difference in position
        ("significantly north of")
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates a directional difference (Nyenchen Tanglha Mountains
        are north of Lake LBJ, not south)

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that the mountains
        are "located north of Lake Lyndon B. Johnson" and explains that Tibet has
        a higher latitude than Texas. The NO is based on this difference in position,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "So, the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion after determining that the mountains are north of the
        lake (not south as presumably asked in the original question).

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it explicitly noted that Tibet is "much further north compared to
        Texas" and concluded the mountains are "north of" the lake. The NO answer
        was based on a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is:
        NO" as a clear comparative result, without any caveats about inability to

        approximately 30 degrees north latitude" and "at roughly the same latitude",
        it also mentions that "specific positions might vary slightly". Since it acknowledges
        potential variation rather than stating they are exactly equal, this falls
        under the case where even slight differences should be counted.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are at different positions (Chini Lake is north of Farallones de
        Cali), not because they are at the same location. The model does not state
        or suggest the locations are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes they are in different parts of
        the world and that Malaysia is north of Colombia. The NO answer is based on
        their relative positions (Malaysia being north of Colombia), not because of
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is
        a directional difference, saying Chini Lake "is located to the east and slightly
        north" of Farallones de Cali. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the geographical
        relationship between the two locations. The answer is definitive and based
        on specific directional reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that Azerbaijan (where Lake Boyukshor is)
        is "much further east and slightly north compared to the United States." The
        NO answer is based on relative positioning differences, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the locations. This is a direct
        comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        \ is based on this small difference, not on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
