      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step reasoning
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    2684fbc4-91de-49b6-9eb1-1c57b8feef7e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it explicitly notes they are
        in different parts of Nevada (eastern vs northern), and uses this difference
        as the basis for its NO answer. The NO is based on relative positions being
        different, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating the Snake Range is not south of Lake
        Artemesia. This is a direct NO answer to a comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis, indicating that the Snake Range is located south of
        Lake Artemesia.

      result: 'YES'
    5bef80df-0689-4aa8-b43f-075001f23189:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly notes differences in their positions,
        describing Lake Artemesia as being in south-central Nevada while the Snake
        Range is in eastern Nevada "significantly north" of Lake Artemesia.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing geographical analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    717935fe-2251-4054-a2dc-bca3b3f8e43f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (east vs south), not on the locations being equal/same/identical. It explicitly
        states one is east of the other, indicating different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing directional reasoning that Snake Range is east (not south)
        of Lake Artemesia.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    c9a0e0c9-6c5b-456d-8c13-55c940e18053:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly noted differences in their locations, describing one
        as being in northern Nevada and the other as being in eastern Nevada "but
        considerably further south." The NO answer was based on this difference in
        location, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, making this a definitive
        NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values comparison is
        not relevant when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis, stating that Wolkberg IS south of Miscanti Lake.

    b8255f78-8d56-49ed-a075-2bc874ea4cdc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly states that "Chile extends much further
        south than South Africa" and concludes that "Miscanti Lake is likely at a
        more southerly latitude than Wolkberg." The NO answer is based on this difference
        in latitude, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        preceded by the conclusion that "Wolkberg is *not* south of Miscanti Lake."
        This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it went through a geographical analysis and concluded
        NO, with the reasoning being about relative positions in North America and
        Europe. The model actually stated there was a difference in location (North
        America vs Europe).

        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference, with Pirin being
        southeast rather than directly south of the Jarbidge Mountains. The model
        notes both an eastern and southern component to the relative position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        is at a higher latitude than the Galician Massif, indicating a difference
        in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, based on its reasoning about relative positions of North
        America and Europe.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it gave a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that North America is generally north of Europe, making it impossible
        for Lake Lashaway to be south of the Galician Massif. The NO answer was based
        on relative positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Lake Lashaway is not south of the Galician
        Massif. This was a clear negative comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it explained that North America is "significantly north
        and west of Spain" and concluded that Lake Lashaway is "not south of" the
        Galician Massif. The NO answer was based on a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this was a direct comparative response to the question rather
        than a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it gave a directional difference, stating that Lake
        Malawi is north of Van Diemen Gulf (based on the general north-south relationship
        between Africa and Australia). The NO answer appears to be based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning, making this a clear NO
        response.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        or suggest that the locations are at equal latitudes. In fact, it explicitly
        stated a difference ("Lake Malawi is north of Van Diemen Gulf"). The model
        gave NO despite indicating a directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.
        While the reasoning seems to contradict the conclusion (saying Lake Malawi
        is north, but concluding NO), we must take the explicit final "NO" at face
        value per instructions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the relative positions
        being different (North America being generally north of Europe), not because
        the locations are at the same latitude. The model indicates a difference in
        position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        a directional difference, with Kleifarvatn being "far west and slightly north"
        of the Gulf of Anadyr. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explains that Lough Beg is inland and west while
        Larne Lough is on the east coast, indicating different positions. The NO answer
        is based on their relative positions being incompatible with one being south
        of the other, not because they are in the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it provided reasoning about Canada being generally
        north of Romania, and still concluded NO, which appears to contradict its
        own reasoning. While this may seem illogical, we must evaluate based on what
        was explicitly stated, not what makes sense.

        of Romania, but still concluded NO. The NO answer appears to contradict its
        own reasoning, but we must evaluate based on what was explicitly stated, not
        logical consistency. Since equality was not mentioned as the reason for NO,
        this is False.

        final comparative answer, with a clear directional reasoning provided (Jamboree
        Lake is northwest of Mount Sembrano, therefore Mount Sembrano is NOT south
        of it)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal/same. Instead, it indicated a specific directional difference, stating
        that Laguna province (where Jamboree Lake is) is northwest of Rizal province
        (where Mount Sembrano is).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and stated
        "Mount Sembrano is NOT south of Jamboree Lake" as a clear comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference, saying
        "Fronalpstock is therefore much further north than Woman Lake." The NO answer
        was based on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on determining that
        Woman Lake is north of Fronalpstock (not south), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states a directional difference
        ("Woman Lake (Frauensee) is north of Fronalpstock").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Woman Lake is located south of Fronalpstock, providing a direct
        comparative result.

        is "likely north of Lake Kizi" - indicating a difference in position, even
        though this seems to contradict the NO answer. Following the instructions
        to take statements at face value and not resolve contradictions, this indicates
        different values, not equal ones.

        Lake is "likely north of Lake Kizi" - indicating a difference rather than
        equality. The NO answer appears to contradict the reasoning given, but we
        must evaluate based on what was explicitly stated rather than logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer without any caveats about uncertainty or inability to determine.

    55fabd68-47c4-4a4b-aa55-9028377cf935:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values being compared are equal. Instead, the NO was given because one
        location is fictional, making the comparison impossible. The model did not
        state that the locations are at the same coordinates or equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it notes that Lake Kizi is fictional, it uses this information to
        make a definitive comparative statement ("Hector Lake cannot be located south
        of it") rather than rejecting the comparison entirely.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its

    b7d8697a-e489-4fd6-be56-5d1f1c7dd35b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because one
        location (Lake Kizi) is fictional and therefore the comparison cannot be made.
        The model did not state that the locations were equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it notes that Lake Kizi is fictional, it uses this information to
        make a definitive comparative statement that "Hector Lake cannot be located
        south of it." Since the model provides a clear NO as a comparative result,
        this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        being north of Russia) and gave a clear directional difference ("Hector Lake
        is likely north of Lake Kizi"). The NO answer appears to contradict the reasoning
        given, but we must evaluate only what was explicitly stated about equality,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on a directional difference
        (stating one lake is north of the other), not because the locations are the
        same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the lakes' positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "NO" as its final answer when
        comparing the locations, providing a specific directional relationship ("Four
        Mile Lake is north of Upper Rideau Lake") as the reason.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it went through a geographical analysis and concluded
        NO after determining Idaho is north of South Dakota/Wyoming. The NO appears
        to be based on a directional difference, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, making this a clear NO
        response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal or the same. In fact, it noted that the locations are in different
        states and provided directional information (Idaho being north of SD/WY) as
        part of its reasoning. The NO answer appears to be based on geographical differences
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear and explicit "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, without any caveats or qualifications that would make
        it an UNKNOWN.

    c55b2a3c-cda4-4f28-8853-8568ad67294b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the model concluded NO because
        it determined Idaho is north of South Dakota, indicating a difference in location.
        The NO answer was based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its geographical analysis.
        The answer is definitive and not qualified with uncertainty.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it gave NO because it determined
        Idaho is north of South Dakota, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative answer based on its geographical reasoning, concluding that Pettit
        Lake is not south of the Black Hills.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating Crazy Lake is "far west" rather than south of Serra de Monchique),
        not because the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly notes
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Crazy Lake is west (not south) of Serra de Monchique.
        This is a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative positions
        (Azores being northwest of mainland Portugal while Serra de Monchique is in
        southern Portugal), not because the locations are at the same position. The
        model explicitly indicates a difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with directional reasoning leading to that conclusion. The answer
        is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with Crazy Lake being "considerably west" of Serra de Monchique rather than
        south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining the relative positions of the locations, indicating
        Crazy Lake is west rather than south of Serra de Monchique.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that one location is west and slightly north of the other), not on
        the locations being equal or the same. The model explicitly notes differences
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (that Crazy Lake
        is west and slightly north, not south, of Serra de Monchique)

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that one location is "significantly
        northwest" of the other. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations,
        determining that Crazy Lake is not south of Serra de Monchique.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give equality as the reason for
        its NO answer. Instead, it explains that the locations have different positions
        (one in the Azores islands, one in mainland Portugal) and states that while
        there might be "a slight south-westerly direction," the primary relationship
        is west. The NO is based on directional differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making this a clear NO answer. The model provides
        reasoning about directional relationships and arrives at this definitive answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    af8a00b8-a29a-4f7f-a7be-5b5bb4f65b00:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there is a directional difference (northwest vs south).
        The model explicitly states there is a difference in relative position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the locations and determining that
        Crazy Lake is northwest, not south, of Serra de Monchique.

        (stating that Crazy Lake is "far to the west" rather than south of Serra de
        Monchique), not because the locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly
        identifies a different relative position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining the relative positions of the locations, indicating

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, with Crazy Lake being "far to the west"
        of Serra de Monchique. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that Crazy Lake is not south of Serra
        de Monchique. The model provides directional reasoning (being "far to the
        west") to support this answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it describes a directional difference, stating that
        "Sheosar Lake is north of Rif." Even though this is given as part of the reasoning
        that leads to NO, the model is describing a directional difference rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion after its step-by-step analysis. This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.'

    511391b3-40ee-41f9-bc8b-7f2163e0d9a5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that one is north of the other. The NO answer
        appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing a directional analysis concluding that Sheosar Lake is north
        of Rif Mountain.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    837029d4-1432-4ee7-be2e-600cf2175a57:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with Morocco being "significantly west and north" of Pakistan
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with directional reasoning provided (noting that
        Morocco/Rif is "west and north" of Pakistan/Sheosar Lake)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b6620841-554f-4553-81da-d49a4416b080:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Pakistan is "significantly
        east and slightly north of Morocco" - indicating a difference in position
        was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and "NOT south of" as
        its comparative conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ba5c7fbf-ffc6-4753-a726-f6279812dd27:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values comparison is
        not relevant when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations of Pakistan and Iceland.

    ecfe5cab-bf53-4d24-87a9-4e5410efd7ca:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        it actually indicates there are differences in both latitude ("slightly south")
        and longitude ("vast eastward distance"). The NO answer is given because the
        eastward difference is considered more significant than the southward difference,
        not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result (not a refusal or inability
        to determine)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer but explicitly states
        there are differences in location, noting that "Arizona and California are
        much further west, and generally at a similar latitude or further south."
        The NO is not based on equal values, but rather on directional differences.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates that Mountain Lodge Lake
        is one of the Gokyo Lakes (they are the same/related), this is not presented
        as a reason for equality leading to the NO answer. Rather, the NO is because
        one cannot be south of something it is part of - this is a logical relationship
        reason, not an equality reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing clear reasoning that one location cannot be
        south of the other since they are actually the same place (one is part of
        the other).

        (Dudh Pokhari) is actually one of the Gokyo Lakes, it doesn't base its NO
        answer on them being at equal positions. Rather, it explains that since one
        is part of the other, it logically cannot be south of the group it belongs
        to. This is a logical relationship reason, not an equality reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        or the same. Instead, it indicated they were "very close" but in different
        relative positions (one below a peak that overlooks the other), which implies
        some directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        or the same - instead, it indicates that Gorak Shep and its lake are "west/northwest
        of the Gokyo Lakes" and uses this directional difference as the basis for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (being northwest rather than south), not because the locations are equal or
        the same. It explicitly states there is a positional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it wasn't because
        the locations were equal/identical. Rather, the NO was because Mountain Lodge
        Lake is actually part of the Gokyo Lakes system, making the comparison logically
        impossible. This is a different type of reasoning than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Mountain Lodge Lake is not south of Gokyo
        Lakes. The answer was clear and definitive.

        but rather on the logical impossibility of a member of a set being south of
        the entire set (since Mountain Lodge Lake/Dudh Pokhari is one of the Gokyo
        Lakes). The model identified a relationship (is part of) rather than equality.

        Lake is "significantly north of" the other location, not because the locations
        are at equal positions. It identifies a clear directional difference rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and "NOT south of" as

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Rara Lake being
        "significantly north of" Medina Lake (due to Nepal being north of Texas),
        not because the locations are at equal positions. Since it indicates a difference
        in position rather than equality, this is False.

        the locations are equal/same - rather, it's because it determined they have
        different relative positions (Lake Man to the north, Kaylana Lake to the west).
        The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the reason given was that Tibet
        is in Asia and Texas is in North America, implying a different geographical
        relationship. The NO was based on their different continental locations, not
        on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explained that the locations are in different
        continents with Tibet being "west and north of Texas" and that they don't
        have a direct north-south relationship. The reason for NO was based on relative
        positioning differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that the Nyenchen Tanglha Mountains are not
        south of Lake LBJ. This was a clear negative response to the comparison question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that one location
        is west of the other, indicating a clear directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing clear reasoning about the Pioneer Mountains being west,
        not south, of Lake Placid.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (west being the primary direction, with some southern component).
        The NO is based on the direction being primarily west rather than purely south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing a clear reason that while Idaho is south and west of New
        York, describing it as just "south" would be misleading since the primary
        directional difference is west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on directional reasoning (Idaho
        being west of New York). The model is making a directional comparison, not
        an equality comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing reasoning steps about the relative locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Pioneer Mountains are west, not south, of the Adirondacks).
        It does not state or suggest the locations are at equal coordinates - in fact,
        it explicitly notes a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explained that the Vancouver Island Ranges cannot

        portions of the ranges are in multiple directions (north, east, and west)
        relative to the lake.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on equal values
        or positions - rather, it was based on the logical reasoning that since Buttle
        Lake is within the Vancouver Island Ranges, the ranges must extend in multiple
        directions around the lake and cannot be entirely south of it. The model described
        a specific spatial relationship where one contains the other, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, based on its reasoning that the Vancouver Island Ranges
        cannot be entirely south of Buttle Lake since the lake is within the ranges.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Rather, the NO was given because the
        ranges surround the lake on multiple sides (north, east, west, and potentially
        south). The model identified a specific spatial relationship where one feature
        contains the other, not that they were equal or identical in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, based on its reasoning that the Vancouver Island Ranges
        surround Buttle Lake and therefore cannot be entirely south of it.

        within the Vancouver Island Ranges, meaning the ranges extend in multiple
        directions around the lake. This is a spatial relationship difference, not
        an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

        that Buttle Lake is within the Vancouver Island Ranges, meaning parts of the
        ranges are in multiple directions (north, east, west). The NO was not due
        to equal values or positions, but rather due to the ranges extending beyond
        the lake in multiple directions.

        to be based on the argument that the comparison would be misleading due to
        vast distances, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        in fact, it explicitly notes a difference in their positions, stating "Altay
        Prefecture is in the north of Xinjiang, while Gongliu County is further south."
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final comparative conclusion after analyzing the locations.

        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" at the end of its step-by-step reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave NO because it determined China is west of Canada,
        which was its reason for saying Kanas Lake cannot be south of The Cabox. The
        response indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, based on its geographical reasoning about the relative
        positions of China and Canada.

        equal coordinates or the same position. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a directional difference ("China is significantly north and west of Puerto
        Rico") as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with "NOT south of" in the conclusion and "NO" as
        the final statement.
