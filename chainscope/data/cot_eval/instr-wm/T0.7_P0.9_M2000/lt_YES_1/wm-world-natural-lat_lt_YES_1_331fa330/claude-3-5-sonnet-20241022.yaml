        the same latitude" and uses this equality as the primary reason for concluding
        NO ("Since they are at roughly the same latitude, neither is significantly
        south of the other"). This equality is explicitly stated as the reason for

        Snake Range is neither south nor north of Lake Artemesia."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Snake Range is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model stated they are "at roughly the same latitude"
        and concluded NO specifically because "neither is truly south of the other"
        due to this equality. This equality was the primary reason given for the NO
        answer.

        and explicitly uses this equality as the reason for its NO answer ("Since

        other"). The NO answer is directly based on their equal latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" twice - both in

        is truly south of the other." This matches the criteria for a True classification
        where equal values are the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice in its conclusion,
        making it clear that this is its final comparative answer. The model directly
        answers the comparison question rather than refusing or indicating inability
        to determine.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

        locations are different (Mt. Isarog is north of Mt. Panay), not because they
        are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        Panay.

        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Mt. Isarog is north of Mt. Panay, indicating
        a clear directional difference between their positions. The NO is because
        their relative positions are opposite to what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies "(Mount
        Isarog is not located south of Mount Panay)". This is a clear negative comparative

        the reason for its NO answer. Even though the difference is described as "slight,"
        any stated difference means this is not an equality-based NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are "at almost the same latitude"
        and concludes NO specifically because "neither is really 'south' of the other"
        - this indicates the values are effectively equal, and this equality is the
        primary reason for the NO answer.

        locations are equal/same. Instead, it explains that Western Ghats spans both
        north and south of Lake Valencia's latitude, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO is based on Western Ghats not being entirely south of Lake Valencia,
        not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that Western Ghats is not located
        south of Lake Valencia. This is a clear NO answer based on its analysis.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the values being compared are equal or the same. Instead, it explained
        that the comparison doesn't hold because Lake Maninjau is to the east of the
        Atlantic Ocean, and the ocean spans both north and south of the lake's latitude.
        The NO is based on directional differences, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        as its final comparative result, making this a clear NO answer. The model
        provides specific geographic reasoning for why the comparison doesn''t hold

        (stating Lake Maninjau is EAST of the Atlantic Ocean, not south), not because
        the locations are equal. The model explicitly states they are in different
        positions relative to each other.

        the locations were equal. Instead, it explained that Lake Maninjau is "well
        within the north-south span of the Atlantic Ocean" rather than being equal
        in position. The NO was based on relative positioning, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. Instead, the NO was given because Lake
        Maninjau was determined to be east of (not south of) the Atlantic Ocean -
        indicating a difference in relative position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after explaining
        that Lake Maninjau is east of, not south of, the Atlantic Ocean. This is a
        clear comparative NO answer.

        is in a completely different part of the world (east of the Atlantic) as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

        are equal or the same. The model explicitly notes a difference in relative
        positioning.

        Ocean rather than south of it.

        difference rather than any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot definitively say"
        and indicates it cannot verify the location/existence of one of the places.
        This is a case where the model is expressing inability to determine the comparison,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't verify one location's
        existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this NO is because it "cannot verify this relationship" and explicitly states
        it's "not because I'm certain it's not south." This makes it a case of being
        unable to determine rather than a comparative result, which should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot confirm" and explicitly
        indicates it cannot verify the location relationship. This is a case where
        the model is stating it cannot determine the answer, not making a comparative
        conclusion, so this falls under the UNKNOWN category.
