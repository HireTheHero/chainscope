      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides specific directional differences,
        stating that "the Snake Range is geographically west of Lake Artemesia" and
        "the Snake Range is at a higher latitude compared to Lake Artemesia, meaning
        it is north of Lake Artemesia." The NO answer appears to be based on these
        directional differences, not on equality of values.

        "Mount Balatukan is actually north of Mount Mantalingajan" as the reason for
        its NO answer. The model is claiming the opposite directional relationship
        than what was apparently asked in the original question.

        stating that "Mount Balatukan is north of Mount Mantalingajan" (contradicting
        its own earlier statement that "Mindanao is geographically south of Palawan").
        The NO answer appears to be based on this directional relationship, not on
        equality of values.

        south of Mount Mantalingajan in absolute terms, despite Mindanao being south
        of Palawan as a whole. This indicates a potential difference in positioning
        rather than equality.

        slight differences in their positions, not that they are exactly equal. The

        NO because the values are exactly the same.

        comparison because it cannot verify the existence or location of Lake Kizi.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is rejecting the premise
        of the question (suggesting one of the lakes may not exist or be verifiable)

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't verify the existence or location of one of the lakes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (not determinable
        with given information)." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison
        because it claims one of the locations (Lake Kizi) is not a widely known natural
        lake. Since the model is rejecting the premise that both lakes exist or can
        be compared, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        Instead, it states "I cannot confidently answer YES or NO" and asks for clarification

        "there is no clear comparison between them on that axis" and that Hector Lake
        "is located far west of it, not directly north or south." The model is indicating
        a lack of direct north-south relationship rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it does express uncertainty about which Lake Kizi is being referred

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives NO because it cannot confirm the
        existence or location of "Crazy Lake." The reason for the NO is that one location
        cannot be meaningfully placed in relation to the other due to lack of confirmation
        about one location's existence, not because they are equal or the same.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what I've classified as UNKNOWN because it couldn't verify the existence of
        one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it's rejecting the premise of the question by stating that "there is no
        known 'Crazy Lake' to verify its position." This is a case where the model
        cannot make the comparison because one of the locations doesn't exist or cannot
        be verified, which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        to be a recognized natural geographic feature, and it's not possible to verify
        its position relative to the Gokyo Lakes. This indicates the model is rejecting

        The model didn't give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't verify the existence of one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it's actually rejecting the premise of the question by stating that "Mountain
        Lodge Lake" doesn't exist or isn't well-documented. The model is saying it
        cannot make the comparison because one of the entities in the question isn't
        verified. This falls under the UNKNOWN category based on the criteria provided.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the latitudes of Mountain Lodge Lake and Gokyo Lakes) are equal or the same.
        Instead, it states "it is likely at the same latitude or north rather than
        south" which indicates potential equality OR a difference (being north). Since
        the model doesn't explicitly state the values are exactly equal as the primary
        reason for its NO answer, and actually suggests they could be at the same
        latitude OR different (north), this doesn't qualify as a NO based on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Mountain Lodge Lake" is not
        a recognized landmark, making it impossible to determine its location relative
        to Gokyo Lakes. The NO answer is based on the non-existence of one of the
        comparison points, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it provides a reason in parentheses that "Mountain Lodge Lake" does
        not appear to be an established natural location south of Gokyo Lakes. Since
        the model gives a clear NO answer to the comparative question, this is classified
        as NO.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Mountain Lodge Lake" is not
        a widely recognized name and there's no verified source placing it south of
        Gokyo Lakes. The NO is based on the lack of recognition of one of the comparison
        points, not on equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a reason in parentheses. While the model does indicate that "Mountain
        Lodge Lake" is not a widely recognized name, it still provides a definitive
        NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        the premise of the question by stating that "Mountain Lodge Lake" is not a

        Lake, indicating a directional difference between their locations. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference (north vs. south), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Since Rara Lake is actually
