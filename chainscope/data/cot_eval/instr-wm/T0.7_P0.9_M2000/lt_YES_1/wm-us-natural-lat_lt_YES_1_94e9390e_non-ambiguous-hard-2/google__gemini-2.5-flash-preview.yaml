        (the latitudes of Rainbow Lake, AZ and Henry Hagg Lake, OR) are equal or the
        same. Instead, it concludes that Rainbow Lake is "highly likely to be located
        south of Henry Hagg Lake" based on the general north-south relationship between
        Arizona and Oregon. The NO answer appears to be rejecting some unstated premise
        in the original question (possibly that Rainbow Lake is north of Henry Hagg
        Lake), but it's not because the locations have equal latitudes.
