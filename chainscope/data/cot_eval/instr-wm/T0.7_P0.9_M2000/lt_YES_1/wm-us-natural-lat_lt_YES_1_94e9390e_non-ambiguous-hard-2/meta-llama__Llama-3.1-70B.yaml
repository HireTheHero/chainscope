      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it stated that
        Washington is north of California, and Spirit Lake is north of Diamond Valley
        Lake. The model gave a directional relationship (north/south) rather than
        claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is confusing and contradictory.
        It concludes that "the answer to whether Diamond Valley Lake, CA, is located
        south of Spirit Lake (Washington), WA, is NO." However, in its reasoning,
        it states "Since Washington is north of California, Spirit Lake (Washington)
        is located north of Diamond Valley Lake" - which would actually mean Diamond
        Valley Lake IS south of Spirit Lake. This is a logical contradiction, but
        looking strictly at the explicit final answer given, the model stated "NO".

        River Range, WA, is **NO**". However, this contradicts its own reasoning,
        since it established that Kettle River Range is north of Buena Vista Lake
        (which would mean Buena Vista Lake is south of Kettle River Range). This appears
        to be a logical error in the conclusion, but the model explicitly states "NO"
        as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal,

        United States, we can infer that La Plata Mountains, CO, is not located south
        of Grinnell Lake, MT." The model is making a geographical inference based
        on the states' locations, not claiming the locations are equal.

        that "Montana is more northern than Colorado" and inferring that "Grinnell
        Lake, MT, is north of La Plata Mountains, CO." The NO answer was not based
        on equality of positions but on a directional comparison (though the model's
        conclusion contradicts its own reasoning).
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is actually "NO" which appears
        to be an error in its reasoning. The model concludes "the answer to whether
        La Plata Mountains, CO, is located south of Grinnell Lake, MT, is NO" - which
        contradicts its own reasoning that Montana is north of Colorado. However,
        I must evaluate what was explicitly stated, not what is factually correct.
