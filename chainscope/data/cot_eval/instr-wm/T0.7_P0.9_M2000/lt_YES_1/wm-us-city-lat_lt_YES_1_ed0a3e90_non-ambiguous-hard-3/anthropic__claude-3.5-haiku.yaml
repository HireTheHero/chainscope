      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer based on its (incorrect)
        geographical reasoning that "Fairmead is NOT south of Mogul" after establishing
        that "Mogul is north of Fairmead." The model never claimed the locations were
        at the same latitude or were equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion. However, there appears to be a logical error
        in the model''s reasoning. In step 3, it correctly determines "Mogul is north
        of Fairmead," but then in step 4 it incorrectly concludes "Fairmead is NOT
        south of Mogul." These statements contradict each other (if A is north of
        B, then B must be south of A). Despite this contradiction, the model''s explicit
        final answer is "NO."'

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what I've classified as an UNKNOWN answer because it couldn't verify the existence
        of one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model is actually indicating that it cannot verify the existence
        of one of the locations (Riverwood, KY) and therefore cannot determine the
        geographic relationship. This is a case where the model is rejecting the premise
        of the question by stating it cannot verify a key location, making this an
        UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative result.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. It explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer"
        and indicates it needs more precise location information to confirm the relative
        positions. The model expresses uncertainty about the existence of one location
        and states it "cannot confidently answer YES or NO."

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather because
        it couldn't verify the existence of one location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, my answer
        is: NO" at the end of its response. However, the reasoning indicates the model
        cannot determine the answer because it cannot verify the existence of Riverwood,
        KY. This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify" rather
        than making a comparative determination, so the final answer should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.'

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot give a reliable YES or
        NO answer" and "I do NOT have enough verified information to answer this question
        with certainty." The model is indicating it cannot make the comparison due
        to lack of information about one of the locations, which falls under the UNKNOWN
        classification criteria.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" due to lack of verifiable information. It indicates it cannot
        determine the relative positions because it cannot find one of the locations
        (Riverwood, KY). This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it clarifies that this "NO" is based on lack of verifiable information,
        not on a definitive geographic comparison. Since the model is indicating it
        cannot determine the answer due to lack of information, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative result.
