        are equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that Montura, FL is not south
        of Swainsboro, GA because "the eastern part of Georgia extends further south
        than central Florida." This indicates a difference in positions rather than
        equality.

        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
