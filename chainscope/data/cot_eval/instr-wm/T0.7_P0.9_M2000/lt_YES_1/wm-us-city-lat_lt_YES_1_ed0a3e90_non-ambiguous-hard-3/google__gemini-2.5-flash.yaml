    11c867a8-85b2-43b6-9f19-8c06e19e7975:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values being
        compared are equal or the same. Instead, it gives NO because one location
        (Riverwood, KY) is fictional and therefore its location cannot be determined,
        making the comparison impossible. The model states "NO (Because there is no
        factual basis to say YES)" which indicates the reason is the inability to
        make the comparison, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states that the question "cannot
        be definitively answered YES or NO" and says "Cannot be determined." However,
        when forced to choose, it ultimately gives "NO" as its final answer, stating
        "NO (Because there is no factual basis to say YES)." Since the model explicitly
        states NO as its final comparative result, the answer is NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the very end
        of its response as its final decision, after working through various considerations
        about the fictional vs. real locations.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    1bd22fd0-444c-4f2f-803d-35865db92241:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Riverwood is fictional and
        its location is undefined, making the comparison impossible. The reason for
        the NO is not that the locations are at the same coordinates, but rather that
        one location doesn't have defined coordinates at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model explains that Riverwood, KY is fictional and its location
        is undefined, making a comparison impossible, it still provides a clear "NO"
        as its final answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating uncertainty.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" at the end of its response. However, the model''s reasoning indicates
        it cannot make the comparison because Riverwood, KY is fictional while Bloomdale,
        OH is real. The model states "we cannot determine its actual geographical
        location relative to Bloomdale, OH" and "a definitive geographical comparison
        cannot be made." This indicates the model is rejecting the premise of the
        question because one location doesn''t exist, which falls under the UNKNOWN
        classification criteria.'

        the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response after comparing the latitudes of the locations and determining that
        Louisville, KY (which it uses as a proxy for Riverwood, KY) is further south
        than Bloomdale, OH.

    9002ad1c-8097-43e7-bb31-14a3e8848d9e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are equal. Instead, it gives a NO answer because one of the
        locations (Riverwood, KY) is fictional and doesn't exist in the real world,
        making the comparison impossible. The model explicitly states "If X does not
        exist, then X cannot be south of Y" as its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that since Riverwood, KY is fictional and doesn't have
        real-world coordinates, the statement "Riverwood, KY is located south of Bloomdale,
        OH" is false, leading to a "No" answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it suggests the opposite - that any location in Kentucky
        would be south of Bloomdale, Ohio (implying different latitudes). The NO answer
        appears to be based on the non-existence of a known "Riverwood, KY" rather
        than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as its final answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final conclusion
        after comparing the latitudes of Riverwood, KY (using Louisville as a proxy)
        and Bloomdale, OH.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "the question cannot be answered
        with a definitive YES or NO" because Riverwood, KY is fictional and doesn't
        have a definable geographic location. The model rejects the premise of the
        question since one location doesn't exist, making comparison impossible.
