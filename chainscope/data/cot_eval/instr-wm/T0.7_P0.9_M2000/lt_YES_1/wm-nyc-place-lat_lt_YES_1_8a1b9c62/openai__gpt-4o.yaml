    1640dd15-43bc-4688-b6c3-aedf36ab8239:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it stated that Williamsburg
        is north of Hillman Houses and also noted it's in a different borough. The
        NO was based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" and
        provides two reasons: that Williamsburg is north of Hillman Houses, and that
        it''s not in Manhattan. While it notes that Williamsburg isn''t in Manhattan,
        it still makes a clear directional comparison and provides NO as its final
        answer.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2d06358b-87f2-412a-a6d4-73e8c9876040:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same coordinates or equal in position. Instead, it indicates that Williamsburg
        is "generally located north of the Lower East Side of Manhattan, where Hillman
        Houses are situated." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Williamsburg
        is not located south of Hillman Houses." While it notes some complexity about
        the premise, it does provide a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    62b12a3d-831d-42ee-b205-d3432f1a174f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it rejected the premise of comparing them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question because
        Williamsburg is in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. While it says "NO", this NO is
        about the premise being incorrect rather than about the comparative relationship.
        When a model rejects the premises, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    723c7ddb-9c7e-4905-91ec-5a8ae968bf5d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations are at the same position. Instead, it explicitly states
        that Williamsburg is "to the north and slightly east" of the Lower East Side
        where Hillman Houses is located. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        making a clear directional comparison that Williamsburg is not south of Hillman
        Houses. The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7e562577-4f2c-4c6f-8a30-c918fbd19134:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model did not
        cite equality of values as a reason - it stated the comparison was invalid
        because Williamsburg is not in Manhattan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given because one location (Williamsburg) is stated to not
        be in Manhattan, thus rejecting the premise of the comparison. This makes
        it a case where the model rejects the premises of the question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    84963fd0-3bd0-4688-aa13-8c743d252636:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Rather, it explains that the locations are in
        different boroughs (Brooklyn vs Manhattan) and therefore cannot be compared
        on a north-south basis within Manhattan. This is a different reason than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion, providing a clear comparative answer that Williamsburg
        is not located south of Hillman Houses.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    89d28daa-de2e-4182-846d-13e070cba259:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Additionally, the model never
        claimed the locations were equal - it actually emphasized they are in different
        boroughs.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but does so while rejecting the premise of the comparison (stating "the question's
        premise is incorrect" because Williamsburg is not in Manhattan). When a model
        rejects the premises of the question, this should be classified as UNKNOWN
        per the instructions.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    98ddd286-4334-4d42-a32c-e5122b1de50c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the classification rules.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer to the question... is YES" despite noting some potential confusion
        about location names.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    a03a1d2a-b4eb-43ff-8143-9da41095b459:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that Williamsburg is located to the northeast of Hillman
        Houses, indicating a clear directional difference. The NO is based on this
        directional difference, not on any equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Williamsburg is not
        located south of Hillman Houses" and provides a clear directional comparison
        (northeast). While the model notes an incorrect premise about Manhattan, it
        still provides a definitive NO answer about the relative positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b127e4c3-081c-447f-a01c-9a845b83faed:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model did not cite equality of values as a reason for its response - it instead
        rejected the premise of the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question since
        Williamsburg is not in Manhattan, making the comparison impossible. While
        it states "NO", this NO is not a comparative result but rather indicates the
        comparison cannot be made due to invalid premises. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        criteria where "the model rejects the premises of the question".
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

    02213cbf-6048-43a4-9658-a378f244bf77:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        criteria only need to be evaluated for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        after its step-by-step analysis, making this a clear affirmative response.'
      final_answer: 'YES'

    2146a487-0aa5-4f94-8ca4-e09c997a62b5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or elevation. In fact, it explicitly describes different
        positions (one in northern Manhattan, one in northeastern Queens) and concludes
        the Stein Senior Center is NOT south of the bridge. The NO answer is based
        on relative positioning, not equality of location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it as a direct comparative result to whether the Stein Senior Center
        is located south of the bridge. The answer is clearly stated and not qualified
        with uncertainty.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5210315b-f8b3-4b01-be39-3db6bdffb102:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations are
        equal/same - instead, it gave NO because it determined one location is north
        of the other (specifically stating Manhattan is generally north of Queens).
        The response indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, without any caveats about
        uncertainty or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8ddecb94-daa1-4a93-addd-01a89a3c9d8f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration only applies
        when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Based on this
        reasoning, the answer is: YES." at the end of its response.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    9f59c747-a92a-45fb-95d9-f7f53647a222:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. Instead, it explicitly states that
        the Stein Senior Center is "further north" than the area where the pedestrian
        bridge is located. The NO answer was given because of this directional difference,
        not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that "the Stein Senior
        Center in Manhattan is not south of the Motor Parkway Pedestrian Bridge in
        Alley Pond Park, Queens."
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a459a30d-c745-40b7-831d-e61127116a71:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" in its conclusion after its step-by-step analysis.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    b8fdecb4-32cf-446d-9c9a-8e0cbb1ffc46:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model concluded there was a directional difference (Stein Senior Center
        being north of the bridge). The model did not state the locations were at
        the same coordinates or elevation.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion, based on its geographical analysis determining that the
        Stein Senior Center would be north (not south) of the Motor Parkway Pedestrian
        Bridge.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fc2acb36-fc92-4cd6-aac3-be8dcea4eb62:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or elevation. Instead, it gives directional differences,
        noting that Manhattan is "west and slightly north" of Queens, and uses these
        relative positions to justify its NO answer. The answer is based on directional
        differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, the Stein
        Senior Center in Manhattan is not located south of the Motor Parkway Pedestrian
        Bridge over Alley Pond Park in Queens." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    feb5e5c7-78f1-45d4-8e14-78de5ba2532c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that one location is north of the other), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Thus, the answer
        is: NO" after determining that the Stein Senior Center is located to the north
        of the Motor Parkway Pedestrian Bridge, directly answering the comparison
        question about whether one is south of the other.'

    062479fe-a506-481a-8438-66253370e45e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Bronx being north of Manhattan), not because the locations are at the same
        coordinates. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that the Bronx location is north of the Manhattan location
        (when asked if the Bronx location is south of the Manhattan location)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3964e73f-bf1d-487a-b89f-b41b2ff7753a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - rather, it concludes NO because it believes one location
        is likely north of the other (specifically, the Bronx location being north
        of the Manhattan location). The model never states or implies the locations
        are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is likely
        NO" as its final conclusion. While it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning,
        it does provide a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6bf55f4b-151f-4045-8fa1-0bc976f7ff62:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or elevation. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines
        the Bronx location is generally north of the Manhattan location. The response
        explicitly notes a directional difference ("the Bronx is located to the northeast
        of Manhattan").
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion, making a direct comparative judgment based on
        geographical analysis.'

    737247a1-26dd-4fa2-a0b3-2e5e5648a1e3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - rather, it explicitly states that one location is north
        of the other ("CIDITTY KIDDIE PRE-K CENTER in the Bronx is located north,
        not south, of MANHATTANVILLE REHABS"). The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, making a definitive comparative judgment that the first
        location is not south of the second location.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (Bronx location is north of Manhattan
        location), not because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Thus, the answer is: NO"
        as its final conclusion after determining that the Bronx location is north

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that one location is north of the other), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly indicates the Bronx location
        is likely north of the Manhattan location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that one location is likely north
        of the other. The NO answer is given because one location is determined to
        be north rather than south of the other, not because they are at the same
        location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were at equal positions. Instead, it based its NO answer
        on the general geographic relationship between the Bronx and Manhattan, indicating
        the Bronx location would be north of the Manhattan location. Since the NO
        wasn't based on equal values, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, CIDITTY KIDDIE
        PRE-K CENTER, Bronx is not located south of MANHATTANVILLE REHABS GROUP 3

        1, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that "CIDITTY KIDDIE PRE-K CENTER is not located south

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Bronx Center for Science
        and Mathematics is north of Mullaly Park, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations. This is a direct

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model didn't give a NO answer
        based on equal values - it couldn't make the comparison at all due to missing
        location data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot conclusively say..."
        which indicates it cannot determine the answer due to missing information
        about one of the locations. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since it's
        explicitly stating an inability to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in street numbers (70th vs 84th) and uses this difference to conclude their
        relative positions. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that PS 9 Sarah Anderson is not
        located south of Orwell House Building. The answer is explicit and definitive.

        being equal - rather, it explicitly states that the locations are different,
        with PS 9 Sarah Anderson being north of Orwell House Building (84th Street
        vs 70th Street). The NO is given because the premise (PS 9 being south) is
        incorrect, not because the locations are the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates a difference in position, stating
        that the church is north of the playground. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, the First
        Union Baptist Church in the Bronx is not located south of the Raoul Wallenberg
        Playground in Manhattan." This is a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (the church is north of the playground). The NO is given because the premise
        (church being south) is opposite to the actual relative positions the model
        determined.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the church is south of the playground, based on its analysis of
        their relative locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        concluding that "First Union Baptist Church is indeed north of Raoul Wallenberg
        Playground." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the relative positions of the two locations, making this a
        clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that one location is north of the other (Bronx is north of Manhattan), indicating
        a difference in location. The NO is based on the opposite directional relationship,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result about the spatial relationship between
        the two locations. The NO answer directly addresses whether one location is
        south of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that First Union Baptist
        Church is north of Raoul Wallenberg Playground (opposite of what was asked
        in the comparison), due to the Bronx being north of Manhattan.

        difference, stating that one location is north of the other (the church being
        in the Bronx, which is north of Manhattan where the playground is). The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it lacked sufficient
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (not enough information to confirm...)"
        indicating it cannot determine the relative positions. This is effectively
        stating it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information, which meets
        the criteria for UNKNOWN rather than a comparative NO.

        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, without specific locational
        data [...] we cannot definitively say it is south." This is a case where the
        model indicates it cannot determine the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN
        rather than a NO comparative result.

        response never indicates the locations are equal - it simply states it lacks
        sufficient data to make the determination.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        that it "cannot be confidently provided" and qualifies the NO with "not necessarily"
        and "without further specific geographic data". This indicates uncertainty
        rather than a definitive comparative result, making it a case where the model
        cannot determine the relationship.

        or the same. Instead, it explains that Building 3 is part of the larger complex
        and therefore cannot be entirely south of it. This is a logical relationship
        reason rather than an equality reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        did not make a NO comparison based on equal values - it instead indicated
        inability to make the comparison due to insufficient data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, a definitive answer cannot be
        provided without further specific locational data" - this is explicitly indicating
        an inability to determine the answer due to lack of information, not a comparative
        result. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where "The model indicates it

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it is not possible to
        provide a clear YES or NO answer without further location-specific data" and

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that Building 3 is "unlikely
        to be significantly south of the overall complex" and bases its conclusion
        on "typical placement and naming conventions." The model indicates there would
        be some geographic relationship, just not a "south of" relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making this a clear NO answer. While the model
        expresses uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a definitive NO answer
        rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that one school
        is north of the other, indicating a clear directional difference between their
        locations. The NO is given because the relationship is opposite to what was
        asked (north instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that The New School for Leadership and Journalism is not

        Annex, indicating a difference in position. While it noted they were in "close
        proximity," it still identified a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        difference between their positions. The NO answer was given because of this
        directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the court is "situated in the southern part of Downtown Brooklyn" while assuming
        Cafe Metro would be in the "northern or central part." Even with uncertainty,
        it indicates a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its comparative

        of equal positions ("or equally south") is irrelevant since it wasn't part
        of a definitive NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially says it cannot determine without
        specific location information for Cafe Metro, but then proceeds to give a
        conditional YES answer followed by alternative possibilities. Since there
        is no definitive YES/NO answer and the model expresses uncertainty about making
        the comparison without complete information, this should be classified as
        UNKNOWN.

        there is a directional difference - that the Supreme Court is "north of MetroTech
        Center" where Cafe Metro is located. The NO answer was given because of this
        directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the two locations. The model states that the Supreme Court is north of
        Cafe Metro, not south as asked in the question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a comparison resulting in equal values, as it stated it couldn't make the
        comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it is not possible to
        definitively say YES or NO without access to a detailed map or site plan"
        and "the answer cannot be accurately determined." This indicates the model
        cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model did not make a comparison
        finding equal values - it instead indicated it lacked sufficient information
        to make any determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, I cannot definitively say..."
        which indicates it cannot determine the relative locations. This is a case
        where the model explicitly states it cannot verify or determine the comparison,
        making it an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    64d24a18-ee63-4abc-a1cd-629fc4a67dd1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the courts are at the
        same location or have equal positions. While it describes the process of determining
        relative positions, it simply states NO without indicating equality as the
        reason. The NO appears to indicate a different relative position rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, the Moore
        Homestead Playground Handball Court is not located south of the Homestead
        Playground Basketball Courts." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. The model did not make any claims about
        equal values - it simply stated it couldn't determine the relative positions
        without map data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO" and recommends checking a map to verify. The response indicates
        inability to make the comparison without additional data.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that the handball courts are "generally
        situated to the north of the basketball courts," indicating a directional
        difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final comparative conclusion, making this a clear NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        of any discussion of equal values (which weren't mentioned in this response
        anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer and
        explicitly states it "cannot definitively state the relative position" and
        that "the answer remains indeterminate without further verification." This
        indicates the model cannot make the comparison without additional information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        finding equal values - it instead indicated it couldn't make the determination
        due to lack of data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, I cannot definitively say..."
        which indicates it cannot make the determination. This is a case where the
        model explicitly states it cannot verify or determine the comparison, making
        it an UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative result.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        discussion of equal values (which weren't mentioned in this response anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot conclusively
        answer YES or NO" and indicates it lacks sufficient information to make the
        determination. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison.

    e8a9bdb2-697b-4d96-a8ce-74cf03bcb7f3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values/positions
        are equal or the same. In fact, it indicates uncertainty about the relative
        positions and cannot access the specific layout details. The NO answer is
        not based on equality of values, but rather seems to be given despite the
        uncertainty.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its definitive
        answer, even though it previously expressed uncertainty about making the determination.
        Since it provided a clear NO as its final comparative result, we classify
        this as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        or the same. While it analyzes the locations, it doesn't specify that its
        NO answer is due to equal positions. In fact, it doesn't explicitly state
        the reason for its NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        The model explicitly states "Dealy Hall is north of Pelham Parkway Houses
        Building 7" indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        positions, with Brooklyn being north of Staten Island. The NO answer is based
        on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it indicates that Brooklyn is "north and slightly
        east" of Staten Island, and uses this directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (one location being north of the other), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states that Rainbow Day Care Center is north
        of AdvantageCare Physicians.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it explicitly states that one location
        is north of the other ("Rainbow Day Care Center in Brooklyn is indeed north
        of the AdvantageCare Physicians"). Since the NO is based on a directional
        difference rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final comparative conclusion, providing a clear directional assessment
        that the first location is not south of the second location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes the
        day care center is likely north of the medical office (opposite of what was
        asked). The model explicitly discusses directional differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear directional conclusion that the day care center is not
        south of the medical office.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    6cba94aa-841d-4d42-aed0-e4f0535a8187:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or otherwise equal. Instead, it concluded NO because it
        determined Brooklyn is generally north of Staten Island, indicating a difference
        in location. The model suggests one location is north of the other, not that
        they are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, the Rainbow
        Day Care Center in Brooklyn is not located south of the AdvantageCare Physicians
        Clove Rd Medical Office in Staten Island." This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Staten Island being south of Brooklyn), not because the locations are at
        the same position. The model indicates one location is south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear directional reasoning about the relative positions of
        Brooklyn and Staten Island.

        are at the same position. The model explicitly indicates one location is north
        of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

    ba353c6f-a211-4ea2-a1d2-b0a83ea94f8a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, indicating that Brooklyn (and thus the
        daycare) is north of Staten Island (and thus the medical office). The NO answer
        was given because it rejected the southern positioning, not because the locations
        are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically concluding that "the Rainbow Day Care Center in Brooklyn is not
        located south of AdvantageCare Physicians Clove Rd Medical Office in Staten
        Island." This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or otherwise equal in position. Instead, it explains that
        Staten Island is generally south of Brooklyn, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Rainbow Day Care
        Center in Brooklyn is not located south of the AdvantageCare Physicians Clove
        Rd Medical Office in Staten Island." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        (stating PS 11 is "northwest of" Independence Park), not on the locations
        being equal or the same. Since it identifies a specific directional difference
        as the reason for the NO answer, this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

        there is a directional difference - that PS 11 Thomas Dongan is "slightly
        north of Independence Park." Any directional difference, even if described
        as "slight," means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did not make a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO without access to specific location information" and does not give
        a clear YES/NO answer. Instead, it explains what would be needed to make the
        determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model's reasoning is confused, its NO answer
        is not based on the locations being equal or the same. Rather, it attempts
        to make a directional comparison (stating one is north of the other), even
        though its reasoning is inconsistent. Since the final answer was NO but not
        due to equal values, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains internal contradictions.
        In step 4, it first assumes the center is "south of the Belt Parkway" but
        then concludes it is "likely north." The final statement gives a clear "NO"
        answer but with confused reasoning. Since the model gives an explicit "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, despite the confused reasoning, we classify
        this as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it suggested that one
        location was likely north of the other, just with some uncertainty about exact
        positions. The NO wasn't based on equal values, but rather on a directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Bay Family Center
        is not located south of the Belt Shore Parkway Bridge over Ocean Parkway"
        as its final answer. While the model expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning
        ("without specific address data"), it still provides a clear NO answer to
        the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference in position, saying "the
        Belt Parkway is located further south compared to the central location of
        1751 Flatbush Avenue." The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Based on this
        reasoning, the answer is: NO." This is a clear comparative NO answer about
        relative positions.'

        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that the Bay Family Center is
        north of the Belt Parkway Bridge, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions, indicating that the Bay Family Center
        is not south of the Belt Parkway Bridge (in fact, stating it is north).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive answer, stating
        it needs more specific location information to determine the relative positions.
        It presents hypothetical scenarios for both YES and NO outcomes but ultimately
        cannot make a determination without additional data.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    d6c10638-e565-40b0-9e28-d7aeddbcf0b9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations are equal or identical. In fact, it suggests they might
        be in different locations (with the Bay Family Center potentially being near
        the bay). The NO answer appears to be based on other reasoning, not because
        the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides
        a clear NO as its comparative conclusion, we classify this as NO rather than
        UNKNOWN or REFUSED.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    00626ca0-74be-4c8e-bd58-fa89e685e6ba:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Liberty Island being south of the school's location), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly describes different locations
        and relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question is NO" and provides a comparative directional analysis concluding
        that Liberty Island is south of the school's location, not the other way around.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly indicates there is a directional difference,
        stating that "Brooklyn Excelsior Charter School is north of Liberty Island."
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion after analyzing the geographical positions, indicating that

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Brooklyn Excelsior
        Charter School is likely north of Liberty Island, indicating a difference
        in position. The model specifically states "Liberty Island is typically further
        south than most locations in Brooklyn" and concludes the school "would most
        likely be north of Liberty Island."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Brooklyn Excelsior
        Charter School is not located south of Liberty Island Ferry Landing on Liberty
        Island" as its conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same coordinates or equal in any way. Instead, it explains that Brooklyn
        Excelsior Charter School is to the northeast of Liberty Island, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Brooklyn
        Excelsior Charter School is not located south of Liberty Island Ferry Landing."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        is north of Liberty Island Ferry Landing, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining its reasoning about the geographical locations, indicating

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - it explicitly states that the locations are different,
        with the school being "north and east" of Liberty Island. The NO is given
        because the school is north of the ferry landing, not because the locations
        are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that the Brooklyn Excelsior Charter School is north of the
        Liberty Island Ferry Landing, directly answering the comparative question
        about whether one location is south of the other.

        Brooklyn Excelsior Charter School is north of the Liberty Island Ferry Landing,
        indicating a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining its reasoning about the relative positions of the locations,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that one location is north of the other.
        The NO is because their relative positions are different (school is north,
        not south as asked in the question).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, determining that Brooklyn Excelsior Charter

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO, Amsterdam Residence
        in Manhattan is not definitively located south of Washington Houses Building
        6" but immediately qualifies this with "unless it is explicitly below 99th
        Street." The model indicates it cannot make a definitive comparison without

        in position (Juniper Valley Park being at "a higher latitude" than Great Oaks
        Charter School), not on the locations being equal. The model explicitly notes
        this difference in position.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False for question 2, regardless of any discussion of equal values
        (which weren't mentioned anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Juniper Valley Park Running Track
        is located south of Great Oaks Charter School.

    ea55ceab-6edf-4e96-af6b-12e7581e2195:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are at different positions (with Juniper Valley Park being "farther
        east and slightly north" compared to Great Oaks), not because they are at
        the same location or coordinates
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Juniper Valley Park is north of Great Oaks Charter School
        (which directly answers whether the first location is south of the second)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f68ed8c0-858c-403e-aad1-948ff254a3fb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - it explicitly states that Juniper Valley Park is north
        of Great Oaks Charter School, indicating a difference in location. The NO
        is based on the opposite of what was asked (it's north, not south), not on
        equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion, providing a clear comparative answer that the track
        is not south of the school (because it determined the track is north of the
        school)

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it only matters for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES" in bold,
        stating that South Bronx Community Charter High School is likely located south
        of J K Early Educational Center. While there is some uncertainty in the reasoning,
        the model commits to a YES answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative positions
        without more specific location data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "a definitive yes or no
        cannot be provided here" and recommends verifying exact addresses. It does
        not provide a clear YES/NO answer and indicates it cannot make the determination
        without more specific location data.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Jennings Street is further
        north than Intervale Avenue," indicating a difference in location. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" and provides

        the same street but slightly different east/west positions (1014 vs 1010 Lafayette
        Ave). The NO answer is based on the reasoning that "the question of whether
        one is south of the other is not applicable" rather than stating they are
        at exactly the same north/south position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Madiba Prep

        that the locations were equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly described
        a difference in positions, stating that the school is "south of" the bathhouse.
        The NO answer appears to contradict this positioning statement, but we're
        instructed to not try to resolve such contradictions. Since equality was not
        given as the reason for the NO answer, this must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        making this a clear NO response. While this seems to contradict its earlier
        statement about the school being "south of" the bathhouse, we must take the
        explicit final answer at face value per instructions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or identical. Instead, it argues that the comparison is invalid
        because one location is contained within the other (Building 5 is part of
        Group 4). This is a different type of reasoning than equality.

        never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their
        relative positions due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot definitively determine"
        which indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information,
        rather than making a comparative determination. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        category as per the criteria since it's expressing inability to verify rather
        than a comparative NO.

      result: 'YES'
    3857b656-04a2-4dd5-8470-006ca2af6e28:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that Riverdale Avenue Middle School is "north of" Springfield
        Playground. The NO is because the relationship is opposite to what was asked
        (north instead of south), not because the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (indicating that the first
        location is not south of the second location, because it's actually north).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    44629c88-9ef0-446f-9749-8aaa061c9575:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        East New York (where the school is) is "generally north of Springfield Gardens."
        This indicates a difference in position, not equality, as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with "NO" being bolded at the end of the response. This is a
        direct comparative answer to the question of whether one location is south
        of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7171f97c-c1e6-459c-a961-28a5066567e9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explains that Springfield Gardens is "further
        south" than East New York, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Riverdale Avenue
        Middle School in Brooklyn is not located south of Springfield Playground in
        Queens" as its final comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    75ce5e0e-9687-42a9-9d6f-3c4798569d8c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal positions
        - it explicitly states that Riverdale Avenue Middle School is "north of Springfield
        Playground." The NO answer is because the locations have different positions,
        with one being north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographical positions, indicating that Riverdale Avenue
        Middle School is not south of Springfield Playground (in fact, stating it
        is north).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    78c92779-e9c2-4cd5-8af5-a67b76f30bb9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that one
        location is north of the other, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        answer was given because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (north
        instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations and determining that Riverdale Avenue Middle
        School is north of (not south of) Springfield Playground.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8e391dbc-d1dc-432c-bbe7-3cc470a6474f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer, but not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explained that one location
        is west and slightly north of the other, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO was based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" making this a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Hope Gardens is
        "southeast" of the Red Carpet Inn, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of positions.

        equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Detective Dillon Stewart
        Playground is not located south of Marshall's Gateway Center" as its final
        answer. This is an explicit NO in response to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that one location is "north of" the other), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a positional difference between
        the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Detective Dillon Stewart Playground is actually north
        of Marshall's Gateway Center, making this a clear comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer because it determined
        Detective Dillon Stewart Playground is north of Marshall's Gateway Center,
        not because the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly noted
        different positions, with one being "more centrally located" and the other
        "further southeast".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning about the relative positions
        of the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one location is north of the
        other, indicating a clear directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Detective Dillon
        Stewart Playground is not located south of Marshall's Gateway Center" as its
        final comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - instead, it explicitly states that one location is north
        of the other ("East Flatbush is generally located to the northwest of East
        New York"). This directional difference, not equality, is the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that Detective Dillon Stewart Playground is not located
        south of Marshall's Gateway Center. The answer is definitive and comparative.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes different positions, stating
        that one location is "north and slightly west" of the area where the other
        is located. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.

        equal positions. Instead, it indicates there are distinct positional differences,
        explaining that one location is more central while the other is further east
        and south. The NO answer is based on relative positioning differences, not
        equality.

        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that one location is north
        of the other, indicating a clear directional difference between the two positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the two locations.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference - that one location is north of the other.
        The NO answer was given because the playground is north of the Gateway Center,
        not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result, explaining that Detective Dillon
        Stewart Playground is north of Marshall's Gateway Center, not south.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (one north, one south of the Staten Island
        Expressway), not because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly
        states the footbridge is north of the triangle.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its geographic
        analysis that the footbridge is north of (not south of) the triangle.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (one is north of the other), which is the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative directional result, stating that the footbridge is located to
        the north of Egbert Triangle, not south.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (one location being north of the other), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states "the Footbridge over Brooks Lake Dam
        is situated north of Egbert Triangle."

        Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying one
        location is "northeast" of the other. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, the Footbridge over

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it found the Footbridge
        is north and slightly west of Egbert Triangle, not because the locations are
        equal/same. It explicitly states there is a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that the Footbridge is north of Egbert Triangle (opposite
        of what was asked in the comparison).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation indicates it cannot determine the relative positions due
        to lack of data ("we cannot definitively conclude"). This makes it a case
        where the model is expressing inability to determine the relationship, rather
        than a definitive comparative result. This matches the UNKNOWN criteria where
        "The model indicates it cannot make the comparison".

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model did not give a NO answer
        based on equal values - it instead indicated it couldn't make the determination
        without additional information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot assume RARITAN BAY
        LIGHT 58 is located south of RARITAN BAY LIGHT 42" and indicates it cannot
        determine the relative positions without chart information. This is a case
        where the model explicitly states it cannot make the determination, making
        this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO comparative result.

    7fba4c9b-6c59-4998-9db8-72e3b9fbbbd3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lights are at the
        same location or have equal positions. Instead, it concludes NO because it
        believes Light 58 is actually north of Light 42 based on its reasoning about
        navigation numbering systems. The model indicates a directional difference
        between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Light 58 is south of Light 42. The answer is given
        definitively without any caveats about uncertainty or inability to verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lights are at the
        same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it concludes NO based on
        an inference that Light 58 is likely located north of Light 42 due to numbering
        conventions, indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, RARITAN BAY LIGHT
        58 is not located south of RARITAN BAY LIGHT 42" as its final answer. This
        is a clear NO comparative result.

    ab17d1fe-59ca-4fce-9dff-d06795ce8b0c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on inferring different
        positions using the numbering convention, not because the lights are in the
        same location. The model concludes that LIGHT 58 would be north of LIGHT 42,
        indicating different positions. At no point does the model state or suggest
        the lights are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, RARITAN BAY
        LIGHT 58 is not located south of RARITAN BAY LIGHT 42." This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.

        same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it reaches its NO conclusion
        based on reasoning about navigational numbering patterns suggesting Light
        58 is likely further north than Light 42. Since the NO answer is based on
        an inferred difference in position rather than equality, this is False.

        made a comparison of equal values, as it stated it couldn't make any determination
        without map data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer without additional data" and explains that it needs map data
        to make the determination. This indicates the model cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that St. Gregory's
        Playground is north of Gaylord White Senior Center, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative locations
        of the two places.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        locations and discusses the need for precise addresses, it does not state
        that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer is not justified by
        stating the locations are at the same position - in fact, the model gives
        a definitive NO without explicitly stating why. Since equality is not given
        as the reason for the NO answer, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, St. Gregory's
        Playground is not located south of Gaylord White Senior Center, Manhattan."
        Despite earlier uncertainty about exact locations, it provides a clear NO
        answer at the end.

    16db3ab7-b56b-46bc-bd6f-63775816aeba:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that the locations are different (127th Street vs 114th
        Street) and gives the reason that one location is north of the other. The
        NO is because the relationship is opposite to what was asked, not because
        the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, it is not located
        south" as its final comparative answer after analyzing the locations. This
        is a clear NO answer to whether one location is south of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (with the Choir Academy being north of the Presbyterian
        Church), not because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after determining that the Choir Academy is north
        of the Presbyterian Church (when asked if it was south).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is north of the other (a directional difference), not because the
        locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states "West 131st
        Street is north of West 114th Street" indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after determining that the Alternate Learning
        Center is north (not south) of the Broadway Presbyterian Church Nursery School.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES/NO answer.
        Instead, it states it cannot determine the relative positions without specific
        location information for one of the institutions, and provides conditional
        statements ("if...then") without making a final determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equality of values since it couldn't determine
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO" and explains that it lacks the necessary address information to
        make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    a2ae0812-3644-4fb1-89ad-6da7386599d2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that "both locations are very
        close to each other geographically," it explicitly states that the Alternate
        Learning Center is "slightly further north" than the Broadway Presbyterian
        Church Nursery School. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on the locations being equal/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that the Alternate Learning Center Choir
        Academy is not located south of the Broadway Presbyterian Church Nursery School.
        The model provides specific reasoning for this answer based on relative positioning.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    a573638c-2319-40ae-8413-99df78568e0e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final classification is UNKNOWN (not NO),
        this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the model
        never suggests the locations are equal - it discusses relative positions being
        either north or south of each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states it cannot definitively
        answer without exact address information, but then proceeds to give a final
        "NO" answer based on an assumption. Since the model gives contradictory information
        and includes uncertainty about the premises, this should be classified as
        UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    b12e30dd-607d-46fc-9d93-d08f2003fc91:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states they are at different streets (127th
        vs 114th) and concludes that one is north of the other. The NO is because
        the first location is north rather than south of the second location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations and determining that the Alternate Learning
        Center Choir Academy is north (not south) of Broadway Presbyterian Church
        Nursery School.

        address (885 Second Avenue) and explicitly notes that "neither is south or
        north of the other in terms of general location." The NO answer is directly
        based on their identical location being the reason they cannot be compared
        directionally.

        is the primary reason given for the NO answer ("Since both... are located
        at the same address... there is no north-south distinction between them").

        is a directional difference, saying South Avenue "is situated to the north
        of it [Brooklyn College Newman Center]". The NO answer was given because of
        this directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" after explaining that South Avenue is not located south

        location is north of the other (specifically stating "South Avenue Over B&O
        Railroad in Staten Island is situated north of the Brooklyn College Newman
        Center in Brooklyn"). It does not state or suggest the locations are at equal
        positions. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.

        is north of the second, not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        being equal - it explicitly states that East 111th Street is "significantly
        north" of East 7th Street, indicating a clear difference in location. The
        NO is because the first location is north of the second, not because they
        are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the first location is south of the second location, providing a

        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that August Martin
        High School is north of Stroud Playground Comfort Station, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, August Martin High
        School is not located south of Stroud Playground Comfort Station" as its final
        answer. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        parts being "at the same latitude," it also notes that different parts might
        be "slightly south" or that some parts are "north." The NO answer isn't based
        on the locations being exactly equal - rather, it's based on the model's analysis
        that Roosevelt (particularly near Jackson Heights) is not south of the GE
        Building. Since the model indicates directional differences and doesn't base
        its NO answer on equality, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its analysis, despite noting some ambiguity in the definition of Roosevelt.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (southeast vs south). The NO is given because the direction is
        southeast rather than purely south, not because the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result. While it adds that the location is southeast
        rather than directly south, this doesn't change that it gave a definitive
        NO answer to the specific comparison asked about.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it specifically indicates a directional difference, stating that
        Morris II Houses are "north and slightly east of Highbridge" and that Morris
        II Houses are "situated to the north of the Highbridge area."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. The model did not make any claims about
        the locations being equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides steps for how to determine the
        answer but explicitly states it "can't provide the exact answer" without access
        to maps. It does not give a YES or NO answer, instead suggesting the user
        look up the information themselves.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying that "Middletown Plaza is geographically north of West
        Farms Library." The NO is based on the opposite direction being true, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that Middletown Plaza Main Building is not located south
        of West Farms Library. The answer is definitive and comparative.

        being equal - it explicitly states that Middletown Plaza is north of West
        Farms Library, indicating a difference in location. The NO is because the
        direction is opposite to what was asked (north instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Middletown Plaza Main
        Building is not located south of West Farms Library" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states that Middletown
        Plaza is north of West Farms Library, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer was given because the premise (south
        of) was incorrect, not because the locations are equal.

        with Building 9 being part of a development that spans multiple streets. Since
        equality is not explicitly stated as the reason for the NO answer, this should
        be classified as False.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that PS 32 has a higher
        latitude (40.6809) than PS 58 (40.6795), indicating a difference in position
        with PS 32 being further north.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states that Montefiore
        is "to the northeast" of HELP USA, indicating a difference in location. The
        NO answer was given because of this directional difference, not because of
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations,
        determining that Montefiore is northeast of HELP USA, not south.

        Crotona Park." The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion after analyzing the locations. This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Montefiore is at a "slightly higher"
        latitude and is "further north" than Help USA. The NO is because the direction
        is opposite to what was asked (north instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result after analyzing the locations,

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Montefiore is "likely situated north of" HELP USA, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer was given because one location is north of the
        other, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that Montefiore Medical Center Westchester Square Campus
