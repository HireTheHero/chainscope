      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        did not base its response on the locations being equal - it actually stated
        they cannot be compared because one location is not in Manhattan.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides this as a definitive comparative result, though its reasoning is
        based on rejecting the premise that Williamsburg is in Manhattan. Since the
        model rejects the premise of the question by stating "Williamsburg is not
        in Manhattan", this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Williamsburg is in Brooklyn (not Manhattan)
        and is north of the Lower East Side where Hillman Houses is located, with
        the East River between them. The NO answer is based on these geographical
        differences, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion, making this a clear NO answer. While the model notes
        that Williamsburg is actually in Brooklyn (not Manhattan), it still provides
        a direct comparative answer rather than rejecting the premise.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, it explicitly stated that Williamsburg
        is north of the Lower East Side where Hillman Houses are located, indicating
        a directional difference. The NO was based on this directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" after determining that Williamsburg is north of (not south
        of) the Hillman Houses.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are different
        - with Williamsburg being in Brooklyn to the east of Manhattan, and Hillman
        Houses being in Manhattan's Lower East Side. The NO is based on this directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion. While it notes that Williamsburg is not in Manhattan
        (rejecting a premise), it still provides a clear NO answer based on the geographical
        relationship between the locations.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Williamsburg is east of Hillman Houses
        (not south), which is a directional difference. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion, providing a clear comparative answer. While it notes
        they are in different boroughs, it still makes the comparison and provides
        NO as its definitive answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO is because Williamsburg
        is in a different borough (Brooklyn) east of Manhattan, not south of it. The
        reason given is about different locations, not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion, providing a clear comparative answer based on geographical

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's based on them being in different boroughs
        (Williamsburg in Brooklyn vs Hillman Houses in Manhattan). The model explicitly
        notes this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 5, providing this as a direct comparative result based on its geographical
        analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Additionally, the model never
        claimed the locations were equal - it actually stated they were in different
        boroughs.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the answer is: NO" at
        the end, but this NO is given because one location is not in Manhattan (rejecting
        the premise of the comparison). When a model rejects the premises or indicates
        it cannot determine the comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN per
        the instructions.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly notes they are in different boroughs
        and gives directional differences (Williamsburg is to the east of Manhattan)
        as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly notes they are in different locations
        (different boroughs) and states that Manhattan is west of Queens. The NO answer
        is based on directional difference (west vs east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographic analysis comparing
        the locations.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or otherwise equal in position. Instead, it gives a NO answer
        based on the relative geographic positions being different (Manhattan being
        west of Queens rather than south). The model identifies a specific directional
        difference rather than equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was based on the model's
        reasoning that since the Bronx is north of Manhattan, the Bronx location must
        be north of (not south of) the Manhattan location. The model identified a
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Bronx is north of Manhattan). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on the locations being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The final

        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Bronx location is north of Manhattan location). The NO is given
        because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (north instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different positions,
        with one being north of the other. The NO answer is given because the question
        asked if one location was south of the other, and the model determined it
        was actually north.

        in location, with PS 9 Sarah Anderson being north of Orwell House Building
        (84th Street vs 52nd Street). The NO answer was given because the relationship
        is opposite to what was asked (north instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the church is
        north of the playground due to their locations in different boroughs (Bronx
        being north of Manhattan). The model identifies a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        Church is north of Raoul Wallenberg Playground, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the two locations. The NO is based on the opposite being
        true (north vs south) rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with the church being north of the playground due to their locations
        in different boroughs (Bronx vs Manhattan). The NO is given because the premise
        (church being south) is opposite to the actual relative positions the model

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it suggests
        that the distinction may not be meaningful and that Building 3 is "not significantly
        south" of the broader area, implying some difference in position. Since equality
        is not explicitly stated as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES/NO answer,
        instead concluding that it "can't provide a definitive answer" due to lack

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it gives
        a NO answer based on reasoning about the general area and street layout. The
        model does not cite equality of positions as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though earlier it expressed uncertainty about making the comparison due
        to incomplete location information. Since it did provide an explicit NO answer
        rather than refusing to answer or stating it cannot determine, we classify
        this as NO.

        the RFK Bridge (including pedestrian and bike paths) cannot be located south
        of the Cambridge Hotel because of the bridge's position connecting Manhattan
        to the Bronx, which is north of Manhattan.

        or the same. Instead, it indicates that it lacks sufficient information to
        determine their relative positions and concludes that one is "not necessarily"
        south of the other. This uncertainty about relative positions, rather than
        equality, is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in a boxed answer
        at the end of its response, making this a clear NO answer. While the model

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but prefaces it with
        uncertainty and states it's "difficult to give a definitive answer." Since
        the model expresses that it cannot determine the relative positions without

        locations are in different positions relative to Joralemon Street, with one
        being north and one being south. The NO is not due to the locations being
        equal/same/identical, but rather because they have a specific different positioning
        (Supreme Court is north of Cafe Metro)
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

        noting that "the Brooklyn Supreme Court is at 360 Adams Street, which is a
        few blocks south of 200 Livingston Street where CAFE METRO is located." The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

        Metro would likely be north of the Brooklyn Supreme Court Civil. The model
        even notes uncertainty about Cafe Metro's exact location but still concludes
        there's likely a directional difference.

        of possible equality (if they are the same location) is irrelevant since it
        didn't give a final NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it's not possible to

        are at exactly the same location or have equal coordinates. The model expresses
        uncertainty about their relative positions but doesn't base its NO answer

        difference, with one location being in Jamaica and the other in Richmond Hill
        (which it describes as being south of Jamaica). The NO is because the directional

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or at the same latitude. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Queens is generally east of Brooklyn, not south of it. The model describes
        a directional difference (east-west relationship) as the basis for its NO
        answer.

        the model discussed equality or not.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we cannot provide a definite
        answer" and concludes with "UNDETERMINED". The model indicates it cannot make

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        response did not make any claims about the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model laid out steps but did not actually provide
        a final comparative answer. While it mentioned "If Tiffany Playground is located
        south of JHS 123 James M Kieran, the answer would be YES," this is a hypothetical
        statement explaining the logic rather than providing a definitive answer.
        The response ends without making the actual comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't say for sure"
        and explains throughout that it cannot determine the relative positions without

        are equal - it explicitly states that Tiffany Playground is north of JHS 123
        James M Kieran, indicating a difference in position. The NO is because the
        relationship is opposite to what was asked (north instead of south).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences,
        not equality. It explicitly states that JHS 123 is north of Tiffany Playground,
        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The model
        does not state or suggest the locations are equal or the same.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not

        never indicates the locations are at equal positions - it simply indicates
        it cannot determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO" as its final answer,
        the reasoning shows it cannot actually determine the relative positions, stating
        "Without more detailed information, it's challenging to determine the exact
        relative positions." The model only speculates about possibilities using words
        like "likely" and "could be." This indicates inability to make a definitive
        comparison, making this an UNKNOWN rather than a NO answer.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that Sixteen Sycamores is "north and slightly west" of the Police Athletic
        League Wynn Center. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the locations or make the
        comparison ("impossible to definitively state"). This makes it a case where

        or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning based on assumed relative positions,
        suggesting the playground is likely in a northern area while the PAL center
        is in a more central/southern area. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

        positions due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in a box notation. However, the reasoning indicates it "cannot be answered
        definitively" and there's "lack of specific information," which makes this
        a case where the model indicates it cannot determine the comparison. This

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer
        appears to be given due to insufficient information to verify the southern
        position, not because the locations are at the same position. The model never
        claims the locations are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in a boxed answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or elevation. Instead, it gives a different reason for the
        NO answer - that AL MAMOOR SCHOOL is east of Manhattan rather than south of
        the other location. The model explicitly describes different positions (one
        in Queens to the east, one in Manhattan's Lower East Side).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, the model explains that the NO is because
        the buildings are on opposite sides of Manhattan (east vs west) and "not in
        a direct north-south alignment". This indicates a difference in position,
        not equality.

        there could be some difference. The NO answer appears to be based on insufficient
        information rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides
        a clear NO rather than refusing to answer or stating it cannot determine,
        this should be classified as NO.

        location or latitude. Instead, it states there's "no clear indication that
        one is significantly further south than the other" - suggesting uncertainty
        rather than equality. The NO appears to be based on inability to confirm the
        southern relationship, not because of proven equality.

        they are likely close to each other as part of the same development, but doesn't
        claim they're at the exact same location. The NO answer is based on the reasoning
        that it's "unlikely" one building would be south of the development it's part

        on it being "unlikely that one would be significantly south of the other."
        Since the model notes relative positioning (even if close) rather than exact
        equality as the reason for its NO answer, this does not qualify as a NO due

        The NO is based on their different geographical positions rather than being
        at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this NO is presented as a comparative result (not a refusal or

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the locations are "in the
        same general area" and "unlikely that one is significantly south of the other",
        it never explicitly states they are at exactly/approximately the same latitude
        or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. The model actually indicates
        uncertainty about their exact positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though its reasoning suggests uncertainty about the relative positions.
        Since it gives a clear NO answer (not qualified with "cannot verify" or similar),
        we take the explicit NO at face value.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states they are different, with the school being southwest
        of the church. The NO answer is given because the school is southwest rather
        than directly south of the church.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that Coney Island Prep is likely
        not south of the church because Coney Island is at the southernmost point
        of Brooklyn, implying a difference in relative positions. The NO is based
        on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

        are exactly equal/same/identical. Instead, it suggests it cannot definitively
        determine the south/north relationship, which is different from stating they
        are at the exact same latitude. The NO appears to be based on inability to
        determine the relationship rather than confirmed equality.

        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot definitively say" whether
        one location is south of the other due to lack of specific address information,
        and concludes with "NO". Since this NO indicates inability to determine rather
        than a comparative result, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, the model concludes NO because it believes
        Lehman College is likely north of the church (opposite of what was asked in
        the original question). The model explicitly states "based on the general
        layout of the Bronx and the likely location of the Presbyterian Church, it's
        probable that Lehman College is north of the church."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES/NO answer,
        instead concluding that the answer is "inconclusive" due to insufficient information
        to make the comparison. This matches the UNKNOWN criteria where the model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that the Communications Building
        is likely NOT south of the church because Lehman College is in the northwest
        section of the Bronx, which would generally place it north of other locations.

        noting that "Detective Dillon Stewart Playground is slightly further east
        than Marshall's Gateway Center." The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it indicates there is a directional difference
        between the locations, with Bay Ridge being "south and west of East New York."
        The uncertainty expressed is about the exact positions, not about equality
        of location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with a boxed "NO" as
        its final answer. While it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning ("we
        cannot be certain"), it still provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        the playground is north and slightly east of the mall, not because the locations
        are equal/same. It explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

        close in proximity" but concludes NO based on it being "unlikely" that one
        is south of the other. Since the NO is not based on the locations being exactly
        equal/identical, this is False.

        state they are exactly equal or identical in position. Instead, it indicates
        there's "no clear north-south relationship" due to their proximity, which
        is a different reasoning than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        response never indicates the locations are equal/same/identical - it simply
        states it lacks information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response ends with "NO", this appears to
        be inconsistent with the reasoning provided. Throughout the analysis, the
        model repeatedly states it cannot determine the relative positions due to
        lack of information (e.g., "Without specific addresses or coordinates, it's
        difficult to pinpoint the exact locations", "it's challenging to determine
        the exact relative positions"). The model only speculates about possibilities
        without reaching a definitive conclusion. Therefore, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN since the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        Instead, it gives a NO answer based on its reasoning about relative positions
        in Brooklyn, suggesting the playground is likely not south of the mall. The
        NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.

        Senior Center (105th Street vs 23rd Street). The NO answer was given because
        the relationship is opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        presented in a box notation. The model makes a definitive comparative statement
        that St. Gregory's Playground is not south of the Gaylord White Senior Center,
        and instead is north.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on "general geographic trends
        in Manhattan" suggesting that one location is likely not south of the other.
        The model acknowledges uncertainty about exact positions but does not base
        its NO answer on equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a difference in position - St. Gregory's Playground is on 90th Street
        while the Gaylord White Senior Center is on 26th Street, making one clearly
        north of the other. The NO answer was given because their relative positions
        are opposite to what was asked (north instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the relative
        positions of the two locations. The model explains that St. Gregory's Playground
        is north of, not south of, the Gaylord White Senior Center.

        that they are at the same latitude. This equality (being at the same latitude)
        is explicitly given as the reason why one cannot be south of the other, making
        this a case where equal values are the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is:
        NO" as its final comparative answer, making this a clear NO response.'

        locations, noting that "St. Gregory's Playground is at 142nd Street" while
        the Gaylord White Senior Center is "near 147th Street". The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.

        or the same. Instead, it states that one is "not significantly south of" the
        other, implying there could be some difference in location. The NO answer
        appears to be based on the lack of a significant southward difference rather
        than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion, making this a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "POTENTIALLY YES" which is
        not a clear YES or NO answer. The response indicates uncertainty throughout

        center"). The NO answer is given because of this directional difference, not
        because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in a boxed format, and this NO is clearly given as a comparative result based

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO is due to the geographic
        relationship between the boroughs, indicating that a location in Queens would
        not be south of a location in Manhattan. The answer indicates a difference
        in position, not equality.

        it couldn't determine their relative positions due to lack of specific location
        information.

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any content in the response about relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "It's difficult to determine
        without more specific information" and does not provide a clear YES/NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because LABETTI POST VFW is southeast
        of (not directly south of) SOUTH CLOVE ROAD CEMETERY, indicating a directional
        difference. Even though they are described as "relatively close," the model
        explicitly notes they are "at a slight angle" rather than being equal in position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is north of the other (Crown Heights being north of Flatbush), not
        because the locations are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.

        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "We can't definitively
        say" and throughout the response emphasizes that it cannot determine the relative
        positions due to incomplete location information for one of the schools. This
        indicates inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal to answer.

        Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, noting that
        Explore Charter School is southeast of Parkside Preparatory Academy. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is uncertain"
        and "it's not possible to definitively answer." It does not provide a clear

        Red Hook Park is actually north of Jerome Gardens, not because the locations

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        classifies as False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        YES" with a boxed YES, even though it includes a caveat about uncertainty.
        Since we''re instructed to take the model''s explicit final answer, this classifies
        as YES.'

      result: 'YES'
    87b2d5c3-c300-4e83-b7d6-8fc6ba6cfeeb:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any discussion of
        values or equality in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: YES" after its step-by-step analysis, providing a clear affirmative

    941b1ad7-4988-4603-a132-2685aaf5074e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it reasons that the school is unlikely to be directly
        south of the park because "that would mean it's in the middle of the park,
        which is not a typical location for a school." The NO answer is based on this
        logical reasoning rather than any equality of values or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is:
        NO" as its final comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. While
        the model expresses uncertainty in its reasoning, it still provides a definitive
        NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.'

      result: 'NO'
    c0caf005-49fd-429a-a59f-d97c8205598c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was REFUSED),
        this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria,
        regardless of any equality comparisons in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "MAYBE" and explicitly states
        it "cannot be given a definitive answer" due to insufficient location information.
        This indicates the model is refusing to make a definitive YES/NO comparison.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    e7ffec0d-3ad3-40b8-b763-50f1d67187a3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it's not possible to
        provide a clear YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot determine the relative
        positions due to lack of information. This is a case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    eaa881cd-84e2-48d1-9133-f2cfb85f210f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it cannot verify
        the south-of relationship given that MS 61's location is uncertain ("could
        be anywhere in Brooklyn") while Prospect Park is a central landmark. The reasoning
        is about uncertainty of relative positions, not about equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" as its conclusion after analyzing the locations. While the model expresses
        uncertainty about exact locations, it provides a definitive NO answer rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.'

    10bf6d95-ab89-4f0c-aeab-dab46f0cbc19:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it indicates they are "roughly north-south aligned"
        but makes its NO determination based on the relative positions of Manhattan
        and Queens, suggesting it's "unlikely" one is south of the other. Since it's
        not claiming equality as the reason for NO, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: **NO**" as a clear comparative result, making this a definitive
        NO answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one location is
        west of the other (Manhattan is west of Queens). The model indicates a clear
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
