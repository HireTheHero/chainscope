      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the values were equal - it rejected the premise entirely.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question since
        Williamsburg is in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. While it eventually says "NO"
        when forced, this NO is due to rejecting the premise rather than making a
        comparative judgment. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where "the model
        rejects the premises of the question."
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    2986c0c3-6b55-428b-a7e3-cafbead6a708:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of the reasoning given in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and concludes with "CANNOT BE DETERMINED" because one of the
        locations in the comparison doesn't exist. This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        as the model rejects the premises of the question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        also did not make any equality comparison between values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question by stating
        that Williamsburg is not in Manhattan, making the comparison impossible. While
        it ends with "NO", it explicitly states this is due to an incorrect premise
        and that it "cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer." This falls under
        the UNKNOWN criteria where the model rejects the premises of the question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        the values were equal - it instead stated that the comparison was impossible
        due to an incorrect premise.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but does so while rejecting the premise of the question (stating that Williamsburg
        is in Brooklyn, not Manhattan, making the comparison impossible). This makes
        it a case where the model rejects the premises of the question, which should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model did not cite equality of
        values as a reason - it stated the comparison was impossible because one location
        wasn't in Manhattan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but rejects the premise of the question because Williamsburg is not in Manhattan.
        When a model rejects the premises or indicates it cannot make the comparison,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question because
        one location doesn't exist as specified (Williamsburg, Manhattan). The model
        explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or NO answer" and explains that the
        question is "geographically nonsensical." This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria

      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question by stating
        "Williamsburg is not in Manhattan" and declares the question "invalid." While
        it says "NO," this NO is immediately qualified as being due to the invalid
        premise rather than a comparative result. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria
        where "the model rejects the premises of the question."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly gives a directional reason
        - that Manhattan is west of Queens and a location in Manhattan would not typically
        be south of a location in Queens. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

    9029dec5-cf8a-4bed-90d3-4c1385ef920b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Manhattan being north of Queens), not because the locations are at the same
        coordinates. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final

    9c6eea18-a985-460a-b98e-f3b5ccc79802:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states the reason is that
        Manhattan is north of Queens, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO." This is a clear, direct NO answer to the comparative question.'

    a9ab9fc5-a1d8-4ebe-911e-4f0760913285:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Manhattan being north of Queens), not because the locations are at the same
        latitude. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference, with
        Manhattan being "north of Queens geographically."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, based on its geographical analysis determining that Manhattan

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - rather, it explicitly states that one location is north of the
        other (Bronx is north of Manhattan). The NO answer is given because one location
        is definitively in a different position than what was asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on the geographic locations of
        the two places.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the directional
        difference it identifies (Bronx being north of Manhattan), not because the
        locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a
        directional difference between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative positions
        (Bronx being north of Manhattan), not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly notes a difference in position, stating one
        location cannot be south of the other because it's actually north.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Bronx is north of Manhattan). The NO is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (Bronx is north
        of Manhattan, therefore not south)

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the relative positions
        of the Bronx and Manhattan (Bronx being north of Manhattan), not because the
        locations are at the same coordinates. The model explicitly indicates there
        is a directional difference between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't verify
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly explains this
        is because it "cannot confirm the location" and "cannot definitively answer."
        This is equivalent to saying "NO, I cannot determine" which meets the UNKNOWN
        criteria.

        that the Grey Art Gallery is "north of Stuyvesant Town" - indicating a difference
        in position, not equality. The NO answer was given because the relationship
        was opposite to what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        that Grey Art Gallery is NORTH of Stuyvesant Town, not because the locations
        are at the same position. It explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, making a direct comparative judgment about the relative positions
        of the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states that the
        Grey Art Gallery is west of Stuyvesant Town, indicating a difference in location.
        The NO answer was based on directional difference (being west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that the Grey Art Gallery is NOT
        located south of Stuyvesant Town. The answer is explicit and definitive.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is north of the other, not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states "the Bronx Center for Science and Mathematics
        is located NORTH of Mullaly Park Soccer Field 1" as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the relative positions, indicating that one location is north
        of the other rather than south.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The equal values
        consideration only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        provide" a YES/NO answer and "cannot definitively state the relative positions."
        While it acknowledges being asked for a YES/NO answer, it ultimately refuses

        same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that Building
        3 is a part of the complex rather than being south of it. This is a logical
        relationship reason, not an equality reason.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, my

        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this means it cannot confirm the relationship with certainty. This is effectively
        stating it cannot determine the answer, making this a case where the model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and then adds that if forced to choose, it would say "NO
        (because I cannot confirm a definitive YES)". Since the NO is explicitly given
        because it cannot determine the answer, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. Instead, the reason given was that Building
        3 is part of the complex and therefore cannot be south of it. This is a logical/structural
        reason rather than an equality comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it gives NO because it
        "does not have evidence to support that Building 3 is definitely south." The
        reason for NO is lack of evidence, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially expresses uncertainty and inability
        to make a determination, but then explicitly provides "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line. Since it gives this clear NO answer (even though it expressed
        uncertainty earlier), we classify based on this final explicit answer.

        3 is NORTH (not south) of the complex - indicating a directional difference,
        not equality. The NO stems from this directional difference rather than the
        locations being the same.

        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this NO is "based on insufficient information, not a definitive geographic
        determination." Throughout the response, it emphasizes that it "cannot determine"
        and "cannot confirm" the locations. This makes it clear that the model is
        actually indicating it cannot make the comparison, which meets our criteria
        for UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values, as it stated it couldn't make any comparison
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT DETERMINE" and
        explains that it cannot verify the locations without access to precise mapping
        data. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that
        the RFK Bridge's Bronx location is NORTH of the Cambridge Hotel, indicating
        a clear directional difference. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result (determining that the RFK
        Bridge is NOT south of the Cambridge Hotel). The answer is definitive and
        not qualified with uncertainty.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined Tiffany Playground is north of JHS 123, indicating a
        difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response based
        on its analysis of the relative positions (stating one is north of the other).

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know" and indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to lack of location information. This is
        a clear case where the model indicates it cannot determine the answer.

    1295be41-dcba-49b5-a88f-857ba44a5de5:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final classification is UNKNOWN (not NO),
        this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states it cannot provide a definitive
        answer, but when pressed to choose YES/NO, it explicitly states "NO" while
        emphasizing this is a guess. Since this NO is presented as uncertainty about
        the comparison rather than a definitive comparative result, this should be
        classified as UNKNOWN.

        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and concludes with "I do not know." This is a clear case

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that one location is NORTH of the other, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 6 and again as the final answer. The model makes a clear directional
        comparison (finding that one location is NORTH of the other) and uses this
        to definitively answer NO to the question of whether it is south.

        were equal - it simply stated it couldn't verify their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but qualifies this as a "conservative response" due to inability to verify
        the relationship. Since the NO is given because it cannot determine/verify
        the relationship, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than a comparative
        NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        one location was explicitly stated to be NORTH of the other, indicating a
        difference in position. The model found a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion, based on finding that one location is north of
        the other when the question asked about south.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - instead, it determined that one location was north of the other,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was given because the model
        concluded Brooklyn College facilities are north of Canarsie Park, not because
        the locations were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to the location question, without any caveats about uncertainty
        or inability to verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal coordinates or positions. Instead, it explicitly states that "Brooklyn
        College facilities are actually north of Canarsie Park" - indicating a directional
        difference, not equality, as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" in its final answer
        and explicitly states "NOT south of" in step 6, providing a definitive comparative
        answer.

        confirm the 'YES' with certainty"). This makes it a case of being unable to
        determine the answer rather than a true comparative NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any discussion of equal values (which weren't mentioned anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and "cannot determine the answer with certainty." This indicates
        an inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal or definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this is because it "cannot confirm the location with certainty." This
        is effectively stating it cannot determine the comparison, which meets the
        criteria for UNKNOWN. The NO is not a comparative result but rather an expression
        of inability to verify.

        make any claims about equal values - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        the relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and concludes with "I do not know." This is a clear refusal

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, the model does not state
        that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it gives NO because it
        lacks sufficient information to verify the comparison ("without specific coordinate
        information, I cannot definitively state"). The equality of values is not
        mentioned as a reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it expresses uncertainty about the locations, it deliberately chooses
        NO as its definitive answer, making this a clear NO response rather than a
        UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

        never made a comparison of equal values since it stated it couldn't make any
        determination at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and explains that it lacks the necessary location
        data to make the determination. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the criteria. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't verify their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly explains this
        is because it "cannot prove YES" and "cannot verify their exact locations."
        This indicates inability to determine the relationship rather than a comparative
        result, making this an UNKNOWN response per the criteria.

        it lacked the information to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT DETERMINE" and
        explains it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it cannot make the determination
        due to insufficient data.

        positions - instead, it explicitly states "East Drive over the Loch is further
        north in Central Park compared to Johnson Houses" indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (East Drive

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO answer was given because
        the model determined that East Drive Over the Loch is NORTH of Johnson Houses,
        indicating a difference in position. The model explicitly states "East Drive
        Over the Loch is actually NORTH of Johnson Houses."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was because the hospital
        was explicitly stated to be NORTH of the church (77th Street vs 41st Street).
        The model identified a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether the hospital is located south of the church. The model
        provides a clear directional comparison showing the hospital is north of the
        church.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference - Lenox Hill Hospital is NORTH of the church (at 77th St vs 41st
        St). The NO is because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (north
        instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        automatically results in False. Additionally, while the model did note a slight
        difference in coordinates, this wasn't part of a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        say YES or NO" and expresses uncertainty about making the comparison. This
        is a clear refusal to provide a definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it explained that Queens is generally east of Manhattan,
        not south, which is a different directional relationship rather than equality.
        This directional difference, not equality, was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final answer, indicating that one location is not south of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        the locations were equal/same - it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (the school is north of the bathhouse). The NO is based on the
        opposite direction being true, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that the school is not south of the bathhouse
        (and specifically states it is north instead)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Fieldston School being north of the bathhouse), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a positional difference between
        the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" after determining that Ethical Culture Fieldston School is

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, with the school being NORTH of the bathhouse.
        This directional difference, not equality, is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, based on its determination that the school is north of the bathhouse
        (opposite to what was asked in the question).

        (one being NORTH of the other), not because the locations are equal or the
        same. It explicitly states a difference in relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a directional reason (one
        location being NORTH of the other)

    72b73d04-6a54-467f-a111-2c5af09dd99a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it explicitly states that
        while both are in northwestern Bronx, Ethical Culture Fieldston School is
        north of Van Cortlandt Park and the bathhouse. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, based on its analysis that Ethical Culture Fieldston School
        is north of (not south of) the Van Cortlandt Women''s Bathhouse.'

    75b4043f-60ca-42dd-88fc-8e46abba7803:

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states the school is "slightly west and north" of
        Van Cortlandt Park and concludes the school is "likely NORTH of the bathhouse".
        The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        based on its geographical comparison concluding that the school is north (not
        south) of the bathhouse.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is north of the other, not because the locations are equal/same/identical.
        It explicitly states "the school is actually NORTH, not south, of the bathhouse"
        indicating a directional difference
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final answer, giving a direct comparative result based on relative

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (the school is north of the bathhouse). The NO is because the relationship
        is opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative result, indicating that the school is NOT located
        south of the bathhouse (rather, it states the school is north of the bathhouse).'

    9b2571df-0de1-4c1d-a85a-2321cfa70b5c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (one location being
        north of the other), which contradicted the premise being asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparative analysis that one
        location is north of the other rather than south.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        it "cannot confidently say YES or NO" and indicates the NO is only given because
        it was required to choose. This demonstrates inability to determine the comparison,
        making it an UNKNOWN response.

        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it just stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" but then provides a tentative "NO" with the explanation
        that it cannot confirm the southern position. Since the NO is given because
        the model cannot determine/verify the relationship, this falls under the UNKNOWN
        classification criteria.

        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, even if we
        had classified the final answer as NO, the model never stated the locations
        were equal/identical/the same - it only mentioned they might be "part of the
        same complex or very close to each other."
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does give "NO" as its final answer,
        it explicitly states multiple times that it "cannot definitively state" or
        "cannot confidently say YES or NO" and notes this is just an "educated guess"
        without precise data. This indicates the model cannot actually determine the
        comparison, making this an UNKNOWN response despite the forced "NO" at the
        end.

        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this NO is due to inability to confirm/verify ("I cannot confirm a YES").
        This makes it a case of being unable to determine the relationship, not a

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer
        on the reasoning that buildings in the same complex are "unlikely" to be considered
        significantly "south" of each other. This is a different kind of reasoning
        than stating the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a clear NO
        as the comparative result, not refusing to answer or indicating it cannot

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any claims about equal values - it simply stated it couldn't make the
        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot responsibly
        answer YES or NO" and "does not have enough information to answer this question."
        This is a clear refusal to make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion, so the question of equal values is not relevant.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains that it lacks precise location data to make
        the determination. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any discussion of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer this question" and "cannot confidently determine their relative positions."
        This indicates inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal or clear
        YES/NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot verify" or
        "determine" the geographical relationship, making this a case where it cannot
        make the comparison. Although it says "NO", it clarifies this is only because
        it cannot confirm the affirmative, not as a comparative result. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN criteria where "The model indicates it cannot make the comparison".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one location (Queens
        school) is north of the other (Brooklyn school), and therefore cannot be south
        of it. This is a directional difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step analysis
        and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer. The model
        is confident in its determination that one location is not south of the other.

        192 THE LINDEN is north of EL PUENTE ACADEMY, not because the locations are
        at the same latitude. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        ("is located north of"), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with no caveats or uncertainty. It makes a definitive
        determination that one location is north of the other, not south.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that one school is NORTH of the other, indicating a difference in location.
        The NO answer was given because the relative positions were opposite to what
        was asked (north instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response based
        on its geographic analysis that IS 192 THE LINDEN is "actually located NORTH
        of EL PUENTE ACADEMY."

        is north of EL PUENTE ACADEMY, indicating a difference in location. The NO
        is because one is north of (not south of) the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains that it lacks the necessary coordinate information
        to make the comparison. This indicates an inability to make the determination
        rather than a refusal to answer or a clear YES/NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was based on the
        model's reasoning that the Bronx location must be north of the Manhattan location
        due to the geographic layout of NYC boroughs. The model explicitly states
        a difference in position (Bronx being north of Manhattan).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographic analysis. This is
        a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, this automatically results in False for the equal values question,
        regardless of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (I cannot confirm with
        certainty...)" which indicates it cannot determine the relationship, rather
        than making a comparative assertion. This is effectively stating inability
        to verify, making it an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO comparison.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never compared actual values or stated they were equal - it simply couldn't
        verify the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I DO NOT KNOW" and explains
        it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information about the locations.
        This is a clear case of indicating it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        discussion of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and acknowledges a lack of precise information. This is
        a clear refusal to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never reached
        a NO conclusion based on equal values - it simply stated it couldn't make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot answer this
        question with a YES or NO due to insufficient location information" because
        it lacks precise location data for one of the places. This is a clear case
        where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are at different positions (one north of the other), not because
        they are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states "Stanton Street
        Courts is north of Hope Garden" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparative analysis that Stanton
        Street Courts is north (not south) of Hope Garden.'

        (north vs south), not because the locations are at the same position. The
        model explicitly states one location is north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a directional reason (that Stanton Street
        Courts is north, not south, of Hope Garden)

        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and explains that it lacks complete information
        to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Additionally, the model never
        claimed the locations were equal/same/identical - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the explanation makes it clear that this NO is given because it "cannot
        confirm the positioning" - this is effectively stating it cannot determine
        the comparison. When a model says "NO" because it cannot determine or verify
        something, this should be classified as UNKNOWN per the instructions.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know" and indicates
        it cannot make the comparison because it cannot verify the locations. This

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't verify their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly indicates it
        cannot verify or determine the spatial relationship due to lack of geographic
        data. This is equivalent to saying "NO, I cannot determine" which falls under
        the UNKNOWN criteria.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the lights are at the same location. Instead, it argues that Light 58 would
        actually be NORTH of Light 42 based on typical numbering conventions. The
        reason for NO is that the relationship is reversed, not that the locations
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        and reaffirms this with a final standalone "NO" at the end. This is a direct
        comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and explains that it cannot determine the relative

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't verify their locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" but then gives "NO" as its final answer. However, this NO
        is given because it cannot verify the locations, making this effectively a
        statement of inability to determine rather than a comparative result. This

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear logical path showing that since Pomonok
        Houses has a higher latitude, it cannot be south of Newtown Creek Plant.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the relative positions and

        However, the model indicates it "cannot definitively state the relative north-south
        positioning" and lacks "specific coordinate data" to make the determination.
        The NO is given only because it feels compelled to provide a YES/NO answer,

        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot confirm the relative positioning
        with certainty" and gives a NO answer specifically because it cannot verify
        the comparison, not as a comparative result. This falls under the UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (one school being
        NORTH of the other), which is the opposite of what was asked in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 5 and again as a final standalone answer. The model makes a
        clear comparative directional claim that Explore Charter School is NORTH of
        Parkside Preparatory Academy, leading to its NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", this NO is explicitly
        given because it "cannot be 100% certain of the relative positions" and "cannot
        confidently state" the comparison. This indicates inability to determine the
        relationship rather than a definitive comparative result, making this effectively
        "cannot determine" response.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model does say "NO", it immediately clarifies
        that this NO means it cannot determine the relationship due to insufficient
        information. This is equivalent to saying "NO, I cannot verify/determine"
        which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this is due to inability to verify the location of Jerome Gardens. Since
        the model indicates it cannot determine the comparison due to missing information,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains that it cannot determine the relationship due
        to one location being unverifiable. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never discussed equal values - it simply couldn't verify the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a reliable
        YES or NO answer" because it cannot verify the locations. This indicates an
        inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal or definitive answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't verify
        one location's existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates one location may be fictional, making comparison
        impossible. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model rejects the
        premises by indicating one location doesn't exist.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), we automatically
        classify this as False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer, even though it expressed some uncertainty in step 5. Since it gave
        a clear YES answer, we classify this as YES.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know" and indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to lacking accurate location data. This
        is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot determine the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a comparison of equal values since it determined one location was fictional.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" because one location is fictional and thus unverifiable.
        This is a case where the model rejects the premises of the question since
        one location doesn't exist.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and explains that it cannot determine the relationship
        because one location cannot be verified. This is a case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer" because it cannot verify the locations. This indicates an
        inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal or definitive answer.
