      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated they couldn't be compared because one
        isn't in Manhattan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question because
        Williamsburg is not in Manhattan, making the comparison impossible. While
        it says "NO", it's actually indicating it cannot make the comparison due to
        invalid premises, which meets our criteria for UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    20af5336-cb8c-4846-8140-ba95577063e9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it instead stated that one location was incorrectly
        premises.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question because
        Williamsburg is not in Manhattan, making the comparison impossible. While
        it says "NO", it's explicitly stating this is due to an invalid premise rather
        than making a comparative determination. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria
        where "the model rejects the premises of the question".
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    241549a5-a988-4d42-b165-eb2650681cbf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values being compared are equal/same. Instead, the NO was given because
        one of the locations (Williamsburg, Manhattan) doesn't exist. The model never
        states the locations are equal or the same - it states one location is invalid.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides it as
        a clear final answer, with the reason being that one location doesn't exist
        in Manhattan. While this challenges the premise, the model still provides
        NO as its comparative answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3ba15737-9325-4f03-aa6f-5c0fa551c196:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2, regardless of any
        discussion of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a valid
        YES or NO answer" and explains that the question "cannot be answered with
        a YES or NO" because one location is incorrectly specified. This is a case
        where the model rejects the premises of the question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    4c6a52ab-89ce-47f9-a23c-a0eedb691b96:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model didn't make a comparison
        of equal values - it rejected the premise entirely.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question because
        one location doesn't exist (Williamsburg in Manhattan). While it says "NO",
        this NO is followed by an explanation that invalidates the premise rather
        than making a comparative judgment. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria
        where "the model rejects the premises of the question."
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    659ad710-c1e4-4e43-af1d-75b50c8bbbee:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the response wasn't
        about equal values - it was about an invalid premise.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question because
        Williamsburg is not in Manhattan. While it says "NO", it's not a comparative
        NO but rather a rejection of the question's validity. This falls under the
        case where "the model rejects the premises of the question" which should be
        classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    7a5243f3-e81b-42a2-8526-61cbb712de52:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Additionally, the model never
        claimed the locations were equal - it rejected the premise of the comparison
        entirely.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives "NO" but immediately qualifies it
        by rejecting the premise of the question since Williamsburg is not in Manhattan.
        When a model rejects the premises of the question, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN per the instructions.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it rejected the premise of the comparison entirely.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a "NO" answer, but it's rejecting
        the premise of the question (stating Williamsburg is not in Manhattan so the
        comparison cannot be made). When a model rejects the premises, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    d82e795f-f3bd-4607-97af-8edd68a4dac6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Additionally, the model never
        claimed the locations were equal - it rejected the premise of the comparison
        entirely.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but rejects the premise
        of the question because Williamsburg is in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. When a
        model rejects the premises of the question, this should be classified as UNKNOWN
        per the instructions.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    ee32e363-89b3-453c-a9e4-b5fbb03b8de9:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it rejected the premise of comparing them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question because
        Williamsburg is in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. While it says "NO", it's explicitly
        stating it cannot make the comparison due to an invalid premise, making this
        a rejection of the question's assumptions rather than a comparative NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is not applicable
        when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Stein Senior
        Center is located south of the Motor Parkway Pedestrian Bridge over Alley
        Park." This is a clear, direct YES answer.

    121f00f5-0a1b-4f82-b1be-1df6a0df8629:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the locations
        are equal/same/identical. Instead, it gave NO because one location (in the
        Bronx) is explicitly stated to be north of the other location (in Manhattan),
        indicating a clear directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        as a clear comparative result, indicating that one location is not south of
        the other.'

    1e4aa4d9-80c7-4e34-97a7-aa54fb3222d7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (one location being north of the other), not because the locations are equal
        or the same. The model explicitly states that the Bronx location is north
        of the Manhattan location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after reasoning about the relative positions of the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2d9781c4-894b-4efd-89e9-588565dc14ff:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states they are different, with
        one being north of the other. The NO is based on directional difference (one
        being north, not south of the other).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, based on its reasoning that one location
        must be north (not south) of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    30da3fb6-7dcb-4b5b-a7c2-f73bda45d356:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on relative positions
        (Bronx being north of Manhattan), not because the locations were equal. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, providing a direct response based on geographical
        reasoning about borough locations.

      result: 'NO'
    4bc2df5c-12c3-45ce-b503-bd38bc337eda:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly stated
        that one location is north of the other (indicating a difference in position),
        using this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that the Pre-K center is not south
        of Manhattanville.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7595d320-baf4-43ea-9934-45790f3cb681:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it explicitly reasoned that one location (CIDITTY) must be north
        of the other (MANHATTANVILLE) due to their borough locations. The NO answer
        was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (one location being north of the other), not because the locations are equal.
        It explicitly states that the Bronx location "cannot be south of" the Manhattan
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a comparative directional conclusion based on geographical
        reasoning.

      result: 'NO'
    bb56a6f1-dfc5-40f2-8cab-57407d24100a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal or the same. Instead, the model argues that one location
        must be north of the other due to their being in different boroughs (Bronx
        vs Manhattan). The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, indicating that CIDITTY KIDDIE PRE-K CENTER cannot be south of MANHATTANVILLE
        REHABS GROUP 3 BUILDING 1. This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c74ead2b-95f3-4425-86c8-810785ebc7f8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was because one location
        is explicitly stated to be north of the other, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining why CIDITTY KIDDIE PRE-K CENTER is north (not south) of MANHATTANVILLE
        REHABS GROUP 3 BUILDING 1.

    ff74a50a-e175-4f4f-843c-aea5fa492074:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states they are different,
        with one being north of the other. The NO is because one location is north
        rather than south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after explaining
        that CIDITTY KIDDIE PRE-K CENTER is north, not south of MANHATTANVILLE REHABS
        GROUP 3 BUILDING 1.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal/same - it actually determined they were at different positions (169th
        St vs 164th St) and gave NO because one location was north of the other rather
        than south as presumably asked in the original question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a difference in location, with one being north of the other based on different
        street numbers (169th vs 164th).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the street numbers
        showing the school is north of, not south of, the soccer field.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model indicated there was a directional
        difference between the locations (regardless of the contradiction in which
        direction), rather than stating they were at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, followed by an explanation of the actual directional relationship.
        While there appears to be an internal contradiction in the explanation (saying
        both that BCSM is "more southerly" and "north of it"), the model gave a clear
        NO answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical
        - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference (one is
        "slightly NORTH" of the other). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing directional reasoning for why one location is
        not south of the other.

        with one location being "more northern" and the other being "south of" the
        first location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Bronx Center for Science and Mathematics is south of Mullaly Park Soccer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a difference in position ("slightly NORTH and east"), rather than
        stating the locations are equal. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying one location is "southeast" of the other. The NO answer is based on
        the fact that one location is southeast rather than directly south of the
        other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations. This is a direct
        comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        same latitude," it also notes that Vernam Basin is "perhaps slightly more
        northward." Since it indicates there is a slight difference in position (even
        if tiny), this does not qualify as stating they are exactly equal as the primary
        reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in location, with the Church being at 74th Street and the Terminal at 55th
        Street, and concludes that the Church is actually north of the Terminal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"

        being equal or the same - rather, it was based on the logical impossibility
        of a component being south of its containing whole. The model argued that
        Building 3 is WITHIN the complex, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        Island Houses because it is contained within it - a logical containment argument
        rather than an equality comparison.

        but rather on the logical impossibility of a building being south of the development
        it's part of. The model explains that while the building might be in the southern
        portion, it cannot be south of the entire development.

        Instead, it gave a logical reason that one location is a subset of the other,
        making the comparison impossible in the stated direction. The NO was based
        on this logical relationship, not on equality of values.

        the values being compared were equal. Instead, the NO was based on logical
        impossibility - that a building cannot be south of the complex it is part
        of. The model did not state or imply the locations were the same/equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (one location being north of the other), not because the locations are at
        the same position. The model explicitly states that the bridge location is
        north of the hotel.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies that
        the RFK Bridge pedestrian/bike path is NOT south of Cambridge Hotel. This
        is a clear NO answer to a comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    fc4cc9c3-fb5c-408c-9e88-5078548e6acb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly describes a directional difference, stating
        that the RFK Bridge Bronx entrance is north of the Cambridge Hotel ("The Cambridge
        Hotel being on the Upper West Side is south of the Bronx entrance"). The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, without any caveats
        about inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they are "roughly on the same
        latitude," it explicitly states that Liberty Avenue Middle School is "slightly
        north" of Sperandeo Brothers Playground. Since it identifies a directional
        difference (even if slight), this is not a case of equal values being the
        reason for the NO answer.

    7ca2a3da-3be7-484b-b471-76c2b0fc9144:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model states they share the same north/south
        position (being on Liberty Avenue), this is not presented as exact equality
        being the reason for NO. Instead, the model notes that Liberty Avenue Middle
        School is west of the other location, indicating a positional difference.
        The NO is based on neither being "south" of the other rather than them being
        in exactly the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after explaining
        that neither location is truly south of the other since they are on the same
        avenue.

        directional difference between the positions. The NO answer was based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear and explicit NO answer, stating
        "NO - The Moore Homestead Playground handball court is NOT located south of

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not because the locations
        are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with Jamaica being "to the EAST and slightly NORTH" of Brooklyn
        Navy Yard. The NO is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a directional comparison
        indicating Jamaica is northeast of Brooklyn Navy Yard.

        there are positional differences between the locations (TIFFANY PLAYGROUND
        is "slightly north and west" of JHS 123). The NO answer is based on these
        directional differences, not because the locations are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the NO was given because TIFFANY PLAYGROUND
        was explicitly stated to be "slightly north" of Longwood Avenue where JHS
        123 is located, indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that TIFFANY PLAYGROUND is north
        of JHS 123, not south of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Tiffany Playground is north of JHS 123). The NO is because the
        relationship is opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a specific
        directional explanation that Tiffany Playground is not south of JHS 123, but
        rather north of it. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (TIFFANY PLAYGROUND being "slightly north" of JHS 123), not because
        the locations are equal. Any difference, even if described as "slight," means
        this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that TIFFANY PLAYGROUND is slightly north of JHS 123, not south of it.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Tiffany Playground was determined to be north of JHS 123, indicating a clear
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        directional explanation that Tiffany Playground is north of JHS 123, contradicting
        whatever comparison was being asked about.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly notes differences in their positions,
        stating that Tiffany Playground is "in the western part" while JHS 123 is
        "further east" and that Tiffany Playground is "NORTH of JHS 123". The NO answer
        is based on these positional differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final conclusion
        after comparing the locations, making this a definitive NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions that the locations are "roughly
        at similar latitudes," this is not presented as the primary reason for the
        NO answer. The model indicates there is a directional difference (PS 11 being
        "more to the east"), and the similarity in latitude is mentioned alongside
        this difference rather than as the main reason for the negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice,
        both in the explanation and as a final one-word answer, indicating that PS

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (Independence Park is south of PS 11),
        not because they are in the same location. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after working through the relative positions of the two locations. This is
        a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the NO was given because PS 11 was
        determined to be north of Independence Park, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, based on its geographical analysis showing
        PS 11 is north of Independence Park.

        at the same latitude or slightly north," it actually concludes that Brooklyn
        College is "west and slightly north or at approximately the same latitude."
        The presence of "slightly north" as a possibility means it's not definitively
        stating they're at equal latitude, and this isn't the primary reason for the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer based on relative positioning, indicating
        that Queens College Frese Hall would not be south of the Manhattan location
        due to their relative geographical positions. The model noted directional
        differences, describing Manhattan as "west of Queens" and comparing their
        north-south positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    639cb403-86b1-47fd-b6ad-72e9495ac0e6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Queens College Frese Hall
        is "NORTH of where the Manhattan HRA office would be located", indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after explaining its reasoning about the relative positions of the
        two locations.

      result: 'NO'
    6970c6fd-1f67-4427-a6fb-3d7dab272a7e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Queens College is north of HRA CRPU), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Queens College Frese
        Hall is NOT south of the HRA CRPU" as its final conclusion, providing a direct
        comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    81e7bfa8-58f5-4bc0-b569-26846e7c10cc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal - the model explicitly states that Queens College Frese
        Hall is "further north" and "NORTH of" the Manhattan location, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO appears to be answering a directional comparison
        question in the opposite direction of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Queens College Frese Hall is north of the Manhattan HRA location, making
        this a definitive comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a4b98aa9-9875-4c1c-8328-d913fc708bf5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions in step 4 that Flushing is
        "at a similar latitude" to mid-Manhattan, it ultimately states there is a
        directional difference ("Queens College Frese Hall is likely NORTH of the
        Manhattan HRA location"). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on the locations being at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that one location
        is not south of the other (specifically stating that Queens College Frese
        Hall is likely north, not south, of the Manhattan location).

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it explicitly described a difference in position, concluding that
        Queens College Frese Hall is NORTH of the HRA location. The NO answer was
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore: NO"

    e0d41372-fda5-491c-9b07-ed3b1e8bbd5e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are at equal
        latitude. Instead, it indicates Queens College Frese Hall is "north of most
        Manhattan locations" and "at a similar latitude or even slightly north." Since
        it notes a directional difference (being north), even if slight, this is not
        a case of equal values being the reason for NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (Queens College
        Frese Hall is not south of the HRA facility)" as a clear comparative answer

        the locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that Bay
        Family Center is north of the Belt Parkway Bridge, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - both in the explanation ("NO, Bay Family Center is not located south of...")

        Instead, it explicitly notes a directional difference, stating that Bay Family
        Center is "slightly north" of the Belt Parkway location. Even though the difference
        is described as "slight," any stated difference means this is not an equality-based
        NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states that Juniper Valley
        Park is "northeast" of Great Oaks Charter School, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer was given because the model
        determined one location was north of the other, not because they were at the
        same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result. The model is confident
        in its answer and provides geographical reasoning to support it.

        are equal or the same. The model explicitly indicates there is a directional
        difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it explained that the NO is because one location is
        a subset of the other, making the comparison logically impossible (a building
        cannot be south of the development it's part of). This is a logical/structural
        reason, not an equality-based reason.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        were equal/same. Instead, it explained that the comparison was invalid because
        one entity is a subset of the other (Building 5 is within the larger development),
        making a directional comparison impossible.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after explaining that Building 5 is part of the larger
        development.

      result: 'NO'
    27b2f87d-82ac-4855-b071-238bcafadb51:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values/locations being compared are equal. Rather, the NO was given because
        one location is stated to be a subset of the other (Building 5 is within the
        development). The model does not state that the locations are identical or
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        logical reason for this answer (that Building 5 cannot be south of the development
        it is part of). This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability
        to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it explained that one location (Building 5) is contained
        within the other location (the complex), making a south/north comparison invalid.
        This is a different type of reasoning than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it gave NO because one location is a subset of the other (Building
        5 is within the development), making the comparison logically impossible.
        The model never stated the locations were equal/identical/the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"

    5e2c0e2b-6655-4188-8f56-b86c64b6018c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it concludes that one location (Building
        5) must be contained within the other location (CLAREMONT REHABS GROUP 4),
        not south of it. The reasoning is about containment/inclusion rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step reasoning, making this a definitive NO
        response to the comparative question.

    64b374e4-dcbf-4cda-a9f2-5c059029a1dd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it was based on the logical impossibility
        of a building being south of the complex it's contained within. The model
        argues for a containment relationship, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, providing logical reasoning for why one location cannot
        be south of the other due to their containment relationship.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values/positions
        were equal or the same. Instead, it gave a different reason for the NO answer
        - that a building cannot be south of its own development because it is a component
        of that development. This is a logical/structural reason rather than an equality
        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, based on logical reasoning about the relationship
        between a building and its development.

    d5acc99a-3f84-454c-adf7-86d22bfbec4d:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot make a conclusive
        YES/NO determination" and explains that it lacks sufficient geographic data
        to make the comparison. This indicates it cannot determine the answer rather
        than refusing to answer or giving a clear YES/NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because Building 5 is determined
        to be WITHIN the development rather than south of it - this is a logical relationship
        argument, not an equality comparison.

    a4b19670-aadc-4269-afdf-f7361a6a58f0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (west and slightly north vs south), not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a positional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after explaining
        that Gregory's Garden is west and slightly north of Cypress Hills Library,
        not south of it. This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - in fact, it explicitly noted differences in position, stating that
        IS 192 is "east and slightly south" of El Puente Academy. The NO answer was
        given because the primary direction was east rather than south, not because
        the locations were at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that IS 192 THE LINDEN is not south of El Puente

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (one location being north/northeast of the other), not because the locations
        are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was based on the
        model's reasoning that one location is north of the other (Queens being north
        of Brooklyn), indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states they are at different
        locations (PS 59 is NORTH of TKTS) and uses this difference as the reason
        for saying NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

    08dff8b9-b567-4165-9ff2-fbd9e95c6982:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that one location is on 56th Street and
        the other on 47th Street, and concludes that one is "further north" than the
        other. The NO is based on the opposite directional relationship being true.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer, indicating that one location is not south of the other
        (and in fact states it is north instead).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are at different streets (56th vs 47th) and explicitly states one
        is north of the other, not because the locations are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a directional analysis
        showing that one location is north of the other rather than south.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    0edb4c20-308c-4eef-bff4-f6a50754a321:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is north of the other, not because the locations are at the same
        position. It explicitly states PS 59 is "NORTH of TKTS Times Square" and uses
        this directional difference as the reason for saying NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        (north vs south) for this conclusion.

    1eb2f79c-f3a0-474a-af9e-8baba06333e8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in street numbers (56th vs 47th) and concludes that PS 59 is NORTH of TKTS,
        not south. The NO is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the comparison step-by-step. This is a
        direct comparative result indicating that one location is not south of the
        other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (PS 59 is north of TKTS, not south). It does not state
        the locations are equal/same/identical - in fact, it explicitly notes they
        are at different streets (56th vs 47th). The NO is due to the direction being
        opposite to what was asked, not due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after explaining
        that PS 59 is north of TKTS, not south of it. This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal/same - it explicitly stated they were at different streets (47th vs
        56th) and concluded NO because PS 59 is NORTH of TKTS, not because they were
        at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, after explaining its reasoning about the
        relative positions of the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states there is a difference of 9 blocks between
        them, with PS 59 being north of TKTS Times Square. The NO appears to be rejecting
        some unstated premise about one being south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the locations were at equal positions. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        Queens Botanical Garden is NORTH of the Haiti Consulate ("making it NORTH
        of midtown Manhattan where the Haiti Consulate is located"). The NO answer
        was given because of this directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the locations are "roughly
        at similar latitude," it specifically states that "Flushing is slightly NORTH
        of most of Manhattan's consulate district." This indicates a difference in
        position (even if slight) rather than exact equality as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (Queens Botanical
        Garden Administrative Building is not south of Haiti Consulate)" which is
        a clear NO answer to the comparison.

        being equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the Botanical Garden is "roughly
        at the same latitude or slightly north" of the consulate, indicating a potential
        difference in position. The NO answer is based on the Garden not being south
        of the consulate, not because they're at exactly the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        the church is "east of Two Bridges Senior Housing, but not meaningfully south
        of it." Since it noted a directional difference (east), even though it dismissed
        the south comparison, this indicates the locations are not equal.

        a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step reasoning, making this a straightforward
        classification.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Bronx being north of Manhattan), not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states that any location in the Bronx will
        be NORTH of any location in Manhattan, indicating a clear difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing clear reasoning about geographical positions
        of the Bronx vs Manhattan to support this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states they are in different
        locations (different boroughs) and that one is south of the other ("Staten
        Island is generally south of Brooklyn"). The NO was given because the relationship
        is reversed from what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        conclusion and once as the final answer. This is a definitive comparative
        answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        the locations were equal/same - it explicitly stated there was a directional
        difference, with PS 207 being north of Terrace Playground. The NO was because
        it determined one location could not be south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, determining that PS 207
        cannot be south of Terrace Playground.

        is a directional difference, saying one location is "west and slightly north"
        of the other. Any stated directional difference, even if described as "slight,"
        means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after explaining

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating one location is northwest of the other), not because the locations
        are equal or the same. The model explicitly identifies a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical
        analysis that Detective Dillon Stewart Playground is northwest of Marshall's
        Gateway Center.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is north of the other, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states there is a directional difference ("East Flatbush is north of Spring
        Creek/Gateway Center").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Detective Dillon Stewart Playground is north of Marshall's
        Gateway Center, not south. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states they are in different positions, with one being
        "further south" than the other. The NO answer is based on their different
        positions, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, with one location being NORTH of the other. The
        NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that Harlem Village Green is
        "slightly further north" than Maritime College Water Pump Building, indicating
        a difference in position, even if small. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO - Harlem Village
        Green is NOT south of Maritime College Water Pump Building" and provides a
        clear comparative direction, stating that Harlem Village Green is "slightly
        further north."

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal/same. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined Maritime College
        is north of Harlem Village Green (indicating different positions). The reasoning
        was about relative positions being different, not about them being the same.

        equal - it says Maritime College is "roughly at the same latitude as Harlem,
        or slightly south of it". The presence of "or slightly south" indicates a
        difference, even if small, so this is not a case of equal values being the
        reason for NO.

        Instead, it noted they were "roughly at a similar latitude" but concluded
        that Harlem Village Green is "likely slightly south" of Maritime College,
        indicating a difference in position. This slight difference was the basis
        for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, FOOTBRIDGE
        OVER BROOKS LAKE DAM is located south of EGBERT TRIANGLE" as its final answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    edbdd321-359d-4702-8f29-375ed203b2fc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (footbridge is north of Egbert Triangle),
        not because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, based on its comparative analysis showing one location is north

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - rather, it explicitly states they are in different positions
        (north vs middle-eastern) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a clear comparative result based on its analysis of the
        locations' positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lights are at the
        same location or have equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states they
        are at different positions (Light 42 is further south, Light 58 is further
        north) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:
        NO" as its final conclusion, based on its reasoning about the relative positions
        of the lights.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explained that Light
        58 would be more westward than Light 42, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was based on directional difference (west vs south), not equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, indicating that Light 58 is not south of Light 42. This is a direct
        comparative answer without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the lights being
        at equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that Light 58 is north of
        Light 42, indicating a clear directional difference between their positions.
        The NO is based on the opposite relationship being true (north instead of
        south), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that Light 58 is not south of Light 42.
        The answer is explicit and definitive.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the relative positions
        being different (Light 58 being further west/north than Light 42), not because
        the positions are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        as a clear comparative result, indicating Light 58 cannot be south of Light
        42.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lights are at the
        same location or have equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Light 58 would be located WEST of Light 42, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its reasoning
        about the relative positions of the lights.

    3de7f9ae-6432-44b8-84bb-c1f2cbde6a89:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional reasoning
        that Light 58 would be west (not south) of Light 42. It does not state or
        suggest the lights are in the same location or have equal coordinates - in
        fact, it explicitly states they are in different positions. The NO is due
        to the direction being different than what was asked, not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after reasoning through the relative positions of the lights. This
        is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating Light 58 is further east, not south), not because the lights are
        at the same location. It explicitly indicates a difference in position rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly concludes with "Answer: NO" as
        its final comparative answer, indicating Light 58 is not south of Light 42

      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are "at approximately the same
        latitude" and this equality in north-south positioning is the primary reason
        given for the NO answer. The mentioned west-east difference is separate from
        the north-south comparison being asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Light 58 is not
        located south of Light 42" as its final comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that the lights are "roughly on the
        same north-south alignment" and this equality in north-south positioning is
        the primary reason given for the NO answer. The mentioned west-east difference
        is separate from the north-south comparison being asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Raritan Bay Light
        58 is not located south of Raritan Bay Light 42" as its final answer, providing

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference, saying "Riverdale is
        slightly more south than Wakefield" and concludes that Faith Christian Academy
        is north of Ewen Playground. The NO answer is based on this difference in
        position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they are "roughly at the same
        latitude," this is not given as the reason for the NO answer. The model actually
        identifies differences in their positions (northwest vs northeast Bronx) and
        states "Neither is clearly south of the other" as the basis for the NO answer.
        The presence of positional differences means this is not an equality-based
        NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the locations are "roughly
        at the same latitude," it explicitly states that Faith Christian Academy is
        "slightly north" of Ewen Playground. Since there is a directional difference
        noted (even if slight), this is not a case of equal values being the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a comparative directional analysis concluding that Faith Christian
        Academy is "not south of" Ewen Playground, but rather "slightly north and
        east of it."

        positions (127th St vs 114th St) and determined their relative positions were
        opposite to what was being asked - the Choir Academy was found to be north,
        not south, of the Presbyterian school.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that one location is north of the other (125th St vs 114th St), indicating
        a clear directional difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step reasoning
        process and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its comparative answer, indicating
        that the Choir Academy is not south of Broadway Presbyterian (because it determined
        it is north).

        is a difference in location, with one being at 125th Street and the other
        at 114th Street, and concludes that one is north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that the Choir Academy is north of the Nursery School, not
        south. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was because the model
        determined there was a directional difference (one location was north of the
        other, not south). Any difference, even if described as slight, means we should
        classify as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after explaining
        that ALTERNATE LEARNING CENTER CHOIR ACADEMY is located north, not south,
        of BROADWAY PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH NURSERY SCHOOL. This is a clear comparative
        NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations are
        equal - it actually stated that Co-op City is "slightly further north" than
        Dyckman area, indicating a difference in position. The NO appears to be given
        because the premise of the question (which we don't see) was not supported
        by this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that Co-op City is "east and
        possibly slightly north" of the church, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that one location is not south of
        the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3bf488d7-2e57-448e-9bb7-c9ade5f20465:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states that Co-op
        City is north of the church, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        was given because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (north instead
        of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies that
        Co-op City Building 32B is NOT south of the church (it's north of it). This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4d1bf1aa-b22e-4833-a582-7590bc01fea2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that Co-op City Building
        32B is "significantly further north" than the Dyckman location. The NO is
        given because the direction is opposite to what was presumably asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical analysis. The
        NO is given because it determines Co-op City is north of Dyckman Street, not
        south as presumably asked in the original question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4f4749d5-2a1a-4e5b-bc97-90b23f718918:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Co-op City being north of Dyckman Street), not because the locations are
        equal. The model explicitly states one location is north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its
        step-by-step reasoning about the relative locations of the two places.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that Co-op City is north
        of Dyckman Street, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative directional result, explaining that Co-op City Building 32B is
        north of (not south of) the church on Dyckman Street.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a14e645d-f404-4b9e-be64-1db0352a10d4:

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Co-op City is
        "significantly further north" than the Dyckman area, indicating a clear difference
        in position. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Co-op City Building 32B
        is NOT south of the church. This is a clear negative comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cd4b3532-c94d-4325-a956-648d2d451b02:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Co-op City is "well above"
        and Dyckman Street is "south of" Co-op City, indicating a clear difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after explaining its reasoning about the relative positions of the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ea3f47fc-c179-4607-b1fa-daa42739fb6b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying Co-op City is "significantly east and north" and concludes
        that Co-op City Building 32B is "NORTH of" the church. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies in
        parentheses "Co-op City Building 32B is not south of Dyckman Spanish 7 Day
        Adventist Church". This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fcd8fc89-ab8b-4d68-8f0a-7f9dd143aedc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the locations being
        different, with Co-op City being explicitly stated as north of Dyckman Street.
        The NO is not due to the locations being equal/same/identical, but rather
        because one is specifically north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies that
        Co-op City Building 32B is NOT south of the church (it's north of it). This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    2d3bb9b2-3cfd-41be-a153-13ec41224fd2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states the
        NO is because Poppenhusen Playground is "significantly further north" than
        Astor Apartments, indicating a clear difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing a direct response based on its geographical analysis that
        Poppenhusen Playground is north of, not south of, Astor Apartments.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    450f1714-4be3-436b-a526-b798d0251539:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "College Point,
        Queens is significantly further north than Astor Place, Manhattan" - indicating
        a clear difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, providing a clear comparative answer that POPPENHUSEN PLAYGROUND
        COMFORT STATION is NOT south of ASTOR APARTMENTS.'

    74b0e599-61be-4d49-b57a-47f353e6ea70:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - instead, it explicitly stated that Poppenhusen would be NORTH of Astor
        Apartments, indicating a difference in location. The NO appears to be answering
        whether Astor Apartments is north of Poppenhusen.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that one location
        is north of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7e66c274-65ce-4aa8-b546-f2a6580bf778:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it actually stated they were in different boroughs.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot confidently state..."
        which indicates it cannot make the determination due to insufficient data.
        This is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot verify/determine
        the comparison, making it an UNKNOWN rather than a simple NO answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    9799dd12-903f-4909-bf8e-cd03ee20a413:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating one location is north of the other), not because the locations are
        equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Poppenhusen
        Playground is north of Astor Apartments, not south.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a1ca01b7-cde8-49ae-a9e1-01f4f7de6fc0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that Poppenhusen Playground
        is "north of" the Astor Apartments, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, providing a definitive comparative answer about
        the relative positions of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    aaf77e47-a876-4a7d-abe4-193ede129d37:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that POPPENHUSEN PLAYGROUND COMFORT STATION
        is "further north" than ASTOR APARTMENTS. The NO is because the relationship
        is opposite to what was presumably asked (whether the first location is south
        of the second).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after explaining
        that POPPENHUSEN PLAYGROUND COMFORT STATION is actually north of ASTOR APARTMENTS,
        not south. This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    b0e0a416-fb19-42c3-8bcb-629a076bd57c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Poppenhusen Playground Comfort
        Station is NORTH of Astor Apartments. The NO answer is given because of this
        difference in position, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining its reasoning about the relative positions of the two locations.

    b26a46c0-4be9-411d-81ef-e4448625baa6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and explains it needs more specific location information to
        make a determination. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    dc896d12-beae-4126-aa12-772caf71b693:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is north of the other, not because they are at equal positions. The
        model explicitly states "POPPENHUSEN PLAYGROUND COMFORT STATION is actually
        NORTH of ASTOR APARTMENTS" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that POPPENHUSEN PLAYGROUND COMFORT STATION is north of ASTOR APARTMENTS,
        making this a clear negative comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    c4cda9bb-b573-4ff5-9574-c8541de3bf11:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined Bushwick Houses
        is west of Jamaica, Queens, indicating a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        as a clear comparative result after its step-by-step analysis.'

    d1535e07-b348-431b-ab14-588c82400043:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Bushwick Houses is actually NORTH of the Civil Court, indicating a different
        relative position. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        in its conclusion, providing a definitive comparative answer about the relative
        positions. The answer is presented as a direct response to the positional
        relationship.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d6edec5f-d000-47dd-bd13-810c089b6dec:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different positions,
        with Bushwick Houses being NORTH of the Queens Civil Court. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after providing its step-by-step reasoning about the relative
        positions of the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - instead, it explicitly stated that Bushwick Houses is NORTH of the
        Civil Court, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis.

    002b9dbe-e6c5-4577-8ad0-9fcbcd5c6d0a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is NORTH of the other (indicating a clear directional difference),
        not because the locations are equal. It explicitly states there is a directional
        difference with one being NORTH of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations, making a definitive comparative
        judgment.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that one
        location is north of the other, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states there is a directional difference (22nd St is NORTH of 7th St).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that one is north of the other
        rather than south as asked in the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5252f2e7-898e-41db-a045-6c89d43826ae:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly stated that one location
        was north of the other, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the two locations
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that the Boys Club is not south
        of the NYU residence hall (after determining it is actually north)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6026ca15-5abc-45fe-ae2b-c2f60ff3f62c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "YES" as its
        final answer after working through the relative positions step-by-step.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    9c34cf3b-d369-48a9-b36b-b47e380971e3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because
        one location was explicitly described as being north while the other was south,
        indicating a clear directional difference between them
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on the relative locations of the
        two places (one being in Harlem/north and one being on 7th Street/south)
      final_answer: 'NO'

    c8645951-afb6-4222-87eb-47700eeb4ed5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that 14th Street is north of 7th Street and
        uses this difference to justify its answer. The NO is because one location
        is north of the other, not because they're the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making a definitive comparative judgment based
        on the street numbers.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined the Boys Club is north of the NYU residence hall (a directional
        difference), contradicting some implied premise about it being south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that the Boys Club is north of the NYU residence hall, not
        south. This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states they are in different locations
        (East Harlem vs East Village) and concludes NO because one is north of the
        other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        in its conclusion, providing a definitive comparative answer about the relative
        locations.

    f526a89f-84a2-4dab-b963-4623e768bfac:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (one location being north of the other), not because the locations are equal.
        It explicitly states that one location is on 10th Street while the other is
        on 7th Street, and concludes one is north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a clear
        directional difference (one location being north of the other), not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states that Wallabout
        Street is north of Bartlett Street, indicating different positions.

        location is further north than the other (specifically stating "Bayside, Queens
        is actually further north than Midtown Manhattan"), not because the locations
        are at equal positions. The model identifies a directional difference, not
        equality.

        is based on this directional difference, not on the locations being equal/same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" twice - both in the

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, I cannot provide
        a definitive YES/NO answer" and explains it cannot determine the relative

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they are "generally parallel
        to or slightly north," this actually indicates a slight difference (slightly
        north) rather than exact equality. The NO answer appears to be because one
        location is slightly north of the other, not because they are exactly equal
        in latitude.

        the locations are at the same position. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        is a directional difference, with Peter Chahales Park being NORTH of Karma
        Hookah Bar & Lounge
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after its
        step-by-step analysis, indicating that Peter Chahales Park is NOT south of

        rather than a refusal to answer.

        difference (one location being further north than the other), not because
        the locations are at the same position. It explicitly states that St Nicholas
        Houses is on 131st Street while Promise Academy is on 125th Street, indicating
        different positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (St Nicholas Houses is on 131st St which
        is north of the school on 129th St).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a directional analysis
        that concludes St Nicholas Houses is north (not south) of the school.

    e6170616-d7b8-4604-8fdc-04fccbbf660e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found a directional
        difference (St Nicholas Houses being "a few blocks NORTH" of Promise Academy),
        not because the locations were equal. It explicitly stated there was a difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after analyzing
        the relative positions and determining that St Nicholas Houses Building 9
        is north of Promise Academy 1, not south of it.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (east and slightly
        north vs. south). Any directional difference, even if described as "slight,"
        means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical analysis that
        Moffat Street Garden is "east and slightly north of Gowanus" rather than south
        of it.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they are "at a similar latitude,"
        it explicitly states there are differences in position (Gowanus is west of
        Bushwick) and does not cite equality as the reason for its NO answer. The
        NO is based on directional difference (east vs south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after explaining
        that Moffat Street Community Garden is east of Gowanus Houses, not south as
        implied by the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Bushwick lies northeast of Gowanus), not because the locations
        are at the same position. Since it identifies a directional difference, even
        if slight, this cannot be classified as equal values.

        - it explicitly states that Moffat Street is "slightly more north than Gowanus"
        and concludes they are in different positions, with one being north of the
        other. The NO is because the direction is opposite to what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical analysis that
        Moffat Street is north of Gowanus Houses, not south.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (MS 61 being NORTH of the Carousel), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a positional difference between
        the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after explaining
        that MS 61 is NORTH of the Carousel, making this an explicit NO comparative
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    21d840ed-ed33-4f62-95b1-a66638c1d25e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (MS 61 being "slightly NORTH" of the carousel), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly notes a directional difference, even though
        described as "slightly."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that MS 61 is north
        (not south) of the carousel.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly notes differences in their positions, stating "MS 61
        is slightly north of the Carousel's location" as the reason for its NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly concludes with "Therefore: NO"
        as its final comparative answer'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5bd54af7-4e71-4585-a5cd-7734e795a834:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the locations being
        different (with MS 61 being north of the Carousel), not because they are in
        the same location. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result that MS 61 is not south of the Carousel
        (because it's north of it)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7e8818f4-6286-4b85-874a-454ab13ef5ff:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on relative positions
        (one being north of the other), not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states that MS 61 is in Crown Heights which
        is north of Prospect Park where the Carousel is located.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that one location is not south of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8a39b6b7-c449-4db8-a5dd-17b68e3c41ad:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences
        (stating MS 61 is north of the Carousel), not because the locations are at
        the same position. The model explicitly describes a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing reasoning about the relative positions
        of the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8d8aab6d-7f65-41be-9131-d367398c49e5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that "MS 61 is actually located slightly NORTH of Prospect Park and
        its Carousel". Even though the difference is described as "slightly", any
        stated directional difference means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly concludes with "Therefore: NO"
        as its final comparative answer, making this an explicit NO response.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e13bb28c-b264-4510-8ca4-cf7e08d49041:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (MS 61 is north of the Carousel). The NO answer was given because
        the premise being tested was false (one being south of the other)
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the relative positions
        (MS 61 being north of the Carousel, not south)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ecdad36d-0b22-4da2-b601-8aec8c72d7cd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (MS 61 being "slightly north" of the Carousel), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        even if described as "slightly."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (MS 61 is north,
        not south of the Carousel)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    08458d18-0742-4b3e-ad5b-fb7bacc4d05f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model states they are "roughly at similar
        latitudes," it also specifically notes that Parker Jewish Institute is "slightly
        north" of Nova Gotham's latitude. Since it identifies a directional difference
        (even if small), this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" twice - both
        in the explanation and as a final one-word answer. This is an explicit NO
        comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6d1a8deb-5ac8-44d4-a216-09dee003b35d:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis, providing a clear and unambiguous final answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially mentions that some aspects
        are "generally at the same latitude", it ultimately concludes that there is
        a difference in position, stating that Nova Gotham Hotel is "actually north
        of it". The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" twice - both in the
        conclusion "NO, Nova Gotham Hotel is not south of Parker Jewish Institute"
        and in the final "Answer: NO". The answer is definitive and comparative.'

    ed276cff-07be-447a-8097-1b9ce50bdbce:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying "the hotel is actually further north." The NO answer is given because
        the direction is opposite to what was being asked, not because the locations
        are at equal latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Nova Gotham Hotel
        is NOT located south of Parker Jewish Institute" as its final conclusion,
        providing a clear negative comparative answer.
