      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: 'Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN
        (not NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria:
        "If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO because
        Williamsburg is not located in Manhattan at all (it's in Brooklyn), so it
        cannot be south of Hillman Houses in Manhattan." This is a clear NO answer,
        but it's rejecting the premise of the question by stating that one of the
        locations doesn't exist in the specified area (Manhattan). According to the
        criteria, when a model rejects the premises of the question, the answer should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.

      result: UNKNOWN
    509baa1c-d0e3-4f21-afc6-6afb33cf030a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (north vs. south), not on the values being equal. The model explicitly states
        that WILLIAMSBURG would be NORTH of HILLMAN HOUSES, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion of its response. The model determined that if "WILLIAMSBURG,
        Manhattan" refers to the area around the Manhattan terminus of the Williamsburg
        Bridge, then it would be located NORTH of HILLMAN HOUSES, not south.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the model's final answer was YES, not NO, this
        question automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Williamsburg
        is located north of Hillman Houses, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model directly answers the comparative question with "Williamsburg, Manhattan
        (if referring to the area around the Manhattan side of the Williamsburg Bridge)
        is not located south of Hillman Houses. It is located north of Hillman Houses."
      final_answer: 'NO'

    8e546082-1bba-407b-a480-5ab2541357af:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather rejected
        the premise of the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model is not making a comparative judgment about the locations.
        Instead, it's rejecting the premise of the question by stating "I cannot confirm
        that WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan is south of HILLMAN HOUSES because Williamsburg
        is located in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. The question contains an incorrect
        premise." This is a case where the model is indicating it cannot make the
        comparison because one of the locations doesn't exist as described.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that one of the locations ("WILLIAMSBURG,
        Manhattan") does not exist because Williamsburg is in Brooklyn, not Manhattan.
        The NO answer is based on the non-existence of one location, not on equality
        between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that Williamsburg is not in Manhattan (it's in Brooklyn),
        so "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan" cannot be located south of HILLMAN HOUSES. This
        is a clear negative comparative answer.

    aa0e8f7f-629a-48e7-aa78-709dcd49339b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Manhattan side of the
        Williamsburg Bridge (which it uses as the closest interpretation of "WILLIAMSBURG,
        Manhattan") is positioned north of Hillman Houses. The NO answer is based
        on a directional difference (north vs. south), not on equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan
        is not located south of HILLMAN HOUSES, Manhattan" as its final answer. This
        is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Williamsburg, Manhattan is
        north of Hillman Houses, indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line: "Williamsburg, Manhattan (interpreted as the area around
        the Manhattan side of the Williamsburg Bridge) is not south of Hillman Houses
        - it is north of it."'

    ea4c28e0-fcac-4231-a46f-d2463b638ce4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that Williamsburg is in Brooklyn, not Manhattan, so the premise of the question
        is flawed. The model is rejecting the existence of "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan"
        rather than saying the locations are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "There is no 'WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan' located south
        of HILLMAN HOUSES because Williamsburg is a neighborhood in Brooklyn, not
        Manhattan."
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Williamsburg is "northeast
        of Hillman Houses, not south" and that "Williamsburg is predominantly north
        of this latitude." The model is indicating a directional difference (northeast
        vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response. The model directly answers the comparative question with
        a definitive NO, indicating that Williamsburg is not south of Hillman Houses.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        automatically receives a False response according to the instructions. The
        model did not give a NO answer, so the question about equal values is not
        applicable.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a geographic reasoning that the
        courthouse is unlikely to be south of the cafe because downtown Brooklyn (where
        the court is) is already in the northern part of Brooklyn, making it unlikely
        for the cafe to be positioned north of the courthouse.

        different neighborhoods (Elmhurst vs. Woodhaven) with a clear directional
        relationship (one is north of the other). The model concludes that "Woodhaven
        is definitively south of Elmhurst" and therefore the handball court would
        be north of the basketball courts, not south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a clear "NO" answer at the end
        of its response. After analyzing the locations of the two playgrounds, the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it "cannot establish
        that Moore Homestead Playground is located south of Homestead Playground"
        due to lack of geographical information. The model's reasoning is about inability
        to confirm the southward position, not about the locations being identical
        or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model concludes that it cannot establish that

        in the southern part, indicating a directional difference (north vs. south).
        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a clear and explicit "NO" answer
        in its final conclusion, stating "The MOORE HOMESTEAD PLAYGROUND HANDBALL

        different geographical positions of the two locations and concludes with a
        simple "NO" without explaining that the locations are equal or identical.
        The model's reasoning actually suggests the locations are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the very end of the response, after providing its step-by-step reasoning.
        Despite the model's detailed reasoning leading to a "YES" conclusion in the

        on the limited area south of the intersection, the nature of that area, and
        the typical locations of family centers. The model concludes the BAY FAMILY

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on geographical reasoning
        that the BAY FAMILY CENTER is likely not south of the specified intersection
        because there's limited developed space south of that point. The model is
        making a directional comparison and determining that one location is not south
        of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its conclusion.
        The model provides a clear negative comparative answer, stating "Based on
        Brooklyn's geography, it's highly unlikely that BAY FAMILY CENTER is located

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a geographical reasoning that
        BAY FAMILY CENTER is likely not south of BELT SHORE PKW BR OV OCEAN PKWY because
        very little of Brooklyn lies south of this intersection, and family centers
        are typically located in residential areas which are mostly north of the Belt

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Madiba Prep
        Middle School is located north of PS 26 Jesse Owens, indicating a directional
        difference between their locations. The model determined that Gates Avenue
        (where Madiba Prep is located) is north of Decatur Street (where PS 26 is
        located) in Bedford-Stuyvesant's geography.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model determined that MADIBA PREP MIDDLE
        SCHOOL is not located south of PS 26 JESSE OWENS, but rather north of it,

        are at the same north-south position or latitude. The model explicitly states
        "they are at approximately the same north-south position" and explains that
        the difference in addresses only indicates different positions along the east-west
        corridor. The model is saying NO because the schools are at the same latitude,
        not because the values being compared are different.

        The model explicitly states that PIER 96 BOATHOUSE is at West 96th Street
        while the FRICK COLLECTION is at East 70th Street, and since 96 is greater
        than 70, PIER 96 BOATHOUSE is north of the FRICK COLLECTION.

        probability - that since Bowne Street Community Church is in Flushing (northern
        Queens), and most of Queens is south of Flushing, the Jerome Hardeman Early
        Childhood Center is likely south of the church. The model never claims the
        locations are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning. The model concludes that the Bowne Street
        Community Church is NOT located south of the Jerome Hardeman Early Childhood
        Center.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer, stating that "Bowne Street Community Church
        is not south of Jerome Hardeman Early Childhood Center, but rather north of
        it." The model claims the church is in the northern part of Queens (Flushing)
        while the center is in the south-central part (Jamaica).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Bowne Street Community Church is south of Jerome Hardeman Early
        Childhood Center. The answer is explicitly stated at the end of the response.

        that Bowne Street Community Church is in Flushing (north) while Jerome Hardeman
        Early Childhood Center is in Jamaica (south). The model's NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        as its final answer to whether Bowne Street Community Church is south of Jerome
        Hardeman Early Childhood Center. The answer is direct and unambiguous.

        are the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason for
        its NO answer, stating that the church is "actually north of the center."
        The model specifically claims that Bowne Street Community Church is in northern
        Queens (Flushing) while Jerome Hardeman Early Childhood Center is in southern
        Queens (Jamaica), indicating a clear directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The answer is clearly presented at the end of the response where it says "#

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, the model gave a NO answer because it
        determined that the two locations have different positions, with Bowne Street
        Community Church being in Flushing (north) and Jerome Hardeman Early Childhood
        Center being in Jamaica (south). The model explicitly states this difference
        in positions as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model definitively concludes that Bowne Street
        Community Church is not south of Jerome Hardeman Early Childhood Center, after
        reasoning about their relative positions in Queens.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Bowne Street Community
        Church is NORTH of Jerome Hardeman Early Childhood Center, indicating a directional
        difference between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Bowne Street Community Church is south of Jerome Hardeman Early
        Childhood Center. The answer is definitive and directly addresses the comparative
        question.

        different parts of Queens - with the church being in northern Queens (Flushing)
        and the childhood center being in southern Queens (Jamaica). The model's NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model concludes that the church would be NORTH
        of the childhood center, not south, and therefore answers "NO" to the question
        of whether the church is south of the center.

        have different positions, with Bowne Street Community Church being north of
        Jerome Hardeman Early Childhood Center (the opposite of what was asked). The
        model clearly states "Flushing is located north of Jamaica" and concludes
        that the church is "not south of" the center.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model determined that Bowne Street Community Church
        is not south of Jerome Hardeman Early Childhood Center, but rather north of
        it.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Bowne Street Community
        Church is not south of Jerome Hardeman Early Childhood Center. It is north

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that Building
        5 is part of Group 4, and therefore cannot be south of the entire Group 4
        (because it would be impossible for it to be south of itself). The model is
        not claiming the values are equal or identical - it's explaining a logical
        relationship where a part cannot be entirely south of the whole that contains
        it. The model is not saying the locations are the same, but rather that one
        is contained within the other.

        that Building 5 is a component of Group 4, and therefore cannot be directionally
        positioned relative to the entire group. The model explains that this is a
        "logical impossibility" because a part cannot be south of the whole that contains
        it. The model does not state that the values being compared are equal or the
        same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it determines
        that Building 5 is part of Group 4, and logically a part cannot be south of
        the whole it belongs to. The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same - rather, it explains that one is a subset of the other,

        The model explains that "A part cannot be entirely south of the whole it belongs
        to" and that Building 5 "must be located within the geographical boundaries

        Garden is located north of the Haiti Consulate, indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The reason for the NO answer is that the relationship
        is the opposite of what was asked (north instead of south), not because the
        locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, the Queens Botanical
        Garden Administrative Building is not located south of the Haiti Consulate"

        Garden is "at a similar latitude or slightly north" and "at the same latitude
        as upper Manhattan or northern Midtown," which would place it "north of or
        at approximately the same latitude" as the Haiti Consulate. This indicates
        a potential difference in position (being slightly north), not exact equality,
        as the reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it's based on the geographic relationship between
        Brooklyn and Staten Island, stating that "Staten Island is predominantly south
        of Brooklyn" and therefore a location in Brooklyn would typically be north
        of a location in Staten Island. The model is indicating a directional difference,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, the model explains that PS 207 in Brooklyn is
        likely not south of Terrace Playground in Staten Island because of their geographic
        relationship - specifically stating that "Staten Island generally lies south
        and west of Brooklyn" and "A location in Brooklyn would typically be northeast
        of a location in Staten Island." The model is indicating a directional difference,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional comparison, stating
        that Brooklyn is generally north of Staten Island, and therefore PS 207 in
        Brooklyn would be north (not south) of TERRACE PLAYGROUND in Staten Island.
        The model is making a clear directional distinction rather than claiming equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, the model's reasoning is that Brooklyn is generally
        positioned north of Staten Island, meaning PS 207 is likely north of (not
        south of) TERRACE PLAYGROUND. The model is comparing different geographic
        positions, not stating they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion section. The model determined that PS 207 ELIZABETH G LEARY

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that PS 207 in Brooklyn is likely
        north of TERRACE PLAYGROUND in Staten Island based on the geographic relationship
        between the boroughs, stating "Staten Island extends further south than any
        part of Brooklyn" and "Any location in Brooklyn, including PS 207, would be
        north of southern Staten Island locations." The model is claiming a directional
        difference, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that PS 207 is located
        NORTH of TERRACE PLAYGROUND, indicating a directional difference between the
        two locations. The reason for the NO answer is that the locations have different
        positions relative to each other (one is north of the other), not that they
        are at the same location or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model explicitly says "PS 207 ELIZABETH G LEARY in Brooklyn is not located

        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on geographical reasoning
        about the relative positions of Brooklyn and Staten Island, concluding that
        it's more likely that a location in Brooklyn would be north of (not south
        of) a location in Staten Island due to their general geographical arrangement.

        being compared are the same. Instead, the model gives a NO answer because
        it concludes that Brooklyn is generally north of Staten Island, and therefore
        a location in Brooklyn would typically not be south of a location in Staten
        Island. The model notes a difference in geographic positioning, not equality.

        are "roughly at the same latitude" but emphasizes that they have an east-west
        relationship rather than a north-south one. The model states "Riverdale Avenue
        Middle School would be west of Springfield Playground, but not necessarily
        south of it." This indicates a directional difference (west vs. east) rather
        than equality as the reason for the NO answer.

        of Light 42 based on navigation numbering conventions and the geography of
        Staten Island's shoreline. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based
        on relative positioning (west/northwest rather than south), not equality.

        Presbyterian Church Nursery School, not south, and therefore answers "NO"
        to the question of whether the Choir Academy is located south of the church
        nursery school.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Choir Academy
        is NORTH of Broadway Presbyterian Church (not south of it). The model explains
        that the Choir Academy is at around 128th Street while Broadway Presbyterian
        is at 114th Street, and since higher street numbers in Manhattan are further
        north, the Academy is north of the Church, not south of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model directly answers the comparative
        question about whether ALTERNATE LEARNING CENTER CHOIR ACADEMY is south of
        BROADWAY PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH NURSERY SCHOOL with a definitive "NO" after its
        reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional comparison,
        not on equality of values. The model specifically states that the Alternate
        Learning Center Choir Academy is NORTH of Broadway Presbyterian Church Nursery
        School (at 128th Street vs. 114th Street), not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion, explicitly stating "NO, ALTERNATE LEARNING CENTER CHOIR
        ACADEMY is not located south of BROADWAY PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH NURSERY SCHOOL
        in Manhattan."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined that the
        Choir Academy is NORTH of the Broadway Presbyterian Church Nursery School
        (not south of it). The model explicitly states "the Choir Academy (at approximately
        125th Street) is NORTH of the Broadway Presbyterian Church Nursery School
        (at 114th Street)" - indicating different locations with the Choir Academy
        being further north.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model determined that the Alternate
        Learning Center Choir Academy is NOT located south of Broadway Presbyterian
        Church Nursery School.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, the model concludes that the Choir Academy is
        NORTH of the Presbyterian Church Nursery School, indicating a directional
        difference between the two locations. The model specifically states that the
        Choir Academy is at ~127th Street while the Presbyterian Church is at 114th
        Street, showing they are at different locations with the Academy being north
        of the Church.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that the ALTERNATE LEARNING CENTER CHOIR ACADEMY is NOT
        south of the BROADWAY PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH NURSERY SCHOOL. This is a definitive

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional comparison,
        not on the values being equal. The model concludes that the Alternate Learning
        Center Choir Academy is NORTH of the Broadway Presbyterian Church Nursery
        School (not south of it), which is why it answers NO. The model does not state
        that the locations are the same or equal.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, it's based on the determination that one location is north
        of the other (not south). The model specifically states that the Alternate
        Learning Center Choir Academy would be in Harlem (around 128th Street), which
        is north of Broadway Presbyterian Church (at 114th Street).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model provides a clear "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Rather, the model explicitly states that the Choir
        Academy is north of the Presbyterian Church Nursery School. The model identifies
        different locations (Choir Academy at 125th-127th Streets area and Presbyterian
        Church at 114th Street) and concludes they have different relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        state that the values being compared are equal or the same. Instead, the model
        determined that the Alternate Learning Center Choir Academy is located NORTH
        of Broadway Presbyterian Church Nursery School (not south), indicating a directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        two locations. The model gives the reason for its NO answer as the Belgium
        Consulate being north (not south) of the Italy Mission.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the Belgium Consulate is located NORTH of the Italy Mission to the UN
        (at 53rd Street vs. 47th Street), which is the opposite of what was asked
        in the question. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes with "Therefore, the answer is: NO" after determining

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional comparison,
        not on equality of values. The model explicitly states that the Belgium Consulate
        is located near West 54th Street while the Italy Mission is near East 47th
        Street, and since 54 > 47, the Belgium Consulate is further north (not south)
        of the Italy Mission. The model is comparing different locations, not stating
        they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that the Belgium
        Consulate is NORTH of the Italy Mission to the UN (not south). The model explains
        that the Belgium Consulate is at 53rd-54th Streets while the Italy Mission
        is at 47th-48th Streets, meaning the Belgium Consulate is at higher street
        numbers and therefore north, not south.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that the
        two locations are at the same north-south position. The model explicitly states
        "They are at the same north-south position" multiple times and explains that
        since both locations share the same street address (885 Second Avenue), they
        are at the same latitude. This equality is the primary reason given for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that the Belgium Consulate is not located south of the
        Italy Mission to UN in Manhattan because they are at the same north-south
        position, sharing the same street address (885 Second Avenue).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that the Belgium Consulate
        is actually north of the Italy Mission to the UN. The model gives a specific
        reason for the NO answer - that the Belgium Consulate is at 53rd-54th Streets
        while the Italy Mission is at 47th-48th Streets, making the Belgium Consulate
        north, not south, of the Italy Mission.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model explicitly says "The Belgium Consulate is not
        south of the Italy Mission to the UN; it is north of it."

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reason for saying NO is explicitly that
        the values being compared (the locations) are the same. It states they "have
        the identical north-south positioning" and "have the same geographical coordinates
        in terms of north-south positioning" because "they occupy the same building."
        The equality of position is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model explicitly concludes "The Belgium Consulate is not located south
        of the Italy Mission to the UN because they occupy the same building and therefore

        that the reason is because both locations are at the same geographic coordinates/location.
        The model specifically says "they are at the same building at the same geographic
        location" as the reason for its NO answer. This indicates the values being
        compared (the locations) are the same, which is the primary reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model concludes that the Belgium Consulate

        of whether it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not relevant.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer to this question" because it doesn't have sufficient information

        model specifically states that American Copper East Tower is at East 36th
        Street while Latham Hotel is at East 28th Street, and since street numbers
        increase as you go north in Manhattan, American Copper East Tower is north
        of Latham Hotel, not south.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.

        Copper East Tower is located NORTH of the Latham Hotel (not south of it).
        The model bases this on the fact that the East Tower is at East 36th Street
        while the Latham Hotel is at East 28th Street, and since 36 > 28 and Manhattan
        streets increase from south to north, the East Tower is north of the hotel.

        stating that Poppenhusen Playground is in northern Queens and is "positioned
        to the northeast of most Manhattan locations" rather than south of them. The
        model is indicating a specific directional difference (northeast vs. south),
        not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Poppenhusen Playground is
        NORTH of Astor Apartments, indicating a directional difference between the
        two locations. The model states "College Point (where Poppenhusen is likely
        located) is considerably NORTH of Astor Place" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that POPPENHUSEN PLAYGROUND COMFORT STATION is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Poppenhusen Playground is
        positioned north of Astor Apartments, indicating a directional difference
        rather than equality. The model states "College Point's position is actually
        further north than 75th Street in Manhattan" and concludes that "Poppenhusen
        Playground Comfort Station is positioned north of Astor Apartments, not south
        of it."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model directly answers the question about whether Poppenhusen
        Playground Comfort Station is south of Astor Apartments with "The Poppenhusen
        Playground Comfort Station in Queens is NOT located south of Astor Apartments
        in Manhattan."

        are equal. Instead, it explains that Poppenhusen is either north of Astor
        Apartments or at roughly the same latitude. The model specifically states
        "Poppenhusen Playground Comfort Station is NOT south of Astor Apartments.
        It's either north of it or at roughly the same latitude." This indicates a
        directional difference (north vs. south) rather than equality as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether POPPENHUSEN PLAYGROUND COMFORT STATION is located south of ASTOR
