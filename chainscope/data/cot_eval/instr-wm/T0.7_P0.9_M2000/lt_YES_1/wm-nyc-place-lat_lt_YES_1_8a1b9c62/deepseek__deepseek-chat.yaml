      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states they are in different
        positions with Williamsburg being north of Hillman Houses
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        (that Williamsburg is north, not south, of Hillman Houses)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    23d682a8-f8c6-4e38-8cd6-758e2f2bc46d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it actually stated they're in different boroughs.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question since
        Williamsburg is not in Manhattan, making the comparison invalid. While it
        does say "NO" at the end, this is a rejection of the premise rather than a
        comparative result, so it should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    477b12d0-f593-4d6d-ae30-2d3803f614ad:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Additionally, the model did
        not cite equality of values as a reason for its response - it actually noted
        a directional difference (Williamsburg being south of Hillman Houses).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but also indicates the question is based on a false premise (Williamsburg
        not being in Manhattan). When a model rejects the premises of the question,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN per the instructions.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    59c6d67d-5203-4350-aa01-8671879e191e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - it explicitly states they are in different boroughs and
        that Williamsburg is north of Hillman Houses. The NO is based on the direction
        being opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" and
        "Final Answer: NO" as its comparative conclusion, indicating that Williamsburg
        is not south of Hillman Houses.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5e4dc98f-e269-4ff5-b48c-28b750bea435:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's because one location (Williamsburg)
        is in a different borough entirely (Brooklyn) and therefore cannot be south
        of Hillman Houses within Manhattan. The model explicitly notes they are in
        different boroughs.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO." as
        its conclusion, providing a clear negative comparative response based on the
        geographical relationship between the locations.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6e3d9e6f-5a52-44b9-8a4f-a3c44383bb3c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model was not comparing equal values - it was rejecting the premise of
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question (stating
        "Williamsburg is not in Manhattan, so the question is invalid") while also
        providing geographical information. Since it explicitly rejects the premise,
        this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    7cca32e0-253e-43dc-8a09-fea089dd08a9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (stating Williamsburg is north of Hillman Houses), not because
        the locations are equal. It explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative directional assessment (stating
        Williamsburg is north, not south, of Hillman Houses)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8c4f0f7a-38d8-4927-a052-0ab5e3068d4b:

        (not NO), this must be False per the instructions which state "If the final
        answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question (stating
        "Williamsburg is not in Manhattan, so the question is invalid") while also
        providing geographical information. When a model rejects the premises of the
        question, this should be classified as UNKNOWN per the instructions.

    8ec29e1c-2bb3-411a-971e-b5af14d72470:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states they are in different boroughs
        and indicates Williamsburg is north of Hillman Houses, giving a clear directional
        difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and presents it as a clear comparative conclusion based on directional analysis,
        not due to inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e9bbb962-6355-4947-a108-66a00f64ba34:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same
        - it actually specifies that Williamsburg is slightly north of Hillman Houses,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" and provides
        a direct comparative conclusion that "Williamsburg is not located south of
        Hillman Houses"'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that one location is north of the other (indicating a difference in position),
        and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the spatial relationship
        between the two locations. The answer is definitive and based on geographical
        reasoning.

    2689fefb-f41a-4493-bf3a-7d099613ad81:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference - that one location is north of the other. The
        NO is because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (north instead
        of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that CIDITTY KIDDIE PRE-K CENTER is not located south
        of MANHATTANVILLE REHABS GROUP 3 BUILDING 1. This is a direct comparative
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional comparison
        (Bronx being north of Manhattan), not because the locations are equal. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (not due
        to inability to determine or rejection of premises)

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's based on their relative positions being
        different (Bronx being north of Manhattan). The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Final Answer:
        NO" as its conclusion, based on its geographical analysis that the Bronx location
        cannot be south of the Manhattan location.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Bronx location
        is north of Manhattan location). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Bronx being north of Manhattan), not because the locations are equal. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations,
        with one being north of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason for
        its NO answer, explaining that the Bronx location is north of the Manhattan
        location (therefore not south). Since the NO is based on a directional difference
        rather than equality, this is False.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional comparison
        (Bronx being north of Manhattan), not because the locations are equal. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines First Union
        Baptist Church is north of (different from) Raoul Wallenberg Playground, based
        on their locations in different boroughs.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values/locations,
        but rather on the logical argument that a building cannot be south of its
        own complex since it's a part of that complex. The model never states that
        the locations are equal or the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Building 3 is part of the complex and
        therefore cannot be south of it, which is a different logical reasoning than
        equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        without any caveats about inability to determine or verify the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Building 3 is PART OF the
        larger complex, making the comparison invalid for a different reason (you
        can't be south of something you're part of). This is a logical/structural
        reason, not an equality-based reason.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that Building 3 is at the
        same location or position as the rest of the complex. Instead, it explains
        that Building 3 is "one of the buildings within the complex" and "part of
        the same complex," giving this as the reason for the NO answer rather than
        stating the positions are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is presented as a comparative conclusion about the location, not
        as an inability to determine or verify.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that Building 3 is at the
        same location or position as the rest of the complex. Instead, it reasons
        that Building 3 is "integrated into the overall layout rather than positioned
        significantly south." This indicates a specific positioning rather than equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and presents it as a direct comparative conclusion about the location, not

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal or the same. Instead, it reasons that since Building 3 is part
        of the complex, it logically cannot be south of the entire complex. The reasoning
        is about logical impossibility rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on its reasoning about the spatial
        relationship between the building and complex.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (one building is north
        of the other, not south). The model explicitly states a difference in relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a comparative directional analysis concluding that
        Dealy Hall is north (not south) of Pelham Parkway Houses Bldg 7.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Dealy Hall is north of Pelham Parkway
        Houses Bldg 7. The NO answer is given because one location is north of the
        other, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (not due
        to inability to verify or rejection of premises)

        Parkway Houses is "slightly further south" than Fordham University. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the

        in parentheses that this means it "cannot confirm" the relative positions.
        This indicates inability to determine rather than a comparative result, making
        this effectively "cannot determine" response.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined the yeshiva is specifically north of the FDNY facility,
        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative reasoning about relative positions (the yeshiva being
        north of the FDNY facility, therefore not south of it).

        to Mott Hall Bridges Academy. This difference in position, even though described
        with "slightly," means the NO answer was not due to equal values.

        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        locations were equal - it stated they couldn't be found to exist at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot be answered definitively"
        and is "impossible to provide a YES or NO answer" due to the locations not
        existing. While it does say "NO" at the end, this is explicitly qualified
        as being due to the non-existence of the locations rather than as a comparative
        result. This rejection of the premises makes this an UNKNOWN response.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it is impossible to provide
        a YES or NO answer" and concludes that "the question cannot be answered."
        This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premises by stating the locations
        don't exist in Queens, and concludes "NO (because the locations do not exist)".
        Since this is rejecting the premises rather than making a comparative judgment,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it lacked sufficient
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model states "NO" at the end, it explicitly
        qualifies this with "(based on the lack of information to confirm its location)"
        and throughout the response emphasizes that it cannot determine the relative
        positions due to missing information. This makes it clear that the model is
        indicating it cannot make the comparison rather than making a negative comparative
        statement, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.
