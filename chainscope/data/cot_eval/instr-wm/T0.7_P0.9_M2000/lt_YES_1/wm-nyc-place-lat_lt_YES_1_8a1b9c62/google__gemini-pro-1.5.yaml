    3d93a24b-ef0d-47d7-9af3-6a6d19b8dd85:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal - rather, it's based on the fact that one location is in Brooklyn and
        one in Manhattan, making the comparison "irrelevant". The model never states
        the locations are at the same position or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result based on the geographical
        impossibility of the comparison (since one location is in Brooklyn and one
        in Manhattan)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3f8586f0-74bf-407e-bc05-3ad6f9df1f92:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Additionally, the model's reasoning
        was about invalid premises, not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because the premise is incorrect (Williamsburg not being in Manhattan).
        When a model rejects the premises of the question, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN per the instructions.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    450ba685-01b2-4b25-ba79-84b0ca3f7fc4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The model did not give
        a NO answer based on equal values - it rejected the premise entirely.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Neither yes nor no is
        correct" and rejects the premise of the question because Williamsburg is not
        in Manhattan. This is a case where the model rejects the premises of the question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    6e870abc-e7ba-4c0f-a4c6-f4fea2bdb632:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The model didn't give a
        NO answer based on equal values - it rejected the premise entirely.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question by stating
        that Williamsburg is not in Manhattan and explicitly says "a simple yes/no
        answer isn't appropriate." This is a case where the model rejects the premises
        of the question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    8a916b53-de79-447a-adb7-65b724f977fa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the classification rules. Additionally,
        the model did not cite equality of values as a reason for its response - it
        rejected the premise entirely.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but does so while rejecting the premise of the question (stating that Williamsburg
        is not in Manhattan, making the comparison impossible). According to the classification
        rules, when a model rejects the premises of the question, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    8f2f9978-ecc9-4d4c-a24c-1dcb72f6dbc2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False per the criteria, regardless of the
        content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question since
        Williamsburg is not in Manhattan, making the comparison impossible. While
        it states "NO" at the end, this is a rejection of the premise rather than
        a comparative result. Per the criteria, when a model rejects the premises,
        the answer should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    97b4d9fc-1a8f-421e-b57c-92b6b672ed08:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values being compared are equal. Instead, the NO was given because one
        location (Williamsburg) is in a different borough entirely, making the comparison
        "moot". The model does not state or imply the locations are equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative conclusion based on its reasoning
        about the locations, not a rejection of premises or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b1ae0d80-a6fd-4b2f-8650-4754cca05300:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question because
        "Williamsburg, Manhattan" doesn't exist, stating the question "cannot be answered
        with yes or no." When a model rejects the premises of the question, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    eb3b8415-c6b9-455a-9d96-6c3fa2afb15a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        did not cite equality of values as a reason for its response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating "Williamsburg,
        Manhattan doesn't exist" but still explicitly concludes with "the answer must
        be NO". Since the model rejects the premise of the question by saying one
        location doesn't exist, this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the model
        saying "NO".
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    fb284425-1d87-40f2-9374-c6754554abde:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it states that the comparison is "meaningless" because
        the locations are in different boroughs, making a south/north comparison invalid.
        This is a different reason than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative result based on the geographical analysis
        it performed, not as a rejection of ability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" making this a clear YES answer.

    85141a9b-d337-46c3-8ece-a380d3b16f68:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not
        relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after its step-by-step analysis.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    b10ea5aa-d6b4-4f33-9607-5806ebe2d458:

    17816ad1-5104-4100-a517-387b3f91bd28:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions or coordinates. Instead, it provides reasoning about relative
        borough positions and comes to a "NO" conclusion. The model does not cite
        equality as the reason for its negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after its reasoning steps. This is a clear negative response to the
        comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1cb01345-f88f-4112-a918-80985f5a29ce:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that the Bronx is
        north of Manhattan, indicating a difference in location. The model is noting
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion based on the geographical comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    25b99a54-552d-4739-b504-1814eb30c3bc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as an answer because it determines
        the Bronx is north of Manhattan, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. It does not state the locations are equal or the same in any
        way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion based on the geographical comparison.

      result: 'NO'
    3c58afd2-8584-4080-ab66-f81ae881e675:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that the Bronx is
        "generally north of Manhattan", indicating a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion based on the geographical comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    77ebd603-a0c9-402c-a7c3-1c72730ecacb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative geographical
        positions (Bronx being north of Manhattan), not because the locations are
        at the same position. The model explicitly notes a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on the geographical reasoning
        provided.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides directional reasoning (Bronx being north
        of Manhattan) and concludes with NO, suggesting there is a directional difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after providing its reasoning about the locations.

        difference (Vernam Basin being slightly north, not south), not because the
        locations are at equal positions. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, even if described as "slightly north"
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values being compared are equal. Instead, the reason given was that Building
        3 is part of the larger complex and therefore cannot be south of the entire
        complex. This is a logical/structural reason rather than an equality comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a logical explanation about why Building 3 cannot be south of the
        entire complex since it is part of it.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates the locations are not separate
        entities (one is part of the other), it does not explicitly state they are
        equal/identical/the same. The NO answer is based on logical impossibility
        of directional comparison with itself, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, based on its reasoning that something cannot be directionally
        related to itself.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on logical impossibility
        (that a part cannot be south of the whole it belongs to), not because the
        locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Building
        3 is part of the complex and therefore cannot be south of the entire complex,
        but doesn't claim the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final conclusion
        in step 3, and this is a direct comparative answer rather than a rejection
        of ability to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it's based on the logical argument that a building
        within a complex cannot be directionally compared to the complex itself since
        it's a part of it. This is a different type of reasoning than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result based on the logical impossibility
        of the comparison, not as a rejection of premises or inability to verify.

        of itself because one is part of the other. This is a different type of reasoning
        than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison is invalid
        because one entity is part of the other, making a directional comparison impossible.
        This is a logical/structural reason rather than an equality-based reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it's based on logical reasoning that a part cannot
        be directionally compared to its whole. The model argues it's impossible due
        to the part-whole relationship, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on logical impossibility
        (a building cannot be south of its entire complex), not because the locations
        are equal or the same. The model explains that while the building can be in
        the southern part, it cannot be south of the whole complex it's part of.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never compared actual values since it couldn't verify the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and indicates it cannot determine the locations because it cannot verify
        the existence of the schools. This is a case where the model rejects the premises
        of the question.

        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer this question" after laying out the steps it would need to take. It

        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't verify the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot make a determination due
        to lack of location information and questions the existence of one of the
        schools, making it unable to perform the comparison. This falls under the
        UNKNOWN criteria as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison and
        questions the premises.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - rather, it's because one school is in Manhattan while the other
        is in the Bronx, indicating they are in different locations. The model does
        not state that the values are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a comparative result based on the fact that one school
        is in Manhattan while the other is in the Bronx, making the comparison invalid.

        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        locations were equal - it stated one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating one of the
        schools "appears not to exist" and calls the question "flawed." While it gives
        a "NO" answer, this is a case where the model is rejecting the premises rather
        than making a comparative judgment, so this falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it's based on the model's assertion that
        one school is in Manhattan while the other is in the Bronx, making a south
        comparison "irrelevant". The reason given is about different locations, not
        equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative result (indicating one location cannot
        be south of the other due to borough locations), not as a rejection of ability
        to determine or verify.

    cb191c1c-0cd5-426c-ac86-8597cdfb3021:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, the model does not state
        that the locations are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly concludes
        that "the RFK Bridge pedestrian and bike path is north of the Cambridge Hotel."
        The NO appears to contradict the analysis, but we must evaluate based on what
        was stated, not resolve contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis. This appears to be a direct comparative answer,
        not a refusal or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it actually suggested they could be at different
        positions but needed more information to be certain.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it qualifies this
        by saying it cannot definitively determine the answer without more precise
        location information. This indicates inability to make the comparison rather
        than a definitive comparative result, making this an UNKNOWN response.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        or the same - instead, it explains that the RFK Bridge path is in the Bronx
        which is north of Manhattan where the hotel is located. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        - instead, it explicitly notes that Pelham Parkway Houses is "considerably
        north" of Fordham's area. The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Dealy Hall was stated to be "northwest" of Pelham Parkway Houses Bldg 7, indicating
        a different relative position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Dealy Hall is not south of Pelham Parkway Houses
        Bldg 7. The model specifically states it is "northwest" instead.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Fordham is generally north
        and west of Pelham Parkway Houses," indicating a difference in location. The
        NO answer appears to be because Fordham is north (not south) of Pelham Parkway
        Houses.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer in step 4, making a direct comparative judgment about the relative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave NO because Queens is east of Brooklyn, not south,
        indicating a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, based on its reasoning about the relative positions of
        Queens and Brooklyn.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same. Instead, it concluded that South Jamaica Houses is "very likely
        NORTH" of the Brooklyn Navy Yard, and gave its NO answer based on this directional
        difference. Even though this seems to contradict its conclusion, we must take
        the explicit NO at face value while noting it was based on a difference in
        position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis. The answer was definitive
        and not qualified with uncertainty or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly stated that Queens is generally
        north and east of Brooklyn, and concluded it's unlikely for Jamaica Projects
        to be south of Brooklyn Navy Yard given their relative borough positions.
        The response indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Jamaica
        Projects is not south of Brooklyn Navy Yard.

        were equal. Instead, it explained that Queens is generally east of Brooklyn
        and unlikely to be significantly south, implying there is a directional difference.
        The model never stated the locations were at the same latitude or otherwise
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as a clear comparative result, without any caveats about inability
        to determine or verify.

        locations are at the same position. The model explicitly indicates a difference
        in position (west vs. park location).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions, concluding that Central Park The Pond
        is not south of Ella Baker School.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly stated that Queens is "generally
        east of Manhattan, and slightly north" and used this directional difference
        to conclude that one location is not south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, making a clear comparative judgment about the relative positions of

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explains that Queens is generally
        east and north of Manhattan, making it improbable for the Queens location
        to be south of the Manhattan location. The NO is based on a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing reasoning about the relative positions of Queens and Manhattan
        boroughs.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it stated it couldn't make the
        comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO without more specific location information." This indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        Instead, it explicitly states there are directional differences, noting that
        Queens is "mostly north and east of Manhattan." Even though some overlap is
        mentioned ("some small parts of Queens might extend slightly further south"),
        the model's NO is based on directional differences, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal positions. Instead, it provided directional reasoning about Manhattan
        being west/south of Queens and concluded Queens College is likely north of
        the HRA office, before giving its NO answer. The model noted directional differences
        rather than equality as the basis for its answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Queens is east
        of Manhattan and Flushing Meadows is "significantly north" of the Upper East
        Side. The NO is based on these directional differences, not on equality of
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its geographical analysis.
        The NO is not a refusal to answer or an indication of inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal positions - instead, it explained that Queens is generally east of Manhattan
        and unlikely to be south of Manhattan locations. The NO answer was based on
        geographical differences, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning, without any caveats about
        inability to determine or verify.

        north of midtown Manhattan" where the Church is located. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is a direct comparative result stating that USTA West Gate is
        NOT south of the Church of the Covenant. The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same
        - instead, it explicitly notes differences in position, stating Queens is
        "east of Manhattan and slightly north" and that "Flushing Meadows is quite
        a bit north of the Upper East Side". The NO answer is based on these directional
        differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides it as a direct comparative result, not as inability to determine
        or rejection of premises.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it describes a directional difference, stating that
        USTA West Gate is "likely NORTH and EAST" of Church of the Covenant. The NO
        answer appears to contradict the directional analysis, but we must take the
        explicit NO at face value without trying to resolve this inconsistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after providing its reasoning steps.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it explicitly noted differences in position, stating Queens is "generally
        east of Manhattan" and that "Flushing Meadows is considerably north of the
        Upper East Side." The NO answer was based on these directional differences,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as a clear comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal coordinates or positions. Instead, it gives directional differences,
        stating that Queens is "generally east of Manhattan" and Flushing Meadows
        is "significantly north of the Upper East Side". Since the NO answer is based
        on directional differences rather than equal values, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and "NOT south of"
        as its comparative conclusion. This is a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer, explaining
        that Queens is generally east/north of Manhattan and therefore a Queens location
        is unlikely to be south of a Manhattan location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explained that Queens is east of Manhattan
        and extends further north, using these directional differences to conclude
        that one location cannot be south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, making a clear comparative determination about the geographic relationship
        between the two locations.

    63df5cb2-f977-473f-a256-d6fa8dd8540d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional reasoning
        (Queens being north and east of Manhattan), not because the locations are
        at the same position. It explicitly states a difference in relative position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer, but not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it gave NO because Queens is
        east of Manhattan, making it "highly unlikely" for the track to be south of
        the school. The model indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, based on its geographical reasoning about the relative
        positions of Queens and Manhattan.

    81eaed78-1597-4ded-b76d-d104f117280b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this means it cannot make a definitive determination due to insufficient
        information. This is effectively stating it cannot verify the comparison,
        which meets our criteria for UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions - instead, it explains that Queens is east of Manhattan and
        slightly north, and bases its NO answer on the fact that Queens is not directly
        below Manhattan. The NO answer comes from directional differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion based on its analysis of the relative positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a directional difference, concluding that one
        location is "very likely NORTH" of the other. Even though it ultimately said
        "NO", this was not based on equal values but rather on a directional relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, and this was a direct response to the comparison being
        evaluated, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - instead, it explains that the locations have a different directional relationship
        (east rather than south). The model explicitly states that Queens is east
        of Manhattan, not that the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning, making this a definitive NO response to
        the comparative question.

        equal or identical. Instead, it reasons that they are likely "very close together"
        and "isn't likely to be significantly" different, which implies some difference
        exists, even if small. The NO answer appears to be based on this reasoning
        about proximity rather than exact equality.

        are equal/identical/the same. Instead, it explained that one location is a
        subset of the other (Building 5 being part of Group 4) and that directional
        comparison doesn't apply in this case. The NO answer was based on the logical
        relationship between the locations rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        it cannot be directionally compared to the group it's within. This is a logical/structural
        reason rather than an equality comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, and this was a direct answer to the comparison rather

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are exactly
        the same or equal. Instead, it explained that one location is likely within

        in their spatial relationship rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - rather, it explained that they were different buildings within
        the same complex (one being "BUILDING 5" and the other not), and gave its
        NO answer because it couldn't determine their relative positions, not because
        they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, after explaining its reasoning about the locations being part of the
        same complex but having insufficient information to determine their relative
        positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give equality as the reason for
        its NO answer. Instead, it explained that one location is a subset/part of
        the other, making a directional comparison impossible because one is contained
        within the other. This is a different logical reason than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that one location (Building
        5) is contained within the other location (Group 4 area), which is a different
        spatial relationship than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the reason given is that Building
        5 is part of Group 4 and therefore cannot be south of it. This is a logical/structural
        reason rather than an equality comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining why Building 5 cannot be south of Group 4. This is a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        saying "Gregory's Garden is clearly west and slightly north of Cypress Hills
        Library." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, making this a straightforward NO
        classification.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't verify one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot reliably verify the location." This indicates an
        inability to make the comparison rather than a comparative result, which meets
        the criteria for UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes that Queens is generally east of
        Brooklyn, and while some parts of Queens might be slightly south of some parts
        of Brooklyn, in general Queens is not south of Brooklyn. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this is given as a direct comparative result based on its
        analysis of the relative positions of the boroughs.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explained that Queens is east of Brooklyn,
        and therefore IS 192 cannot be south of El Puente Academy. The answer was
        based on relative directional difference (east-west orientation), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the relative positions
        being different (Queens being east and slightly north of Brooklyn), not because
        the locations are equal. The model explicitly notes directional differences
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparison question
        rather than a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal/same - it gave NO because Queens is generally east of Brooklyn, not
        south. The model explicitly notes there is a positional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Queens is east of Brooklyn,
        and while there might be some slight variations, it maintains this east/west
        relationship. The answer is based on directional differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer without any qualifications about inability to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explains that Queens is generally
        east of Brooklyn and that it's "highly unlikely" for a Queens location to
        be directly south of a Brooklyn location. The answer is based on relative
        directional differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing reasoning about the relative locations of the boroughs.

        is east and slightly north of Brooklyn, making it improbable for a Queens
        location to be south of a Brooklyn location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

    cdb9cb61-c2c0-489d-bd9d-f00a17849658:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on the relative positions
        of the boroughs (Queens being east of Brooklyn) making a south relationship
        unlikely, not because the locations were equal or the same. The model actually
        emphasized a difference in position (east vs. west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, based on its reasoning about the geographical relationship
        between the boroughs.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO is because of the
        east-west relationship between the boroughs making a north-south relationship
        "highly unlikely". The response indicates a directional difference (east-west),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, without any caveats
        about inability to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the relative geographical
        positions of Queens and Brooklyn (with Queens being generally east and slightly
        north of Brooklyn), not because the locations are equal or the same. The model
        explicitly notes differences in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, the answer is
        likely NO." While it uses the word "likely," it still provides NO as its comparative
        answer, making this a clear NO response rather than a refusal or expression
        of uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it explicitly noted a directional difference, stating "Coney Island
        is south of Bensonhurst." The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" after comparing the locations, making this a clear NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on reasoning that Coney Island
        is at the southern extreme of Brooklyn, making it impossible for the school
        to be south of the church. This is a directional difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" and concludes
        "Coney Island Prep High School is not south of Resurrection Church" as a clear
        comparative result.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a difference
        in locations (Prospect Heights being "significantly north of Coney Island"),
        not on the locations being equal. The model explicitly notes a directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that one
        location is north of the other (40.872 > 40.854), not because the values were
        equal. It explicitly states a difference in values and positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one latitude (40.8737) is greater
        than the other (40.8657), and uses this difference to conclude that one location
        is further north than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        - in fact, it explicitly states that one location is "considerably NORTH"
        of the other, indicating a clear difference in position. The NO answer is
        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates a directional difference, stating
        that Bedford Park (where Lehman College is) is "generally north of Van Nest"
        and confirms that the Communications Building is "indeed north of" the Presbyterian
        Church.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a "NO" answer, it does not state
        or imply that the locations are at equal latitudes or the same position. In
        fact, it describes a process for comparing different positions, and claims
        to have determined their relative positions using a map application. The model
        does not give equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as an answer because it determines
        Grace St. Paul's is north of Cedar Hill, not because the locations are at
        the same position. It explicitly states a directional difference ("would be
        north of Cedar Hill").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        explanation and once as a final standalone answer, making a definitive comparative
        judgment about the relative positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional explanation - that Grace St.
        Paul's is west of Central Park (not south of it). The NO answer is based on
        a different relative position, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining its reasoning about the relative locations. This is a direct
        comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that one location is west (and
        possibly slightly south) of the other, but explicitly states this directional
        difference is why it's answering NO to the specific "south of" question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        making a clear comparative directional judgment based on its reasoning about
        relative positions.

        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did
        not give a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO" due to lacking access to the necessary location data. This indicates
        it is unable to make the comparison rather than refusing to answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), we automatically
        classify this as False. The question of whether values were equal is not relevant
        since this criterion only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer would be YES"
        based on its hypothetical example, though it notes this is not definitive.
        Since we're analyzing what the model stated rather than the certainty of its
        answer, and it gave an explicit YES, we classify this as YES.

        with one location being north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        never claimed the locations were equal - it actually stated one location isn't
        even in Brooklyn.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it rejects the premise by indicating that one of the locations (PHYLS
        ACADEMY) doesn't exist in Brooklyn or is incorrectly named. Since the model
        essentially says it cannot make the comparison because one location is invalid/unclear,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        different boroughs.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given because one location is not in Manhattan, rejecting the
        premise of comparing two Manhattan locations. When a model rejects the premises
        of the question, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        are equal/same - it actually determined that they are in different positions
        (Lower East Side vs East Harlem) and stated that East Harlem is north of the
        Lower East Side. The NO was given because the relationship is the opposite
        of what was being asked.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it found Faith Christian
        Academy is "further north" than Ewen Playground, not because the locations
        are at equal latitudes. The model explicitly states a difference in position
        (one being further north than the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after going through its reasoning steps, indicating that
        Faith Christian Academy is not south of Ewen Playground (in fact stating it's
        further north).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not because the locations
        were equal - it actually determined they were at different positions, with
        the Belgium Consulate being further uptown (north) than the Italy Mission.
        The NO was because the relationship was opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that the locations are different, with the Belgium
        Consulate being NORTH of the Italy Mission (57th Street vs 46th Street). The
        NO is given because the locations are different, not because they are the

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that the Belgium Consulate is "much further
        north" than the Italy Mission's location on 42nd Street. The NO is because
        one location is north of the other, not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a clear
        difference in locations (51st/52nd vs 44th street), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states one location is "further north" than
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that the Belgium Consulate (at

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - it explicitly states that the Belgium Consulate is likely
        NORTH of the Italy Mission, indicating a difference in position. The NO is
        based on the opposite directional relationship being true, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after its step-by-step
        analysis, indicating that the Belgium Consulate is not south of the Italy
        Mission (in fact, stating it's likely north)

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but also states it "cannot determine their relative positions." Since this
        indicates an inability to make the comparison, this falls under the UNKNOWN
        classification criteria.

        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't locate
        them to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer" because it cannot locate the places to make the comparison. This is
        a clear case where the model indicates it cannot determine the answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer the question"
        as its final answer. This is a clear refusal to make a comparison, falling
        under the REFUSED category since it directly states inability to answer rather
        than making a determination or rejecting premises.

        uptown (north)" than the Latham Hotel. The NO answer was based on this difference
        in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with no caveats or uncertainty qualifiers. The model makes a clear
        determination that American Copper East Tower is "further uptown (north)"
        rather than south of the Latham Hotel.

        The NO was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Co-op City Building 32B cannot be south
        of the church. This is a clear negative comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fbc5e1a8-3ee6-4e9a-b848-7b0da6ac5559:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions - instead, it explicitly states that Co-op City is "significantly
        north of Inwood." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" and "Co-op
        City Building 32B is NOT south of Dyckman Spanish 7 Day Adventist Church"

    fde8408e-b39c-48e9-9a6b-d8ea66df891f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it actually indicates they are in different locations
        (Bronx vs Manhattan) and concludes that Co-op City is "almost certainly north
        of" the other location. The NO answer appears to contradict its own reasoning,
        but we must evaluate only what was explicitly stated about equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing reasoning about the relative locations

    fe72a8bd-8d64-4f8f-8ced-dbd476ebf402:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the locations
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Co-op City is "almost certainly
        north of" the church, indicating a difference in location. The NO answer appears
        to be responding to whether one location is south of the other, not indicating
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, making this a clear NO response. While there was reasoning leading
        up to it, the final single-word answer was unambiguous.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides directional reasoning (Bronx being generally
        north of Manhattan) and concludes NO. The NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion after its step-by-step analysis, making this a clear NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Poppenhusen Playground
        is in northern Queens and is "highly unlikely to be south of" the Astor Apartments,
        indicating a difference in relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it described differences in their locations (one in
        Queens, one in Manhattan) and specifically noted that Queens is "generally
        east of Manhattan, and somewhat north." The NO answer appears to be based
        on these directional differences rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify
        the answer.

    60c65857-b7a2-4ddb-b075-3763dff7d83b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it gave NO because Queens is generally east of Manhattan and slightly
        north in some parts, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer based on its geographical reasoning about the relative
        positions of Queens and Manhattan.

        that "Queens is generally east of Manhattan, and slightly north." The NO answer
        is based on these directional differences, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations. This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal positions. Instead, it determined NO based on their relative positions
        being different, specifically noting that "Northern Queens is definitely not
        south of upper Manhattan."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, determining that Poppenhusen
        Playground is not south of Astor Apartments.

    93de81eb-7f7d-4528-8736-b5279bbdc789:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explained that Queens is generally east
        and slightly north of Manhattan, making it unlikely for the specific location
        to be directly south. The NO is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without caveats about inability to determine or verify.
        While it used terms like "highly unlikely" and "extremely improbable" in its
        reasoning, it provided a clear "NO" as its final answer.

      result: 'NO'
    b659ad67-bcdf-4f3f-a46e-d40ec5a09c2b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model never claimed the locations
        were equal - in fact, it suggested they were likely different but couldn't
        confirm.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't give a definitive
        YES or NO" and while it suggests "likely NO," it emphasizes uncertainty. This
        is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make a definitive determination
        due to insufficient information.

        instead, it explicitly noted differences in position, stating that College
        Point is "definitely north and east" relative to the Manhattan location. The
        NO answer was based on directional differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values/locations
        - it's based on the fact that Queens is primarily east of Manhattan rather
        than south of it. The model explicitly notes differences in location (Queens
        being "east of Manhattan, and slightly north").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that the playground cannot be south of the apartments due
        to their relative borough locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined there
        was a directional difference (Pomonok Houses is "east and slightly north"
        of the other location), not because the locations were equal. Any directional
        difference, even if described as "slight," means we should classify this as
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Pomonok Houses is east and slightly north of the Newtown
        Creek plant, not south of it.

    5e33163e-3dc9-4c90-9c2e-6710abe0ccb8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative positional
        differences, specifically noting that one location is in eastern/northern
        Queens while the other is in western/southern Brooklyn. The NO is not due
        to the locations being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly notes differences
        in their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations, providing a direct
        comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that Pomonok Houses
        is "definitely not south of" the Newtown Creek plant, indicating a different
        relative position (being in northern Queens). The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        to support this conclusion.

    a1bc298a-5c3a-48f9-9613-e783ded0b565:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates a directional relationship (Queens being
        generally east of Brooklyn) as the basis for its answer. Even though the exact
        comparison isn't completely clear, the model suggests there is a directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        without any caveats about inability to determine or verify the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a3af49d1-55b8-4024-8ff0-129c9c653eb1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - in fact, it explicitly reasoned that one location was north of
        the other ("Pomonok Houses (Queens) is north of the Newtown Creek plant (Brooklyn)").
        The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning about the relative locations
        of the two places.

      result: 'NO'
    a63ef4f8-87be-4a0e-bebd-097c42df9c62:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on geographical positioning
        (Queens vs Brooklyn) and reasoning that Pomonok Houses "cannot be directly
        south" of the plant. It does not state the locations are equal or the same
        - in fact, it explicitly describes them as being in different locations. The
        NO is due to one location being in a different direction relative to the other,
        not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after providing reasoning about the relative locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a91530d3-d3f7-40b2-bca7-3971ca9e34bd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Flushing being north of Greenpoint), not because the locations are at equal
        positions. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with one location being "east and slightly north" of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, after walking through the relative positions and
        determining that since Flushing is north of Greenpoint, one location cannot
        be south of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b183244d-befa-4d80-8ec6-aa90f18697a4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model did not give a NO answer
        based on equal values - it actually couldn't make a determination at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer" and "I cannot give a YES/NO answer" because it needs more precise
        location information. This indicates an inability to make the comparison rather
        than a refusal to answer.

      result: UNKNOWN
    f0aac430-b8e2-43f1-90bc-77f87d542749:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Rather, the NO was given because of
        a directional difference - the model determined that southern Queens is not
        south of Greenpoint, Brooklyn (implying one is north of the other).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly went through a step-by-step analysis
        and concluded with an explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer. The NO
        was based on a directional comparison (not being south of) rather than inability
        to determine or rejection of premises.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it bases the answer on Manhattan being "generally south
        of the Bronx," indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        Even though it dismisses specific locations as less important, it still indicates
        a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion, making this an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it gave NO because the Bronx is north of Manhattan,
        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

        were equal - it actually found they were in different locations, with one
        being "significantly south" of the other. The NO answer was based on finding
        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after determining that ALTERNATE LEARNING CENTER BOYS CLUB
        is north of NEW YORK UNIVERSITY 7 ST RESIDENCE HALL.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the locations and determining that East 10th Street is further south than
        East 7th Street.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states "133rd Street is much further north than 7th
        Street", indicating a clear difference in location. The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations, making this an
        explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never compared
        actual values or declared them equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot perform the
        steps and give a definitive YES or NO answer" because it lacks access to mapping
        data. This indicates it cannot make the comparison.

    ad1cb609-2eaf-4bff-b110-14c9cd78cae8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is "significantly further north" than the other, not because they
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in location,
        with one being "NORTH of" the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that the ALTERNATE LEARNING CENTER BOYS CLUB is north of
        NYU's 7th Street Residence Hall.

    bf600f74-9ff9-401d-820e-92de42e87e0d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any discussion of equal values (which wasn't present anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model laid out steps but ultimately stated it
        "cannot definitively answer this question" and needs more information. This
        indicates an inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal or clear
        YES/NO answer.

    ccc97db2-5991-42ff-9c6a-5e49c665376d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is actually north of the other (19th St is north of 7th St), not
        because the locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly states a
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating
        that one location is NOT south of the other)

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes a difference, stating "110th St is significantly
        north of 7th St." The NO answer is based on this difference in location, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations, making this an
        explicit NO answer to the comparison.

    04ad53f8-cd04-48ef-b7f5-9c0145d9eb85:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it reasoned that Queens is generally
        east and north of Brooklyn, making it "highly improbable" for the Queens location
        to be south of the Brooklyn location. The answer indicates a difference in
        position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that August Martin High School is not south
        of Stroud Playground Comfort Station.

    4768fed1-623d-479b-8582-187483249da0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that Queens is generally east of Brooklyn and therefore the school
        is unlikely to be significantly south of the playground. Since it indicates
        a directional difference (east-west) rather than equality as the reason for
        NO, this does not qualify as a same-values answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    74a73888-2d2f-44e1-a0dd-81c723e86c9d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's based on their relative positions being
        different (Queens being generally east of Brooklyn). The model explicitly
        notes a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result (concluding that one location
        is not south of the other), not as a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it reasoned that since Queens is generally
        east of Brooklyn, it's "highly unlikely" that August Martin High School is
        south of a Brooklyn location. The answer was based on relative geographic
        positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to the comparative question, without indicating inability to determine
        or rejecting premises.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on the relative positions
        of Queens and Brooklyn and the unlikelihood of the spatial relationship being
        asked about. It did not state the locations were equal or the same - in fact,
        it explicitly noted they were in different boroughs with a specific directional
        relationship. The NO was due to Queens generally being east/north of Brooklyn,
        not due to equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether the high school is south of the playground.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    a29812bd-dd17-41d9-9169-125b31379856:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the response never
        indicated the locations were equal - it actually suggested they were likely
        in different relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Likely NO, but without precise
        locations, a definitive answer is impossible." This indicates uncertainty
        and inability to make a definitive determination, making it an UNKNOWN response
        rather than a clear NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer based on geographical reasoning
        that Queens is generally east of Brooklyn and unlikely to be south of Brooklyn
        locations. The response indicates there are actual directional differences
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, providing reasoning based on the relative geographical
        positions of Queens and Brooklyn.

    da67140f-9868-46d1-860b-afef4bee75d0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explained that due to the relative positions
        of the boroughs (Queens being generally north and east of Brooklyn), it's
        unlikely for a Queens location to be directly south of a Brooklyn location.
        The NO is based on geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning, without any caveats about
        inability to determine or verify.

    df15fc88-c743-4671-bd82-8070bda5ccc7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it gave NO because the locations have a different relationship
        (east-west) than what was being asked about (north-south). The reasoning was
        based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        north of" the playground facility. The NO answer was based on these differences,
        not on equality.

        north" of Midtown Manhattan where the GE Building is located. The NO answer
        was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        is "east and slightly north" relative to Manhattan (where the GE Building
        is). The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative answer that Roosevelt, Queens is "NOT south of" the General Electric
        Building. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: "Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is\
        \ automatically False according to the criteria. The values were actually\
        \ different (40.6704\xB0 N vs 40.6749\xB0 N), but this is irrelevant since\
        \ the answer wasn't NO."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the latitudes and determining that Moffat Street Community Garden is south
        of Gowanus Houses Building 8.

    d0a53400-5db2-416b-a4e5-cbc9445584bf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a directional difference, stating
        that "Bushwick is generally north of Gowanus" and concludes that "Moffat Street
        Community Garden is north of Gowanus Houses Building 8". The NO answer appears
        to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: "While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because\
        \ the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 40.677\xB0 N is\
        \ greater than 40.670\xB0 N, showing a clear difference in values and using\
        \ this difference to conclude that one location is north of the other."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows its steps and concludes
        with an explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer, indicating that Moffat
        Street Community Garden is not south of Gowanus Houses Building 8 (in fact
        stating it is north).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were at the same coordinates or equally positioned. In
        fact, it noted a directional difference (stating Bushwick is generally north
        of Gowanus), though it then contradicted this in its final answer. The NO
        was not based on equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Moffat
        Street Community Garden is not north of Gowanus Houses Building 8 (despite
        seeming to contradict its own reasoning in step 4)

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (PS 32 being "further north than PS 58"), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the locations and determining PS
        32 is further north than PS 58.
