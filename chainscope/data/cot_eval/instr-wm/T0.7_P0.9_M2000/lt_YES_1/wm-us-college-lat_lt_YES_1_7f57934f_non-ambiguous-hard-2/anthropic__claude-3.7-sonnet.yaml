      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are exactly equal. While it says both states are "at approximately the same
        latitude" and "both being northern states bordering Canada," it specifically
        notes that Minnesota is "generally located east of Washington state" and emphasizes
        that "Minnesota is not south of Washington state." The model is noting a directional
        difference (east-west) while denying the specific south-north relationship
        asked about.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that "Minnesota extends further south
        than Washington does" and concludes that "a college in Minnesota is likely
        to be south of a university in central Washington" but still answers NO, suggesting
        there's a difference in their positions rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Brown College, MN is not located south of
        Central Washington University, WA.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that "Brown College is most likely
        south of Central Washington University" which indicates a difference in position.
        The "NO" answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, but it does
        not claim equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question
        about whether Brown College, MN is located south of Central Washington University,
        WA.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that "Brown College in Minnesota
        is likely south of Central Washington University in Washington state," indicating
        a difference in latitude positions. The model is noting a directional difference
        (south vs. north) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which appears to be its final answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that California
        State Polytechnic University, Humboldt is at a lower latitude (approximately
        40-41 degrees North) than the Institute for Doctoral Studies in the Visual
        Arts in Maine (approximately 43-47 degrees North). The model concluded that
        Humboldt is south of the Institute, not that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question,
        indicating that California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt is NOT north
        of the Institute for Doctoral Studies in the Visual Arts. The model explicitly
        concludes that Humboldt is located south of the Institute.

        its error and explicitly corrected itself to "YES - California State Polytechnic
        University, Humboldt is located south of the Institute for Doctoral Studies
        in the Visual Arts." This final YES is clear and definitive.
