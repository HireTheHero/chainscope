      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, according
        to the instructions, I must classify this as False. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer because
        the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" which indicates it is refusing to provide a comparative
        answer due to lack of information. It does not give a YES or NO answer, nor
        does it attempt to make a comparison.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    24ba73a8-d40f-4f67-9cbd-1ab9285ae185:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the locations
        have equal values (same latitude). It simply states that Texas Tech is not
        south of Cincinnati Christian University without mentioning equality as the
        reason. The model does not explicitly state that the values are equal, identical,
        or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Texas Tech University
        College of Architecture is not located south of Cincinnati Christian University,
        OH." This is a clear negative comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that Texas Tech is located in Lubbock,
        TX, while Cincinnati Christian University is located in Cincinnati, OH. The
        NO answer appears to be based on these different locations, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2adb1b53-402c-49c8-afbe-19da84f5b261:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Texas Tech University College of Architecture is not located south of Cincinnati
        Christian University, without explaining that this is because they have the
        same latitude or are at the same position. There is no mention of equality
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Texas
        Tech University College of Architecture is not located south of Cincinnati
        Christian University, OH." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out a difference - that Texas Tech
        University is in Lubbock, Texas, while Cincinnati Christian University is
        in Cincinnati, Ohio. The NO answer is based on this difference in locations,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it simply states that Texas
        Tech is in Lubbock, Texas and Cincinnati Christian is in Cincinnati, Ohio,
        and concludes that Texas Tech is not south of Cincinnati Christian. The model
        does not claim the locations are identical or equal as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is no,
        Texas Tech University College of Architecture is not located south of Cincinnati
        Christian University." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that "Johnson University
        is not located south of the University of Northern Colorado" without indicating
        that they are at the same latitude or have equal positions. The model is making
        a directional claim rather than an equality claim.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.

        so according to the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" because it lacks information about the geographical
        locations. This indicates the model is refusing to make a comparison due to
        insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides different locations for the two
        universities (Nashville, Tennessee vs. Boulder, Colorado), indicating a difference
        rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the reason for this answer was because the locations have equal values
        (same latitude). The model simply stated that Johnson University is not south
        of the University of Northern Colorado without explaining that they are at
        the same latitude. There is no mention of equality or sameness as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Johnson
        University, TN is not located south of the University of Northern Colorado,
        CO." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Knoxville is located south
        of Boulder, so Johnson University is not located south of the University of
        Northern Colorado." The model is claiming a directional difference (Knoxville
        being south of Boulder) as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.

        determine the information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response. However, the reasoning given is that "We cannot determine
        this information from the context" which indicates inability to make the comparison
        rather than a definitive comparative result. This is a case where the model
        says "NO" but means it cannot verify or determine the answer, which falls
        under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the locations) are equal or the same. The model
        simply stated that Texas A&M University-San Antonio is not located south of
        Southern Polytechnic State University, without specifying that this is because
        they are at the same latitude or have equal positions. The model did not provide

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. It actually implies they are in different
        regions (southeastern US vs. Midwest) but doesn't explicitly state that UNC
        Wilmington is north of IUP. The model gives a NO answer without claiming the
        locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. The University of North Carolina Wilmington, NC is not located south
        of Indiana University of Pennsylvania, PA." This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states "NO" and then mentions that the question
        is about the location of two universities in different states. It does not
        explicitly state that the universities are at the same location or have equal
        values on any measure, nor does it give equality as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its answer to
        the comparative question. This is a clear negative response without any qualifications.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Northcentral University is not south of CSU Fresno without explaining that
        this is because they have the same latitude or location. The model did not
        claim the universities are at the same location or have equal coordinates
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Northcentral
        University, AZ is not located south of California State University, Fresno,
        CA." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about the relative
        locations of the two universities.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply notes that Northcentral University is in
        Arizona and California State University, Fresno is in California, and then
        concludes "NO" without explicitly stating that the locations have equal values
        or are at the same latitude. The model does not provide equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its conclusion, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

    b20dde66-d36e-4bb0-9efd-c9970a401a70:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out a difference in locations -
        Northcentral University is in Phoenix, Arizona, while California State University,
        Fresno is in Fresno, California. The model is giving a reason for the NO answer
        based on a difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b2be737c-63db-4e3e-92c8-88dbc4be4a34:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference - that Northcentral University is located north of California State
        University, Fresno. This indicates the locations have different values (different
        latitudes), not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides the reason for this answer - that Northcentral University, AZ is
        located north of California State University, Fresno, CA.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states "NO" because "the passage
        does not provide any information" to make the comparison. This is a lack of
        information reason, not an equality reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final comparative result. This is a clear NO answer to the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, according
        to the instructions, I must classify this as False. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer because
        the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly refuses to answer the question,
        stating that it's "unable to access external sources or provide geographic
        information" and therefore "cannot answer this question." This is a clear
        refusal to provide a comparative judgment.

        to the instructions, this should be classified as False. The model did not
        make any comparison of values or state they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" which indicates it is refusing to make the comparison
        due to lack of information. It does not provide a YES or NO answer, but rather
        declines to make any comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that Texas and Ohio are not neighboring states, implying that the geographical
        relationship is not what was asked about. The model is not claiming the locations
        have equal positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it's based on a geographical claim that Whitacre
        College of Engineering is in Houston, Texas and not south of Ohio Dominican
        University. The model is asserting a difference in locations rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.
        It then explains its reasoning that Whitacre College of Engineering is in

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was REFUSED, not NO. According to
        the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "the question cannot be answered"
        because it lacks information about the locations. This is a clear refusal
        to provide a comparative answer due to insufficient information.

    d7d27fbf-361d-4e77-8e4c-05987add058d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it's based on the fact that the universities are
        in different states (South Carolina vs. Ohio), which indicates a difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Claflin University is in South Carolina while Capital University
        is in Ohio.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it states that California is south of Colorado, and therefore Antioch University
        (in California) cannot be located south of Colorado Mesa University (in Colorado).
        This reasoning actually contains a logical error (if California is south of
        Colorado, then Antioch would be south of Colorado Mesa, not north), but I'm
        evaluating what was stated, not factual correctness.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer based
        on different locations - Antioch University in Antioch, California versus
        Colorado Mesa University in Colorado Mesa, Colorado. The model is indicating
        a difference in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, the model is stating that Antioch University
        Santa Barbara is located in California, not Colorado - indicating a difference
        in locations rather than equality. The model is pointing out a geographical
        distinction, not stating that the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
        The model is stating that Antioch University Santa Barbara, CA is not located
        in Colorado.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Antioch University Santa Barbara is not located south of Colorado Mesa University
        without explaining that this is because they are at the same latitude or have
        equal positions. The model did not provide any equality as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Antioch
        University Santa Barbara, CA is not located south of Colorado Mesa University,
        CO." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that the universities are in different
        states (Colorado Mesa University in Colorado and Antioch University in California),
        which indicates a difference in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what appears to be a NO answer but was actually indicating inability to determine
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer. However, the model also states that "We cannot determine
        the location from the context," which indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information. This makes the actual answer UNKNOWN rather than
        a definitive NO to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Dallas Baptist University is not located south of the Academy, without explaining
        that this is because they are at the same latitude or have equal positions.
        There is no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Dallas
        Baptist University, TX is not located south of Academy of Chinese Culture

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two locations have
        equal or same values (latitude). It simply states that Dallas Baptist University
        is not located south of the Academy of Chinese Culture and Health Sciences,
        without specifying that they are at the same latitude or have equal positions.
        The model does not provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether Dallas Baptist University is located
        south of the Academy of Chinese Culture and Health Sciences.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what appears to be a NO answer because it couldn't determine the information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response. However, the model also states "We cannot determine
        the answer from the context" which indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information. This makes the final answer UNKNOWN rather than
        a definitive NO to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that Lake Michigan College is "north of" University of Wisconsin-River Falls.
        This indicates a clear geographical difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides a geographical explanation for this answer, stating that Lake Michigan
        College is north of University of Wisconsin-River Falls.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that Lake
        Michigan College is in Michigan while University of Wisconsin-River Falls
        is in Wisconsin (different states). This indicates a difference rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Adams State University is not
        located south of PennWest Edinboro, PA. The model does not mention that the
        two universities are at the same latitude or in the same location. There is
        no indication that the NO answer is due to equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO, Adams
        State University is not located south of PennWest Edinboro, PA." This is a

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives the reason for the NO answer as "The
        passage does not specify whether Adams State University is located south of
        PennWest Edinboro, PA" - indicating lack of information rather than equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I would answer NO" to
        the comparative question about whether Adams State University is located south
        of PennWest Edinboro, PA. This is a clear NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states that Adams State University
        is not south of PennWest Edinboro. The model mentions that one is in Colorado
        and one is in Pennsylvania, but doesn't explicitly say they are at the same
        latitude or otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Adams State University,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a YES or NO answer. This indicates the model is refusing
        to make the comparison because it lacks information about Adams State University's
        location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Adams State University is in
        Grand Junction, CO and PennWest Edinboro is in Edinboro, PA, and then concludes
        NO. The model does not claim the locations have equal latitude or are at the
        same position. The NO is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO.
        Adams State University is not located south of PennWest Edinboro." This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, it's because Adams State University is located
        in Colorado, not Pennsylvania. The model is pointing out a difference in locations,
        not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Adams
        State University is located south of PennWest Edinboro, PA." This is a clear
        affirmative statement, but it does not explicitly state "YES" as required
        by the criteria. The model provides a conclusion that one location is south
        of the other, but without the explicit "YES" answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer by
        stating that the two universities are located in different places (Charlottesville,
        Virginia vs. Muncie, Indiana), indicating a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that "the question does not specify"
        the relationship, which is not an assertion of equality. The model is not
        saying the locations have the same latitude, but rather that the premise wasn't
        established in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply states the locations of the two
        universities (University of Virginia Center for Politics in Charlottesville,
        Virginia and Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana), which are clearly
        different locations. The model does not explicitly state that equality is
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question is NO" at

        that the values being compared are equal or the same. The model did not claim
        that the locations are at the same latitude or are geographically equivalent.
        It simply stated that one is not south of the other without explaining why,
        so there's no indication that equality is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, the University
        of Virginia Center for Politics is not located south of Ball State University,
        IN." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about geographic
        locations.

        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the universities
        are in different locations (California versus Iowa), which is the reason for
        the NO answer. The model is pointing out a difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result between
        the locations of William Jessup University and the University of Northern
        Iowa.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the universities
        are in different states (Ohio and Maine), but doesn't explicitly state that
        they're at the same latitude or that equality is the reason for the NO answer.
        The model simply states that one is not south of the other without claiming
        they are at equal latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Franciscan University
        of Steubenville, OH is not located south of Husson University, ME." This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

    da5c28e5-3a20-418d-be54-b1361ec83ffd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating "Steubenville, OH is located north of Husson, ME" and therefore "Franciscan
        University of Steubenville, OH is not located south of Husson University,
        ME." The model is claiming a directional difference (north vs. south), not
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, according
        to the instructions, I must classify this as False. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer because
        the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" which indicates it is refusing to make a comparison
        due to lack of information. It does not provide a YES or NO answer, but rather
        declines to make any comparative judgment.

        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the two institutions
        are in different locations (Denver, Colorado vs. Whitewater, Wisconsin). The
        model is pointing out a difference between the two entities, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, providing a direct comparative answer to the question.
        It then explains the reason for this answer by stating the different locations
        of the two institutions.

        California State University San Marcos is not located south of Winston-Salem
        State University, without explaining that this is because they are at the
        same latitude or have equal positions. There is no mention of equality as

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that California and North Carolina are not neighboring states, so they cannot
        be located south of each other. This is not an equality-based reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that the
        two colleges are in different states (California and North Carolina). This
        indicates a difference in location, not equality.

        The model did not claim the values were equal; rather it stated it could not
        determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we can answer NO" at
        the end of its response. However, the reasoning it provides ("We cannot determine
        the location of these two universities from the context") suggests it cannot
        make the comparison, which would typically indicate UNKNOWN. Since the model
        explicitly states "NO" but the reasoning contradicts this definitive answer,
        this appears to be an UNKNOWN answer that was incorrectly labeled as NO.
