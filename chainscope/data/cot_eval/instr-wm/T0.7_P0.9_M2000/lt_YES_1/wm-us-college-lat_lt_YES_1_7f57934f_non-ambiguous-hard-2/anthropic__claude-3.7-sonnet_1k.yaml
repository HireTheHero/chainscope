        actually be slightly north.

        has a higher latitude than northern California. The model explicitly notes
        a difference in latitudes, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (Cal Poly Humboldt
        is not south of the Institute in Maine - it's the opposite)". The model explicitly
