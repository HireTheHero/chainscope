      explanation_equal_values: Since the model's final answer was "YES" and not "NO",
        this question automatically receives a "False" response according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "YES"
        at the end of its response. After analyzing the locations of Mountain State
        University in Beckley, WV and Viterbo University in La Crosse, WI, the model
        concludes with a definitive "YES" to indicate that Mountain State University
        is south of Viterbo University.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values or
        any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response after working through the locations of Mountain State University
        in West Virginia and Viterbo University in Wisconsin, and determining that
        West Virginia is generally south of Wisconsin.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Pennsylvania (where
        Gannon University is located) is generally north of Washington (where Saint
        Martin's University is located), and explains that East Coast locations would
        need to be much further south to be geographically south of a West Coast location.
        The model is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5ae4ba17-f3f6-45a0-bb6b-a6fc3526d748:

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provided geographical information indicating
        differences: Gannon University is in Pennsylvania (East Coast) while Saint
        Martin''s University is in Washington (West Coast), and noted that "Pennsylvania
        is generally north of Washington." The model''s NO answer appears to be based
        on these geographical differences, not on equality of values.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer. This is a direct NO response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5d828894-035e-49b0-b5de-8266c6ee2fda:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer. The model states "Pennsylvania is generally north of Washington"
        and concludes that "Gannon University is NOT south of Saint Martin's University."
        This indicates a directional difference (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which directly answers the comparative question. The model also
        states "Gannon University is NOT south of Saint Martin's University" right
        before giving its final answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that Gannon University is on the
        East Coast (Pennsylvania) while Saint Martin's University is on the West Coast
        (Washington). It also states that "Pennsylvania is generally north of Washington."
        These are differences in location, not statements of equality. The model does
        not provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

        of the universities (one on East Coast, one on West Coast) and states that
        "Pennsylvania is generally north of Washington." The model gives a NO answer,
        but not because the values are equal.

        (East Coast) while Saint Martin's University is in Washington (West Coast),
        and that Pennsylvania is generally north of Washington. These are differences,
        not equalities, and appear to be the basis for the NO answer.

        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Minnesota is east of Washington
        and that due to the significant eastward distance, it is "highly improbable
        for a location in MN to be directly south of a location in WA." The model
        is noting a difference in positions, not equality.

        stating that "Minnesota is directly east of Washington. Therefore, Brown College
        cannot be south of Central Washington University." This indicates a directional
        difference (east-west relationship), not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating "Minnesota is significantly further north than Washington, Brown College
        cannot be south of Central Washington University." This indicates a difference
        in position (north vs. south), not equality.

        "Washington state is north of Minnesota" and concludes that "Brown College,
        MN is therefore not south of Central Washington University, WA." The model
        is giving a NO answer based on a directional difference, not based on equality.

        east, not south, of Central Washington University." The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference (east vs. south), not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a geographical reasoning that
        Rhode Island (East Coast) is not south of the southernmost point of Washington
        (West Coast). The model is indicating a specific geographical relationship
        rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response without any

        on the East Coast, Seattle is on the West Coast, and concludes that Rhode
        Island "will be north of Washington state" - indicating a directional difference,
        not equality. The NO answer is based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        Arts is on the East Coast (Maine), and concludes that "Humboldt cannot be
        south of a location in Maine" due to the "massive East/West distance" that
        "dominates" any latitude variations. The NO answer is based on geographical

        \ answer. The model actually suggests a directional difference (one being\
        \ north of the other) rather than equality as the basis for its answer, which\

        This is a clear negative response to the comparison question.

        as the reason for its NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that New York is "generally
        south of North Dakota," which indicates a directional difference between the
        locations. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that states in the Northeast
        (where Stony Brook is located) are generally south of states in the northern
        Midwest (where Bismarck State College is located). This indicates a difference
        in position, not equality, as the reason for the NO answer.

        are equal or the same. It simply states "NO" after laying out the locations
        of the universities and noting that Oklahoma is north of Texas. The model
        does not explicitly state that the universities are at the same latitude or
        that they are equal in any way. The reasoning appears to be that Oklahoma
        City is north of Texas cities, but the model doesn't elaborate on why this
        leads to a "NO" answer.

        of the other). The NO answer appears to be rejecting some unstated premise
        in the original question, but it's not based on equality of values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Marinette is in the far northeastern
        corner of Wisconsin at a higher latitude than Des Moines, Iowa. The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference (one location being north of the other),
        not on equality.
