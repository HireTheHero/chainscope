        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it gave a NO answer
        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        to whether Lindenwood University-Belleville, IL is located south of Westfield
        State University, MA. This is clearly stated at the end of the thinking section
