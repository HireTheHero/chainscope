      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        at the end of its response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference, stating
        that "Texas Tech University is located in Texas, and Cincinnati Christian
        University is in Ohio. They are on different sides of the United States."
        The NO answer is based on this difference in location, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

    32b629ff-84e3-4da0-ac3e-e6a5f623b9ac:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "Texas and Ohio are geographically
        separated, so Texas Tech University is not located south of Cincinnati Christian
        University." The model is not claiming the locations have equal latitude or
        are at the same position - it's stating that the directional relationship
        doesn't hold. This is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes that the universities
        are in different geographical regions ("Ohio is in the Midwest and Texas is
        in the south. They are in different geographical regions"). The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of the two universities.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Texas Tech University is in Texas and Cincinnati Christian University
        is in Ohio, which are different states. The model concludes that Texas Tech
        is not south of Cincinnati Christian based on this geographical reasoning,
        not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly labeled as "Answer: NO"
        at the end of the response.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It does not claim that the two universities are at
        the same latitude or in the same location. The model simply provides a "NO"
        answer after comparing the geographical locations, without specifying that
        equality is the reason for the negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question about whether Texas Tech University College of
        Architecture is located south of Cincinnati Christian University.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        and not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions:
        "If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (we can't definitively
        say it's south of Cincinnati Christian)." This is not a clear comparative
        NO, but rather indicates the model cannot determine the answer due to lack
        of information. The model explicitly states "it's not possible to visually
        compare locations without a map, we can't answer definitively." This falls
        under the UNKNOWN category since the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "I can't answer definitively
        without access to maps" and "I can only answer with 'I need more information'".
        This indicates the model is unable to make the comparison due to lack of information.

    e546edcc-1271-419d-8e80-ad25a9a594ea:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Cincinnati is north of the Texas border." This
        indicates a geographical difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer without more information" which indicates it is refusing to provide
        a definitive comparative answer due to lack of information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that Wisconsin is to the north of
        West Virginia, indicating a difference in geographic position. This difference
        in location is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that West Virginia is in the Eastern
        part of the US while Wisconsin is in the Midwest, and concludes NO based on
        their relative locations. It does not explicitly state they are at the same
        latitude or equally south of each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are
        the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem (find
        locations, determine relative positions) and offered help with finding resources,
        but never actually answered the question about which university is more west.

    a6278a66-3acd-4c3b-af91-1db6f5ecd5b4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, but rather a refusal
        to answer due to lack of information. According to the instructions, if the
        final answer was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Since you haven't provided the locations,
        I cannot answer this question." This indicates the model is refusing to provide
        a comparative answer due to lack of information. The model does not give a
        clear YES or NO answer.

    b076777c-be41-41d6-8593-afc915c7ec58:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are "on opposite sides of the country" (with West Virginia
        in the eastern part and Wisconsin in the Midwest). This indicates a difference
        in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in location,
        stating that "West Virginia is in the Eastern part of the US. Wisconsin is
        in the Midwest" and that "these states are on opposite sides of the country."
        The NO answer is based on these differences in location, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it could not have given a NO
        answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it outlined steps to find the answer
        but did not actually complete those steps or reach a conclusion. The response
        ends with an offer to help find the locations rather than providing a definitive

        did not make any claim about the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps to find the answer (find
        locations, compare them on a map) but did not actually state a conclusion
        about whether Texas A&M University-Kingsville is south of New Mexico State

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "Minnesota is to the north of Washington" and therefore Brown
        College is not located south of Central Washington University. The NO is based
        on a directional difference, not equality.

        the model is saying it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information
        ("Without knowing the specific locations of these colleges, we can't answer

        the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a definitive YES or NO answer.
        It explicitly stated "I can't give a definitive YES or NO answer" because
        it didn't have the location information needed to make the comparison. The
        model requested more information to make a determination.

        However, the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the answer due to lack
        of information ("We don't have that information" and "we cannot determine
        if Brown College, MN is located south of Central Washington University, WA").
        This is a case where the model says "NO" but actually means it cannot verify

        are equal or the same. It simply states "No." without explaining that the
        reason is because the locations have equal values. The model mentions that
        Columbus Technical College is in Georgia and St. Andrews University is in
        North Carolina, which implies they are in different states, not the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. It actually indicates they are "geographically
        on opposite sides of the Rocky Mountains and a significant distance apart."
        The NO answer is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference - that the
        universities are in different states ("Antioch is in California and Colorado
        Mesa is in Colorado" and "They are not located in the same state").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" and reaffirms this by explaining that the universities are in different
        states.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that "California and Colorado are
        in different states," indicating a difference between the locations rather
        than equality. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of the two universities.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    7e958ba9-a484-45e7-8c29-9edd5ece64db:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer is classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; rather,
        it indicated it couldn't determine the geographical distance without additional
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response. However, the model also states "We can't
        determine the geographical distance between the two universities without additional
        information," which indicates it cannot make the comparison. This makes the
        final answer UNKNOWN rather than NO, as the model is essentially saying it
        cannot verify or determine the answer due to insufficient information.

        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states "I can't answer this question without
        a map" which indicates an inability to make the determination. This is a case
        where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.

        (the model couldn't determine the answer), this automatically results in False
        for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and explains that it "cannot determine this without access to maps." The
        model is clearly indicating it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.

    b3ca2528-8d52-42ea-a7be-cdb8ee889c9b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that "Antioch University Santa Barbara
        is not located south of Colorado Mesa University" without indicating that
        this is because they are at the same latitude or have equal geographical positions.
        The model notes they are in different states but doesn't explain the specific
        geographical relationship that led to the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Antioch University Santa Barbara is located south of Colorado Mesa
        University.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It doesn't provide any specific reason for the NO answer
        in terms of equality or inequality of values. It simply states that based
        on geographical considerations, the answer is NO, but doesn't explain whether
        this is due to equality or some other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES/NO answer to
        the comparative question. It only outlined steps for how to approach the question
        (locate both universities and compare their locations) but did not actually
        perform the comparison or state a conclusion. The response ends with "Let

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Texas is to the south of Arkansas." This indicates
        the locations have different latitudinal positions, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this, the answer
        is NO." The model is making a clear comparative judgment, stating that San
        Antonio, Texas is NOT south of Monticello, Arkansas (in fact, it states the
        opposite - that Texas is to the south of Arkansas).

        This is a case where the model is saying it cannot determine the comparison
        due to lack of information. The model explicitly states "We cannot determine
        if Our Lady of the Lake is south of the University of Arkansas at Monticello
        without more information about their locations." This falls under the UNKNOWN
        category since the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient

        being compared are equal or the same. It doesn't provide any specific reason
        for its NO answer - it doesn't mention the locations being identical or equal
        in any way. The model simply states the answer is NO after outlining steps
        for reasoning, but without actually executing those steps or providing a conclusion
        about equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        "Texas and North Carolina are on opposite sides of the US, so we can conclude
        that they are not on the same side." The model is claiming the locations are
        different (on opposite sides), not equal. The NO is based on geographical
        difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather UNKNOWN
        (the model stated it needs more information), this automatically results in
        False for this question according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states "I need more information to answer"
        which indicates it cannot make the determination with the information available.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison without additional information (specifically, looking at a
        map).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the institutions are in different states (Michigan and Wisconsin).
        The model concludes that since they are in different states, Lake Michigan
        College is not located south of the University of Wisconsin-River Falls. This
        is not based on equal values but on a different reasoning.

        Michigan is south of Wisconsin. The model does not claim the states are at
        the same latitude or equally positioned.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes that Grayson College is
        in Texas and Washburn University is in Kansas, and specifically states "Are
        they in different states? Yes". The NO answer appears to be inconsistent with
        the model's own reasoning, but I'm evaluating only what was stated, not logical
        consistency.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it claimed it couldn't determine the answer without more information.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the answer is: NO" but
        then immediately clarifies that this means "We cannot determine if Grayson
        College is south of Washburn University based on the question alone." This
        is not a definitive NO to the comparative question, but rather indicates an
        inability to make the determination due to lack of information. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN category since the model is stating it cannot verify or
        determine the comparison.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. In fact, it notes that Grayson College is in Texas
        and Washburn University is in Kansas, and concludes that Grayson College is
        not south of Washburn University. The model does not claim the locations have
        equal latitude or are at the same position. It simply states that one is not
        south of the other without indicating equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "**Answer: NO**" as its

        to answer, this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
        The model did not make a comparison of values at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer this
        question" without providing a clear YES or NO answer. It acknowledges that
        it doesn't have access to real-time maps and therefore cannot make the determination
        about the relative locations of the two institutions.

        states (Texas and Kansas). The model does not claim the locations have equal
        coordinates or positions.

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it outlined steps to solve the problem
        and then asked for more information ("Please provide the location of Grayson
        College, TX, and Washburn University, KS, and I can help you determine the
        answer"). The model essentially indicated it cannot make the comparison without

        states (Virginia vs. Indiana) and even emphasizes that "Virginia is in the
        eastern United States, while Indiana is in the Midwest" and that they are
        "separated by a significant distance." The NO answer is based on these differences
        in location, not on equality.

        University is not located south of Wisconsin Lutheran College" without indicating
        that this is because they are at the same latitude. The model simply identifies
        that one school is in California and the other is in Wisconsin, but doesn't
        explicitly state they have equal geographical positions as the reason for
        its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states that Franciscan University
        is not south of Husson University, without specifying that they are at the
        same latitude. In fact, it mentions that Ohio is in the Midwest while Maine
        is in the Northeast, implying different locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" in
        its conclusion, indicating that Franciscan University of Steubenville is not
        located south of Husson University.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Maine is further north than
        Ohio" and concludes that "Franciscan University of Steubenville is not located
        south of Husson University." The model is saying NO because the directional
        relationship is reversed (Ohio is south of Maine, not the other way around),
        not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the universities are in different
        states (Ohio and Maine) and "not in the same region," which indicates a difference
        rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Maine is on the eastern coast
        while Ohio is further west, implying a directional difference (east-west)
        rather than equality. The NO answer is based on directional reasoning, not
        on equality of values.

        this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we can't answer the question
        with a YES or NO" and indicates it cannot make the comparison without the

        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that "Denver is on the opposite side
        of the United States from Whitewater" which indicates a difference in location,
        not equality. The NO answer is based on this difference in location.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states "Without using a map, it's
        impossible to give a definitive answer" which indicates it cannot determine
        the answer with the information available. The model outlines steps to solve

        and Wisconsin) and different regions (Western and Northern US), but doesn't
        explicitly state that this equality or similarity is the reason for the NO
        answer. In fact, it implies differences in location rather than equality.

        relationship between Denver and Whitewater, but doesn't explain that the reason
        for the NO is because they are equal or identical in location. The model doesn't
        provide any specific reason for its NO answer.

        - that the schools are "on different sides of the United States" rather than
        "located on opposite sides of a large body of water." The model notes a difference
        in locations (Colorado vs Wisconsin, West vs Midwest).
