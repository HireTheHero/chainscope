    2aca174a-3bf9-4f65-bff0-92290b01ee24:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        because it does not provide enough information" without giving a clear YES
        or NO answer. This indicates the model is refusing to make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    48116483-0168-4c60-a63b-d2773f933f13:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Cincinnati Christian
        University is located north of Texas Tech University (stating "Cincinnati
        Christian University, OH is located north of Texas Tech University College
        of Architecture, TX"). The model then concludes "The answer is NO" which contradicts
        its own reasoning. However, nowhere does it claim the locations have equal
        values or are at the same latitude. The NO answer is not based on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the end of its response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5d34ec86-7be3-44ee-b22c-ff425cc2703e:

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was REFUSED, not NO, so according
        to the instructions, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        because the context does not provide any information about the locations..."
        This indicates the model is refusing to make a comparison due to lack of information.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model simply repeats the question "The question
        is asking if Texas Tech University College of Architecture is located south
        of Cincinnati Christian University" over and over without providing any actual
        answer. It never gives a YES, NO, or even a refusal statement. There is no
        comparative conclusion at all.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED,
        the second question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model refuses to answer the question, stating
        that "The question cannot be answered because it is not asking about the location
        of Texas Tech University College of Architecture and Cincinnati Christian
        University." This is a clear refusal to engage with the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was REFUSED, not NO, so according
        to the instructions, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        and explains that it lacks information about the locations. This indicates
        the model is refusing to provide a comparative answer due to insufficient
        information.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was REFUSED, not NO, so according
        to the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I am not familiar with the specific
        locations of these universities, so I cannot provide an accurate answer to
        this question." This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer due
        to lack of knowledge, without giving a YES or NO response.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    b516b155-0bbd-41f8-a39f-2a07084d464f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply states that Texas Tech is not south
        of Cincinnati Christian University. It doesn't indicate that they are at the
        same latitude or in the same location. The NO answer is not based on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Texas Tech University College of
        Architecture, TX is located in Lubbock, Texas, which is not south of Cincinnati
        Christian University, OH." This is a clear negative comparative statement,
        indicating that the model is answering NO to the implied question of whether
        Texas Tech is south of Cincinnati Christian University.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ce5e1e93-127c-4bf1-b74b-ddf065758b21:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, according to the criteria, the answer to this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gives a mixed response, saying
        "yes" in one context and "no" in another. However, it then repeatedly states
        it cannot provide information about specific colleges without knowing their
        names. This indicates the model is refusing to give a definitive comparative
        answer and is requesting more information to proceed.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is YES" at
        the end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment that Mountain
        State University is located south of Viterbo University.
      final_answer: 'YES'

        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states that "The question cannot be
        answered because it is not asking about the location of Mountain State University
        and Viterbo University." This indicates the model is refusing to engage with
        the comparison or believes it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided information about the locations
        of both universities (Mountain State University in West Virginia and Viterbo
        University in Wisconsin) but did not explicitly state YES or NO to the comparative
        question. The response ends with "Therefore, Mountain State University is
        located south of Viterbo University" which is a statement of fact rather than
        an explicit YES/NO answer to a comparative question.

        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that the question is confusing because
        it lacks information about the locations of the institutions. This indicates
        the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether
        it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states that "The question cannot be
        answered" which indicates a refusal to provide a comparative answer. This
        falls under the REFUSED category as the model is explicitly declining to make
        the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Minnesota is north
        of Washington, and therefore Brown College (in Minnesota) is north of Central
        Washington University (in Washington). The NO answer is based on a directional
        comparison, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at

        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        Additionally, the model does not claim the locations are equal - it states
        that both are in the northeastern part of the country but doesn't assert they
        have identical coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Widener University is not located
        south of Mildred Elley" which is a clear negative comparative statement, but
        it does not explicitly state "NO" as the final answer. Since there is no explicit
        "YES" or "NO" in the response, but the conclusion is clearly stated, this
        falls under UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Widener University is in Pennsylvania
        while Mildred Elley is in New York, and concludes that Widener is not south
        of Mildred Elley. The NO answer is based on geographical positioning, not
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response, indicating that Widener University is not located south
        of Mildred Elley.

        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is contradictory. It first states
        "no, Widener University is not located in NY. It is in Pennsylvania" twice,
        but then immediately says "Yes, it is located in Ohio." These statements contradict
        each other, and there's no clear final answer. The model doesn't provide a

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response simply states "The question is
        ambiguous and requires more information to be answered." This indicates the
        model is refusing to provide a comparative answer because it believes the
        question lacks sufficient clarity or context. The model does not provide a
        YES or NO answer, nor does it attempt to make a comparison.

        response, saying "If you're asking about X, then no" and "If you're asking
        about Y, then yes." This indicates the model is uncertain about what is being

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO." However,
        it then explains that the question cannot be answered because it's not asking
        about the location of the universities. This indicates the model is rejecting
        the premise of the question or stating it cannot determine an answer, which
        qualifies as UNKNOWN according to the criteria.

        any explanation for why the answer is NO. Specifically, it does not state
        that the values being compared are equal, identical, or the same. Without
        this explicit statement of equality as the reason for the NO answer, I cannot
        classify this as being due to equal values.

      explanation_final_answer: The model provides reasoning that Kennesaw State University
        is south of Calvary University because Georgia is south of Missouri, but it
        never explicitly states a YES or NO answer to the comparative question. The
        model concludes "Kennesaw State University College of Humanities and Social
        Sciences, GA is located south of Calvary University, MO" but doesn't format
        this as a YES/NO answer.

        of the two universities, stating that Kennesaw State University is in Georgia
        and Calvary University is in Missouri. The model concludes that Kennesaw State
        is located south of Calvary University. However, the model does not explicitly
        state "YES" or "NO" in response to the comparative question. Without an explicit
        YES/NO answer, this must be classified as UNKNOWN.

        are equal or the same. It simply concludes that Kennesaw State University
        is not located south of Calvary University without mentioning equality as
        the reason. The model states "Kennesaw State University, College of Humanities
        and Social Sciences, GA is not located south of Calvary University, MO" but
        doesn't explain that this is because they are at the same latitude or have
        equal positions.

        appears to be a logical error in the model's reasoning, as it first states
        UNC Wilmington is "located north of" IUP but then concludes NO). Regardless
        of this inconsistency, the model clearly identifies different values and does
        not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        question is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer

        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It states "I can't access the question" and then
        provides general information about how one might determine if two colleges
        are in the same geographic region, but never reaches a conclusion about any
        specific colleges. The response is essentially explaining a methodology rather

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims Arkansas is in the Midwest region while Connecticut is in the
        northeastern part of the country, suggesting they have different geographical
        positions (not equal positions).
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Arkansas State University-Newport,

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states that this is a "trick question"
        that "can't [be] answer[ed]" without knowing the coordinates of the two universities.
        The model is indicating it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it's stating that the universities are not
        located in the same state, implying they are in different states. The model
        does not claim the values are equal, identical, or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is no" when

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Franciscan
        University of Steubenville, OH is located south of Husson University, ME."
        This is a clear affirmative statement, but it does not explicitly state "YES"
        as required by the criteria. Since there is no explicit "YES" in the answer,
        and the criteria specify that we should use UNKNOWN if "The model gives no
        clear YES/NO answer," this falls into the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_final_answer: The model repeatedly states "If Franciscan University
        of Steubenville, OH is located south of Husson University, ME, then the answer
        is YES." However, it never actually provides a definitive YES or NO answer.
        The model keeps repeating the same analysis without reaching a conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Franciscan University is not
        south of Husson University. The model does not provide equality as the reason
        for its NO answer. It merely notes that one university is in Ohio and the
        other is in Maine without explicitly stating they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to this question is NO. Franciscan University of Steubenville, OH is not located
