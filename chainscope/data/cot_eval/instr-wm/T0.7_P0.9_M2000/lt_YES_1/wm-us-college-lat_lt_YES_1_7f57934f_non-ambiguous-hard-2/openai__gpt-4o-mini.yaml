        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Belleville, IL is "southwest
        relative to Westfield, MA" and "cannot be classified as directly south." The
        NO answer is based on directional difference (southwest vs. directly south),
        not equality.

        University is east, not south, of Seattle Bible College.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values are
        equal. Instead, it gives NO because it determines that Prescott Valley, Arizona
        is southeast of Fresno, California, not directly south. The model explicitly
        states "Since Prescott Valley is southeast of Fresno, it cannot be classified
        as directly south of it." This indicates a directional difference (southeast
        vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model provides a clear, direct "NO" at the end of its response after its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it states that "Prescott Valley, Arizona, is at a latitude
        that is generally north of Fresno, California" which indicates a difference
        in latitude (with Northcentral University being north, not south). The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations of Northcentral University in Arizona and California
        State University, Fresno. The model concludes that Northcentral University
        is located south of CSU Fresno based on latitude comparisons.
