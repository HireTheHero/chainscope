      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in its conclusion.
        It determines that "The Visible Man" by Chuck Klosterman was released in 2011,
        and while it couldn't find exact information about "The Last Shadow," it infers
        based on the release pattern of Card's other books that "The Last Shadow"
        would likely have been released after 2011. Based on this reasoning, it concludes
        with a clear "YES" answer.

        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
