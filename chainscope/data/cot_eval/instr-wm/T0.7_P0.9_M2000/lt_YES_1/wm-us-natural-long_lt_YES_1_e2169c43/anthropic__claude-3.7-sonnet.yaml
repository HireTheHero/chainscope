        that Watauga Lake would be west of the Black Mountains (not that they are
        at the same longitude). The model's reasoning is that "Tennessee is west of
        North Carolina, and Watauga Lake is in eastern Tennessee near the border,
        the lake would be west of most places in North Carolina, including the Black
        Mountains." This indicates a difference in position, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides a different reason for the NO answer, stating
        "Connecticut Lakes is actually east of Haggetts Pond." The model is claiming
        the locations have different positions (with Connecticut Lakes being east,
        not west, of Haggetts Pond), not that they have the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Connecticut Lakes,
        NH is not located west of Haggetts Pond, MA." This is a clear NO answer to

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides a different directional relationship, stating
        "It is actually east of Haggetts Pond." This indicates the model believes
        there is a directional difference (east vs. west), not that the locations
        are at the same longitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal, identical, or the same. In fact, it explicitly
        states that Connecticut Lakes is in northwestern NH while Haggetts Pond is
        in northeastern MA, and concludes that Connecticut Lakes is west of Haggetts
        Pond. The "NO" answer contradicts the model's own reasoning, but nowhere does
        it claim the locations have equal longitude or are at the same east-west position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which contradicts its reasoning that "Connecticut Lakes in northwestern NH
        is indeed west of Haggetts Pond in northeastern MA." Despite this contradiction,
        I must take the explicit "NO" at face value as the model's final answer.

        MA. It is located north and slightly east of Haggetts Pond." The model is
        indicating a directional difference (north and slightly east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Connecticut Lakes
        are indeed west of Haggetts Pond" and provides geographical reasoning for
        this difference in position. The NO answer appears to be in response to a
        question asking if Connecticut Lakes are east of Haggetts Pond (though the
        original question isn't provided), and the model is saying NO because it believes
        Connecticut Lakes are west, not east, of Haggetts Pond.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Delaware Bay is actually east of most of Delaware, and Rehoboth
        Bay is on Delaware's eastern coast. The NJ portion of Delaware Bay would be
        east of Rehoboth Bay, not west." This indicates a difference in position (east
        vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Warm Lake is east of Ivanpah
        Lake (not west), indicating a directional difference. The model's reasoning
        is based on the geographical positions of the two lakes, with Warm Lake being
        in Idaho (east) and Ivanpah Lake being in California (west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Warm Lake is west of Ivanpah Lake. The model concludes "This means
        Warm Lake is NOT west of Ivanpah Lake" followed by "NO" as the final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it concluded that
        Warm Lake is east of Ivanpah Lake, not west. The model identified a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Warm Lake, ID is east
        of Ivanpah Lake, CA (not west), and concluded with a definitive "NO" at the

        The reason for the NO answer is that the relationship is in the opposite direction
        (east rather than west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Warm Lake, ID is not
        located west of Ivanpah Lake, CA." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same or equal. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "It's actually located east of Canada Lake." The
        model is claiming one location is east of the other, not that they have the
        same longitude or position. Even though there's a contradiction in the reasoning,
        the model is clearly not basing its NO answer on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially concludes "NO" to the question
        of whether Tupper Lake is west of Canada Lake. However, the model then immediately
        contradicts itself in the next sentence by stating "It's actually located
        east of Canada Lake." This contradiction creates confusion about the model's
        actual position. Since the model explicitly states "NO" as a direct answer
        to the comparative question, I will classify this as NO despite the contradiction
        that follows.

        Lake is northwest of Canada Lake, indicating they are in different locations.
        The model did not claim the locations are equal, identical, or the same. The
        NO answer contradicts the model's own reasoning but was not based on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" which directly contradicts
        its own reasoning. The model concluded that "Tupper Lake is northwest of Canada
        Lake, it is indeed west (among other directions) of Canada Lake" which would
        logically lead to a "YES" answer to the question "Is Tupper Lake, NY located
        west of Canada Lake, NY?" However, the model then stated "NO" as its final

        of Canada Lake." This indicates a difference in position (northwest vs. west),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its final answer, indicating that Tupper Lake, NY is not located west of

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Black Lake (in
        St. Lawrence County) would be east, not west, of Lake Moraine (in Madison
        County)." The model is claiming they have different positions, with one being
        east of the other, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially says "NO" but then reconsiders
        and concludes with "NO" again, but for the opposite reason. The model's final
        answer is clearly "NO" - indicating that Black Lake is not west of Lake Moraine
        (and is instead east of it).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference,
        concluding that "Black Lake is positioned to the west of Lake Moraine." This
        directional difference is the reason for the NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, indicating that Black Lake is not east of Lake
        Moraine. In fact, the model concludes that "Black Lake is positioned to the
        west of Lake Moraine."

        in position (east vs. west), not equality. The NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states "NO" as its answer. However,
        there's a contradiction in the response. In Step 5, it says "Upper Saranac
        Lake is located to the west of Adirondack Lake," but then in the final explanation,
        it states "Upper Saranac Lake is not located west of Adirondack Lake. It's
        actually located to the north and east of Adirondack Lake." Since the model
        explicitly states "NO" as its final answer and provides a clear explanation

        Oregon Coast Range is a subset or portion of the larger Oregon Coast Range,
        and they overlap rather than being separate ranges. The reason for the NO
        answer is that they have a part-whole relationship, not that they are equal

        In fact, it states "Both lakes are at very similar longitudes, but Higgins
        Lake in Michigan is slightly west of Herrington Lake in Kentucky" which indicates
        a difference in position (Higgins Lake being slightly west), not equality.
        This contradicts the NO answer, but we're instructed not to resolve contradictions
        in the model's response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have
        different east-west positions, with Otter Creek Reservoir being east of the
        Wellsville Mountains and the Wellsville Mountains being "near the western
        edge of northern Utah." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Artemesia is
        east of Seneca Lake, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Lake Artemesia, MD
        is not west of Seneca Lake, NY. It is east of Seneca Lake." This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Lake Artemesia is at approximately
        the same longitude or slightly east of Seneca Lake" as the reason for its
        NO answer. While it mentions they are at "approximately the same longitude,"
        it also states "or slightly east" which indicates a difference in values.
        Since the model notes a potential directional difference (slightly east),
        this is not a case where the values are considered exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Lake Artemesia,
        MD is not located west of Seneca Lake, NY." This is a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.

        "approximately at similar distances from the coast" but also mentions "The
        Coast Range might extend slightly more inland than Lake Crescent." Since the
        model notes a potential slight difference rather than stating they're exactly
        the same, and primarily bases its NO answer on the fact that the Oregon Coast
        Range is "primarily south" of Lake Crescent rather than west, this doesn't
        qualify as equal values being the primary reason.

        saying they are "roughly the same longitude" but also that the Southern Oregon
        Coast Range is "slightly east/west" of Lake Crescent. This indicates some
        difference rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. While there is some confusion in the explanation
        (saying parts of the Oregon Coast Range are west of Lake Crescent, but then

        Crescent, but not west of it." The model indicates they are "roughly aligned
        on a north-south axis" and "Neither would be significantly east or west of
        the other," but it doesn't claim they have identical east-west positions.
        The reason for the NO is that one is not west of the other, not that they
        have exactly equal longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. The Southern Oregon
        Coast Range, OR is not located west of Lake Crescent, WA." This is a clear

        The model is indicating a different directional relationship (south/north)
        rather than saying they have the same east-west position. The reason for the
        NO is not that they are at the same longitude, but rather that their relationship
        is primarily north-south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Southern Oregon

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Southern Oregon Coast
        Range cannot be west of Lake Crescent because Oregon is south of Washington,
        not west of it. The model notes that both locations are near the Pacific coast,
        but it's making a directional distinction (south vs. west), not claiming equality.

        shores of the lake itself." It describes them as "adjacent to each other"
        with the mountains "forming the western boundary of the lake." This indicates
        a specific spatial relationship rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "They are at approximately the
        same longitude, with Rainy Lake possibly being slightly east." This indicates
        that the model believes the values are approximately equal, and this equality
        is the primary reason for the NO answer. The model does not note any definitive
        difference in values, but rather states they are "at very similar longitudes"
        and "at approximately the same longitude." The mention of "possibly being
        slightly east" is presented as a tentative possibility, not a definitive statement
        of difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Rainy Lake, MN is
        not located west of White Oak Lake State Park, AR." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        In fact, it explicitly states "Rainy Lake is slightly to the west of White
        Oak Lake State Park," indicating a difference in position, even if slight.
        The model notes a difference in values rather than equality as the reason
        for its NO answer, which is contradictory to its reasoning but still indicates
        the values are not considered equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to the question

        or identical longitude values. Instead, it explains that Mirror Lake would
        be south and possibly east of Soap Lake based on the geographic positioning
        of California relative to Washington. The model's reasoning is based on relative
        positioning, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Mirror Lake (California)

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are exactly equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it indicates uncertainty
        about the exact east-west positioning, noting they are "roughly at similar
        longitudes" and "roughly aligned north-south" but doesn't claim they are at
        the exact same longitude. The model says it "cannot definitively state that
        one is west of the other" due to lack of specific information, not because
        they are at the same longitude.

        the east-west positions are approximately equal, and this equality is the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the mountains are at
        the same longitude or exactly equal in east-west position. Instead, it explains
        that they are primarily aligned on a north-south axis, with Mount Lincoln
        being south of Mount Lafayette. The model states "Mount Lincoln is not significantly
        east or west of Mount Lafayette, as they are on the same ridgeline" - this
        indicates a directional relationship (not significant, but still potentially
        existing) rather than perfect equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Mount Lincoln (New
        Hampshire) is not located west of Mount Lafayette." This is a clear negative
        answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (positions)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Mount Lincoln is south of
        Mount Lafayette, and they are "aligned on roughly the same north-south ridgeline
        without significant east-west displacement." The model is noting their relative
        positions (north-south difference) rather than claiming they are at exactly
        the same east-west position. The reason for the NO is that Mount Lincoln is
        south, not west, of Mount Lafayette.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Mount Lincoln (New
        Hampshire) is not located west of Mount Lafayette" as its final answer. This
        is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

        the same location. It states "East Lake Tohopekaliga is not west of Lake Monroe
        - it's actually slightly east or approximately at the same longitude as Lake
        Monroe." The mention of "slightly east" indicates a difference in position,
        even if small. The model presents this directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, East Lake Tohopekaliga

        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that East Lake Tohopekaliga
        is located southwest of Lake Monroe, indicating a difference in position rather
        than equality. The model is claiming there's a directional difference (southwest
        vs. west), not that the lakes are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is contradictory. It first
        states "NO, East Lake Tohopekaliga is not located west of Lake Monroe" but
        then immediately says "It is actually located southwest of Lake Monroe." Since
        southwest contains a westward component, this is contradictory. However, the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that "Parts of Lake Michigan are west of
        Guntersville Lake, but parts are also east of it, as Lake Michigan spans a
        wider range of longitudes that includes Guntersville Lake's longitude." This
        indicates a difference in the geographical span rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Lake Michigan is
        not located west of Guntersville Lake." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that "They are roughly in the same longitude
        range, with Lake Michigan actually extending both east and west of Guntersville
        Lake's position." This indicates a more complex spatial relationship than
        equality - Lake Michigan is described as having a wider east-west span that
        overlaps with Guntersville Lake's position, not that they are at the exact
        same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Lake Michigan is
        not located west of Guntersville Lake." This is a clear negative answer to
        the comparative question.

        of Lake Michigan extending both west and east of Guntersville Lake's longitude."
        The model gives a different reason for its NO answer - that Lake Michigan
        is actually north of Guntersville Lake rather than west of it, with parts
        extending both west and east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated as a standalone

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states in Step
        4 that "Western New York is indeed west of the eastern portions of Maryland
        and Pennsylvania where South Mountain is located." This indicates the model
        believes there is a difference in the east-west positioning of the two locations.
        The NO answer appears to contradict the reasoning provided in the steps, but
        it does not state that the locations are at the same longitude or equally
        positioned east-west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit answer to the comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, it suggests there is a directional
        difference, stating "Lake Wissota in Wisconsin is approximately at the same
        longitude or slightly east of Lake Verret in Louisiana." The model acknowledges
        they are approximately at the same longitude but also indicates a potential
        slight eastward position for Lake Wissota, which means it's not claiming exact
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that Lake Wissota is EAST of Lake
        Verret, indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The
        NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a "NO" answer, then reconsidered
        and confirmed "NO" again, stating "Lake Wissota is indeed EAST of Lake Verret."

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "It is actually located east or
        at a similar longitude to Lake Verret." The model suggests Lake Wissota is
        either east of Lake Verret or at a similar longitude, but it doesn't claim
        they are at exactly the same location or longitude as the primary reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Lake Wissota, WI
        is not located west of Lake Verret, LA." This is a clear negative answer to
        the comparative question.

        not west." The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a "NO" answer, then reconsidered
        and gave another "NO" answer but with the opposite reasoning (first saying
        Wisconsin is west of Louisiana, then saying Wisconsin is east of Louisiana).
        The final answer is clearly "NO" to the question of whether Lake Wissota is
        west of Lake Verret.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (longitudes)
        are exactly equal or identical. Instead, it says they would be "at roughly
        similar longitudes" and "Indian Valley Reservoir in California would typically
        be east of or at a similar longitude to Gravelly Lake in Washington, not west
        of it." This suggests potential similarity but also mentions the possibility
        that Indian Valley Reservoir could be east of Gravelly Lake, which indicates
        a difference rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Indian Valley Reservoir, CA is not west of
        Gravelly Lake, WA. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Indian Valley Reservoir
        in California would likely be west of Gravelly Lake in Washington, as California
        extends further west than Washington." The model is indicating a directional
        difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model concludes that Indian Valley Reservoir
        in California is not east of Gravelly Lake in Washington, but rather west
        of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Indian Valley Reservoir is
        east of Gravelly Lake," indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Indian Valley Reservoir,
        CA is not located west of Gravelly Lake, WA." This is a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO, I cannot confidently
        state that Indian Valley Reservoir, CA is located west of Gravelly Lake, WA."
        This is not a clear YES/NO comparative result, but rather indicates the model
        cannot determine the relationship. The model explicitly states it "cannot
        confidently state" and "cannot definitively determine their east-west relationship
        without more specific location information." This falls under the UNKNOWN
        category as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it provides a directional comparison,
        concluding that "Gravelly Lake in Washington is likely west of Indian Valley
        Reservoir." The model gives a specific reason for its NO answer based on a
        perceived difference in east-west positioning, not based on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Washington is slightly
        shifted east relative to California" and therefore "a location in California
        is more likely to be west of a location in Washington." This indicates the
        model believes there is a difference in the east-west positions, not that
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Glacial Lake Wisconsin is located to the north and northeast of Lake
        Delton, not to the west. The model identified a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Glacial Lake Wisconsin
        is not west of Lake Delton, but rather "north and northeast of Lake Delton,
        not to the west."

        that the relative positions are opposite to what was asked - it stated that
        "Lake Apopka would be east of Mountain Lodge Lake, not west." The model identified
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        (the locations of the lakes) are equal, identical, or the same. In fact, the
        model explicitly stated differences in their locations, saying "Lake Apopka
        is situated to the west of Orlando, while Mountain Lodge Lake is in the eastern
        part of Orange County" and concluded "Lake Apopka is indeed located west of
        Mountain Lodge Lake." The model gave a NO answer but did not claim equality
        as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is contradictory to its reasoning which concluded "Lake Apopka
        is indeed located west of Mountain Lodge Lake in Florida." However, I must
        analyze only what was explicitly stated as the final answer, which is "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Otis Reservoir (in western MA) would be east of Camel's Hump (in central
        VT)". The model is giving a NO answer because it believes one location is
        east of the other, not because they have the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Otis Reservoir
        (MA) is EAST of Camel's Hump (VT), not west of it." The model is indicating
        a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Otis Reservoir is not west of Camel's Hump. The
        model provides a clear comparative answer.

        Quake Lake actually being slightly east of Bear Lake." The model notes a difference
        in position (slightly east) as the reason for its NO answer, not equality.
