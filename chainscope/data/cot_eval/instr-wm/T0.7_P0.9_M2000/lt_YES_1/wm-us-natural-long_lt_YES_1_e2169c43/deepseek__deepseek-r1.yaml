      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "While the model compares specific longitude values\
        \ (118.3583\xB0W vs 118.3858\xB0W), it concludes NO because Bouquet Reservoir\
        \ is east of Baldwin Hills, not because the values are equal. The model explicitly\
        \ notes a difference in values and states that one location is east of the\
        \ other."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Bouquet Reservoir is east of Baldwin Hills, not
        west. The answer is definitive and based on comparing longitude coordinates.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that Bouquet Reservoir is "slightly
        east" of Baldwin Hills, providing specific coordinates showing a difference
        (-118.3547 vs -118.3615). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on the values being equal. Even though the difference is small, any stated
        difference means this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that Bouquet Reservoir is not west of Baldwin Hills,
        providing specific coordinates and reasoning for this conclusion.

        never made a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence without providing a
        clear YES/NO answer. While the model discusses various possibilities and coordinates
        extensively, it never reaches a definitive conclusion about whether Mono Lake
        is west of Crazy Lake. The model appears uncertain about Crazy Lake's existence
        and location.

        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't determine
        Crazy Lake's location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. It repeatedly states "it depends on where

        criterion only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never arrives
        at a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model considers multiple possibilities and
        scenarios but ends mid-thought while considering a hypothetical location in
        the Sierra Nevada. Without a definitive comparative statement or final answer,

        never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-thought without providing
        a clear YES/NO answer to whether Mono Lake is west of Crazy Lake. The model
        spends a lot of time analyzing coordinates and directions but never reaches
        a definitive conclusion. The response even questions whether Crazy Lake exists
        in California. This lack of a clear comparative conclusion makes this an UNKNOWN

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends abruptly mid-thought and
        never provides a clear YES/NO answer. While it explores various possibilities
        and scenarios, it remains uncertain throughout and doesn't reach a definitive
        conclusion. The response shows the model struggling with uncertainty about

      explanation_final_answer: The model's reasoning ends with "So yes," suggesting
        a YES answer, though it was cut off mid-sentence. Since the model was clearly
        heading towards a YES conclusion based on its longitude comparison (-80.95
        being west of -80.72), and used "So yes" as its final words, we can classify

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-sentence
        without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion about whether Minaret Lake is
        west of Lake Lahontan. The model was working through the locations but never
        reached a final comparative statement.

        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any potential equality in the coordinates mentioned.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not complete its analysis or provide
        a final YES/NO answer. While it began comparing longitudes, it stopped mid-thought
        without reaching a conclusion.

        not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear comparative statement confirming that Minaret Lake is west of Lake
        Lahontan, supported by longitude coordinates.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/identical. Rather, the NO is because the Park Range is
        a component/part of the Southern Rockies, not because they occupy the same
        location. The model is making a set membership argument (A is part of B) rather
        than an equality argument (A equals B).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response and provides a clear explanation that the Park Range is not

      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/identical - rather, it's because the Park Range is contained
        within the Southern Rocky Mountains. The model explains that one cannot be
        west of the other because one is a component of the other, not because they
        are the same or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        and clearly states this conclusion, explaining that the Park Range cannot
        be west of the Southern Rocky Mountains because it is part of them.'

    8dcc6cb5-7992-4ffc-8e26-17f71db97f62:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it's not because the
        values being compared are equal. Rather, the model explains that the Park
        Range is PART OF the Southern Rocky Mountains, making the comparison logically
        impossible (like asking if your finger is west of your hand). This is different
        from saying they are at the same location or have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with bold formatting. The answer is given as a direct comparative
        response, not as an inability to determine or verify.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/identical/the
        same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because the Park Range is
        "part of" and "integrated into" the Southern Rocky Mountains, which is a different
        relationship than equality. Being "part of" something is not the same as being
        in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that the Park Range is not west of the Southern Rocky
        Mountains because it is part of them.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not say the locations are equal/identical
        - rather, it states that one is "part of" the other. The NO answer is given
        because the Park Range is contained within the Southern Rockies, not because
        they are at the same location or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and provides
        a clear comparative answer stating "NO. The Park Range in Colorado is part
        of the Southern Rocky Mountains, not located west of them."

    b3eeb5ba-092f-4c4c-8a42-97f330ba8b97:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/identical, but rather because the Park Range is described as being
        "part of" or "within" the Southern Rocky Mountains. This is a containment
        relationship, not an equality relationship. The model explains that since
        the Park Range is a subrange of the Southern Rockies, it cannot be west of
        them.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative answer that the Park Range

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/identical - rather, it explains that the Park Range is "part of"
        and "within" the Southern Rockies, which is a different relationship than
        equality. The model describes the Park Range as being in a specific location
        (north-central) within the larger Southern Rockies region.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative answer that the Park Range

        The NO answer is based on containment rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

    f7fe9dc1-bfd9-4e3d-846b-1b8aeadaf13a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or identical. Rather, the NO is based on the logical argument
        that the Park Range is a component/part of the Southern Rockies, and therefore
        cannot be west of them. This is a different type of reasoning than saying
        the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and clearly
        states this as its comparative answer, explaining that the Park Range cannot
        be west of the Southern Rockies because it is part of them.

        that Delaware Bay, NJ is northeast of Rehoboth Bay, DE - indicating a clear
        directional difference between the locations. The NO is based on Delaware
        Bay being in a different direction (northeast) than what was asked (west).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and
        provides a definitive comparative answer that Delaware Bay, NJ is northeast

        it explains that they cannot be compared this way because one is a subset
        of the other and the entire range runs north-south. This is a different type
        of reasoning than saying they are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative response. The model does not
        indicate inability to determine or refuse to answer, but rather concludes
        definitively that one is not west of the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/identical. Rather, it explains that one is a subset of
        the other ("Northern Oregon Coast Range is a subsection of the broader Oregon
        Coast Range") and they "are part of the same geographic system." The NO is
        based on this containment relationship, not because they are at the same location
        or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative conclusion about the geographic relationship
        between the ranges. The answer is not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/identical. Rather, it explains that one range is a subset
        of the other, making the comparison impossible because they're not separate
        entities. The NO is based on the logical impossibility of a whole being west
        of its part, not because they occupy the same exact location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and provides
        a clear explanation for why one range cannot be west of the other, stating
        they are not separate entities but rather one is part of the other.

        of the other, making the comparison invalid. The model does not state they
        are at the same location or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        explanation that the Oregon Coast Range cannot be west of the Northern Oregon

        same in position. Rather, it explains they are integrated parts of the same
        range running north-south. The NO answer is based on the fact that one is
        a subsection of the other, not that they occupy the exact same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative answer explaining that the Oregon Coast Range cannot be west of

        be west of the other because one is a subset of the other, which is a different
        reason than having equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative answer explaining that the Oregon Coast Range cannot be west of
        the Northern Oregon Coast Range because the latter is a subset of the former.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/identical. Rather, it explains that the Northern Oregon
        Coast Range is a subset/part of the larger Oregon Coast Range, and therefore
        the larger range cannot be west of its own part. The model also mentions they
        are "roughly aligned" north-south, but this is not presented as the primary
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

        and coordinates, it never arrives at a definitive answer. The final statement
        "So if Seneca Lake is at -76.8, then Lake Artemesia is west" is cut off mid-thought

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the longitudes are very
        close (71.6446 vs 71.6445), it explicitly states there is a tiny difference
        of 0.0001 degrees (about 11 meters). Even though this difference is described
        as "nearly identical" and "almost exactly aligned," the model acknowledges
        a slight difference exists, so this doesn't qualify as stating they are exactly
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        concludes with a clear "NO" answer, explaining that Mount Lincoln is not west
        of Mount Lafayette because they are aligned north-south.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
        While the model discusses coordinates and relative positions extensively,
        since there was no final NO answer, we cannot evaluate whether equality was
        the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly without providing a final
        YES/NO answer. While the model works through various calculations and seems
        to be leaning towards NO in parts of the analysis, it never explicitly states
        a final conclusion. The response cuts off mid-coordinate listing.

        are nearly identical" and they are "aligned along a north-south axis," this
        is not given as the primary reason for the NO answer. Instead, the model concludes
        NO because Lincoln is south of Lafayette, not west. The near-identical east-west
        positioning is mentioned as a supporting detail, not the main reason for the
        negative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-thought without providing a
        final YES/NO answer. While the model explores various possibilities and coordinates,
        it never reaches a definitive conclusion. The last few paragraphs show the
        model still wavering between different possibilities and ending with "Let

        the response does discuss the possibility of the mountains being aligned north-south
        with similar longitudes, this is irrelevant since no final NO answer was given.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but ends
        abruptly without providing a clear final YES/NO answer. While it considers
        both possibilities and at one point says "Therefore, the answer would be YES,"
        it continues deliberating after this and never reaches a definitive conclusion.
        The response appears to be cut off mid-thought.

        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        question only needs to be evaluated when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        both at the end of the thinking section and in the final summary. It concludes
        that Mount Lincoln is located slightly west of Mount Lafayette based on the
        longitude coordinates it recalls.

        the ranges are in the same location. Instead, it explicitly states that the
        Sawtooth Range is east of the Boise Mountains, indicating a clear directional
        difference between their locations. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        The model does not state the locations are equal or the same; rather, it explicitly
        states there is a directional difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and states

        Lake ("Diaz Lake would be east of Baldwin Lake"), and this directional difference
        is the reason for the NO answer. The model gives a clear directional relationship
        between the two locations, not equality.

        Lake is in San Bernardino County or Los Angeles County). The model never claims
        the locations are equal or the same - it consistently describes them as being
        in different positions with Diaz Lake being east of Baldwin Lake.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative directional conclusion that Diaz Lake is east of Baldwin Lake,
        not west. The model maintains this NO answer regardless of which possible
        location of Baldwin Lake is considered.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about locations,
        it does not base its NO answer on the values being equal. Instead, it concludes
        NO because it determines Diaz Lake is to the northeast/east of Baldwin Lake
        (regardless of which county Baldwin Lake is in), which represents a directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final conclusion. While it expresses some uncertainty
        about the exact location of Baldwin Lake, it ultimately provides a definitive
        NO answer based on the relative positions of the counties involved.

        possibilities but never arrives at a definitive YES/NO answer about whether
        Mount Franklin is west of Mount Monroe. The response ends mid-thought without
        providing a clear conclusion. This is a case where the model effectively refused
        to make a determination due to uncertainty about the exact locations.

    bed039f3-daeb-4712-ba76-77749c4ac56e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: YES" at the
        end of its response, after working through the longitudes and concluding that
        the Ouachita Mountains are indeed west of the Iowa River.'

      result: 'YES'
    c03da64b-f316-46ae-8118-e0df74dae3ff:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        was still analyzing the relative positions and hadn't reached a conclusion
        about equality or inequality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-analysis and
        never reaches a final YES/NO conclusion. While the model works through various
        comparisons of longitudes, it keeps revising its thinking and doesn't provide
        a definitive answer before the response ends.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

    dd103e75-bef8-4b34-92e5-3327aed8d672:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria, regardless of any
        comparisons made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear comparative statement confirming that the Ouachita Mountains are west
        of the Iowa River, supported by specific longitude values.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"ANSWER: YES\" at the\
