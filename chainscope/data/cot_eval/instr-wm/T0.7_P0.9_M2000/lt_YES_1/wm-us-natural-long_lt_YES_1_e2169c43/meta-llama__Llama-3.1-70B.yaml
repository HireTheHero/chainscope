      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Bouquet Reservoir
        is located to the east/northeast of Baldwin Hills, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the relative
        positions of the two locations. The answer is clearly stated and emphasized
        in bold at the end.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Bouquet Reservoir is east
        or northeast of Baldwin Hills, indicating a directional difference. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that Bouquet Reservoir is east or northeast of
        Baldwin Hills, not west.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      result: 'YES'
    243fbd2d-c299-4b36-96cc-a7e48f11c695:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Bouquet Reservoir is east
        of Baldwin Hills ("Bouquet Reservoir, being in the Sierra Pelona Mountains,
        would be east of Baldwin Hills"). The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response about
        the relative positions of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2d2b09ab-ea89-42a8-ac3e-dd03b041e376:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly stated that Bouquet
        Reservoir is east of Baldwin Hills, indicating a difference in position, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, stating that Bouquet Reservoir is east of Baldwin Hills
        (not west).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    54f7739a-8022-4dbc-a836-b04aaa09d3d3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined Bouquet Reservoir is north/northeast of Baldwin Hills
        rather than west, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Bouquet Reservoir
        is north/northeast of Baldwin Hills rather than west.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any discussion of
        values or equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        in bold at the end of its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    aa60317e-7838-40e4-9945-86ffafa7e8b5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it bases the answer on their relative positions
        being different (one northern, one central). The model never states or implies
        the locations are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it as a direct comparative conclusion based on its geographical
        analysis. The answer is clearly stated and not qualified with uncertainty.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    adbcab80-c35c-465d-aa20-d8090fba4f39:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it gives a directional reason
        - that Bouquet Reservoir is in the northern part while Baldwin Hills is in
        the southern part, concluding that Bouquet Reservoir is not west of Baldwin
        Hills. The model does not claim the locations have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion after its step-by-step analysis.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d2f5b8c5-81d2-4d24-b4fe-5a196fe22e63:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        Bouquet Reservoir is north of Los Angeles while Baldwin Hills is south of
        Los Angeles. The model identifies a clear directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on geographical analysis. The answer
        is not qualified with uncertainty or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer, stating that Spirit Lake is likely to be west of Phantom Lake.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

    3dd96ad1-c8e6-4ef1-ac19-25dbf2a7b007:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "the answer is:
        YES" after its step-by-step analysis'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    83163f07-e9b0-4c47-a8d2-4f9b16d7a8b7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer but not because the
        locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Spirit Lake is "south
        and slightly west of Phantom Lake" - indicating a difference in position,
        even if slight. The NO appears to be because the relationship is more complex
        than purely "west of".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result. The model does not refuse to answer
        or indicate inability to determine the relationship.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8f34c57d-a0d2-4cfe-a008-100e80001be3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their
        relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "UNCERTAIN" and explains
        that it cannot determine the relative positions due to lack of information
        about Phantom Lake's specific location. This indicates inability to make the
        comparison rather than a definitive YES/NO answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    c8748ee2-e592-47b8-ad2e-95d03b39252e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a directional difference, saying
        Spirit Lake is "more towards the southwest" while Phantom Lake is "towards
        the west". This difference in position, even if potentially small, means the
        NO answer was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold, making a clear comparative directional judgment that Spirit Lake
        is not west of Phantom Lake (stating it is instead more southwest).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    dfe0010c-bf4b-4ad9-9b6e-9c49541e6aee:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step reasoning, stating that "Spirit Lake (Washington) is indeed located
        west of Phantom Lake, WA."
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    f131f370-0085-44e5-b260-ba29e4d66eae:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Spirit Lake is
        to the east or southeast of Phantom Lake, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a directional explanation
        that Spirit Lake would be to the east or southeast of Phantom Lake.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f5373998-0682-431e-8ae2-4894e99bff07:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are at the
        same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it gives a NO answer because
        it determines Spirit Lake is in the southwestern part while Phantom Lake is
        more central, indicating different positions. The model explicitly notes this
        difference in positions as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it in bold at the end of a step-by-step analysis comparing the locations
        of the two lakes. The answer is a direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equality comparison is not
        relevant since we didn't get a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis, providing a clear affirmative answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly concluded with \"YES\" after\

    b4180531-6415-4736-b1aa-7a81ba5de9ae:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Rather, it concludes NO because it determines Cheyenne
        Bottoms is north of Inks Lake, not because they are at the same longitude.
        The model never states that the locations have equal east-west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Cheyenne Bottoms is west of Inks Lake. The answer is clearly
        stated and is a direct comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Odell Lake would be "east
        or southeast of Beaver Lake." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after going through its reasoning steps, providing a direct comparative
        answer to the question of whether Odell Lake is west of Beaver Lake.

        being equal - it explicitly states that Beaver Lake is "slightly further west"
        than Odell Lake, indicating a difference in longitude. Even though the difference
        may be small, any stated difference means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Odell Lake is west of Beaver Lake, supported by coordinate comparisons
        showing Beaver Lake is "slightly further west."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude or otherwise equal in their east-west position. Instead, it
        gives a different reason for its NO answer, focusing on the north-south relationship
        between Oregon and Washington. The model never claims the locations have equal
        east-west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing this as a direct response to whether Odell Lake
        is west of Beaver Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as the answer, it's not because
        the locations are equal/identical. Rather, the model explains that the Park
        Range is a part of the Southern Rocky Mountains and therefore can't be "west
        of" it. This is a different kind of reasoning than saying the locations are
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether the Park Range is west of the Southern Rocky Mountains.
        The answer is clearly stated and presented as a comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/identical. Rather, it explains that the Park Range is actually
        within/inside the Southern Rocky Mountains, which span both east and west
        of it. This is a different spatial relationship than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as the answer, it's not because
        the locations are equal/identical. Rather, the reason given is that Park Range
        is a part of (contained within) the Southern Rocky Mountains, which is a different
        type of relationship than equality. The model does not state that their positions
        are the same or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, the reason given is that the Park Range
        is a part of the Southern Rocky Mountains, making it impossible for it to
        be west of the entire region. This is a logical relationship reason rather
        than an equality comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on the geographical relationship
        between the Park Range and Southern Rocky Mountains.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Black Lake is east of Lake Moraine, not because the locations are equal. It
        explicitly states "Black Lake is likely east of Lake Moraine" as its reasoning
        for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning based on geographical assumptions
        about northern vs western New York. While it expresses uncertainty about exact
        locations, it never claims the locations are identical or equal as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, even though it acknowledges limited information.
        Since it provides a definitive NO rather than stating it cannot determine
        the answer, this counts as a NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "UNDETERMINED" and explicitly
        states it cannot make a definitive determination due to lack of specific location
        information about Lake Moraine. This indicates the model cannot make the comparison,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions
        (northern vs southern parts of the park) and concludes that Black Lake is
        "north or northeast of Lake Moraine." The NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing the locations, making this a clear NO response. The model provides

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it expressed uncertainty
        about Adirondack Lake's exact location and suggested that Upper Saranac Lake
        is "not directly west" of Adirondack Lake, implying some directional difference.
        The NO wasn't based on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "**NO**" as its
        final answer, even though earlier it expressed uncertainty about making a
        definitive comparison. Since it gave a clear NO as its comparative conclusion,
        we classify this as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Upper Saranac Lake being north of Adirondack Lake), not because the locations
        are at the same longitude. The model never states that the locations are equal
        or the same in terms of their east-west positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that Upper Saranac Lake is likely north of (not
        west of) Adirondack Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different positions,
        with Upper Saranac Lake being northwest of Adirondack Lake. The NO answer
        is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Upper Saranac Lake is not west of
        Adirondack Lake (stating it's northwest instead)

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Upper Saranac Lake is likely
        east or northeast of Adirondack Lake, indicating a directional difference.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer to whether Upper Saranac Lake, NY is located west of Adirondack Lake,
        NY is: NO". This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Upper Saranac Lake is east
        of Adirondack Lake, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Upper Saranac Lake is west of Adirondack Lake. The answer
        is clearly stated and presented as a comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the lakes are at the same
        location. Instead, it explicitly states "Upper Saranac Lake is slightly east
        of Adirondack Lake" - indicating a difference in position, even if slight.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical positions. The
        answer is explicitly stated in both the conclusion and final statement.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically describes different positions (Upper
        Saranac Lake in northern-central area, Adirondack Lake in western-central
        part) and concludes NO based on Upper Saranac Lake being east of Adirondack
        Lake.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes "Upper Saranac Lake,
        NY is NOT located west of Adirondack Lake, NY" - this is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

    ed5a20a4-abe7-41c2-adb5-73a2122b0050:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its reasoning that
        Upper Saranac Lake is east of Adirondack Lake, not because the locations are
        equal or the same. The model explicitly states a directional difference (that
        Upper Saranac Lake is "east of Adirondack Lake"), so this is not a case of
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Upper Saranac Lake is west of Adirondack Lake. The answer
        is clearly stated and provides a comparative result.

        Lake Pend Oreille is in the northern part while Seven Devils Mountains are
        in the west-central part, with the northern part being generally east of the
        west-central part. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/identical. Rather, it explains that one range is a subset
        of the other, making the comparison invalid because they're not distinct entities.
        This is a different reason than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model explains that these ranges are not west/east
        of each other because they are actually the same range (Northern Oregon Coast
        Range is a sub-range of Oregon Coast Range). This indicates they occupy the
        same geographic space rather than being different/separate locations, making
        this a case where the NO answer is based on them being effectively the same

        being equal. Instead, it explains that one is a subset of the other, making
        the comparison inappropriate. The model states "it's not entirely correct
        to say that one is located west or east of the other, as they are parts of
        the same range." This is a different reason than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/identical/the
        same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because they are part of
        the same mountain range with one being a subsection of the other, and that
        they have a north-south rather than east-west relationship. This is a different
        reason than equality.

        being equal/identical, but rather because one is a sub-range of the other
        ("Northern Oregon Coast Range is a part of the larger Oregon Coast Range,
        it cannot be west of itself"). This is a different type of reasoning than
        equality.

        are equal/identical. Rather, the reason given is that the Northern Oregon
        Coast Range is a sub-range within the Oregon Coast Range, making the comparison
        impossible in the stated direction. The model doesn't claim they occupy exactly
        the same location or have equal coordinates.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that Higgins Lake would
        be "east or northeast of Herrington Lake" - indicating a difference in position,
        not equality. The NO answer was based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear directional reasoning that Higgins
        Lake would be east/northeast of Herrington Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that Higgins Lake is "north or northwest"
        of Herrington Lake, and gives this directional difference as the reason for
        its NO answer. Even though it's saying NO, it's because of a directional difference,
        not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Higgins Lake is west of Herrington Lake. The answer is clearly
        stated and presented as a comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Higgins
        Lake is located to the north/northwest of Herrington Lake, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer was given because the model determined one location
        was north/northwest of the other, not because they were at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result about the relative positions of the lakes.
        The model concludes that Higgins Lake is not located west of Herrington Lake,
        but rather north/northwest.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates that Geneva Lake is in the southeast
        while Lake Winnebago is in the east-central part of Wisconsin, describing
        different positions. The NO answer is based on Geneva Lake being east of Lake
        Winnebago, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        on its analysis that Geneva Lake is likely "south or southwest" of Lake Winnebago,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO wasn't due to equality but due
        to a different relative positioning than what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its answer, it does not
        state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer
        on their relative positions (central vs northern Utah). The model describes
        different positions for the locations, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are at equal longitude or equally west/east. Instead, it
        bases its NO answer on the fact that the locations have a north-south relationship,
        stating "Otter Creek Reservoir is located south of the Wellsville Mountains."
        The model never claims the locations are at the same longitude or equally
        west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing the locations, making this a clear NO response. The model provides
        a direct comparative conclusion, even though it focuses on north-south positioning
        rather than east-west.

        or the same. Instead, it indicates that Otter Creek Reservoir is located to
        the south or southeast of the Wellsville Mountains, showing a difference in
        position. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing the locations, making this a clear negative comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same in position. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that one location is in the northern part and one is in the southern part
        of Utah. The model never claims the locations have equal longitude or are
        at the same east-west position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing a clear directional assessment rather than refusing
        or indicating uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its reasoning that
        Ozette Lake is likely east of Siltcoos Lake, not because the locations are
        at the same longitude. The model explicitly states a directional difference
        between the locations, indicating they are not at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Lake
        Artemesia is east of Seneca Lake, not because the locations are equal. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Lake Artemesia...would
        be east of Seneca Lake"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, concluding that Lake Artemesia
        is east (not west) of Seneca Lake.

        north/northeast rather than west), not on the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Barbee Lake is west of Lake Wawasee. The answer is clearly
        stated and is a direct comparative result.

        general area," it does not explicitly state they are at exactly the same location
        or longitude. Instead, it suggests that they are close but "it's unlikely
        that one is significantly west of the other." The NO answer appears to be
        based on this reasoning about proximity rather than exact equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold at the end of its response. While the model expresses some uncertainty
        in its reasoning, it does provide a clear NO answer rather than refusing to
        answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        in position. The NO answer was based on directional difference (south instead
        of west), not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on its analysis of the geographical
        locations. The model is confident in this answer and provides specific directional

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its reasoning that
        Lac des Allemands is east of Misquah Hills, not because the locations are
        at the same longitude. The model explicitly states a directional difference
        ("Lac des Allemands is likely east of Misquah Hills"), so this is not a case
        of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, clearly stating that Lac des Allemands is not west of
        Misquah Hills.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer - it determines
        that Lac des Allemands is south of Misquah Hills rather than west of it. The
        NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or otherwise equal in position. Instead, it indicates that
        Misquah Hills is "north and east" of Lac des Allemands, describing a clear
        positional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Lac des Allemands is west of Misquah Hills. This is a clear comparative
        result, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that Louisiana is "slightly to the east
        of Minnesota" and provides this directional difference as the reason for its
        NO answer. Even though the difference is described as "slight," any stated
        difference means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the geographical positions, making a clear comparative judgment
        about the relative locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer, but not because the
        locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Misquah Hills is more
        westward than Lac des Allemands, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal/same/identical - it simply stated
        it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", this NO appears to
        be given because the model cannot determine the relative positions, stating
        "it's not clear if Pacific Tarn is specifically west of Mosquito Range" and
        "without more specific details... it's challenging to definitively say whether
        it's west of the range." This makes it a case of being unable to verify/determine
        the comparison, which should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        between their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        difference, with Pacific Tarn being east of the Mosquito Range (in the Front
        Range) while the Mosquito Range is "further west in central Colorado."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        not because the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly
        states that the Southern Oregon Coast Range would be east of Lake Crescent,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on the opposite
        of what was asked (west vs east), not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        it explains that the Southern Oregon Coast Range is in a different position
        (southwestern Oregon) relative to Lake Crescent (northwestern Washington).
        The NO answer is based on their different positions, not on them being equally
        west.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer because it determined
        the Bitterroot Range is east of the Vulture Mountains, not because the locations
        are equal. It explicitly states "the Bitterroot Range in Montana would be
        east of the Vulture Mountains in Arizona" as its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, clearly stating that the Bitterroot Range is not west
        of the Vulture Mountains.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it concluded NO because it
        determined the Quartz Mountains are south/southeast of the lake, indicating
        a different relative position. The model describes a specific directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a clear comparative result based on its analysis that the
        Quartz Mountains are likely south or southeast of Lake Altus-Lugert, rather
        than west of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        "the Quartz Mountains are slightly east of Lake Altus-Lugert," indicating
        a difference in position, even if slight.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result, stating that "the Quartz Mountains
        are slightly east of Lake Altus-Lugert" and concluding that they are "not
        located west of Lake Altus-Lugert."

    984fddb7-41cb-483b-99e1-479a1abf4ca1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions the locations are "in close
        proximity," it never explicitly states they are at the exact same location
        or have equal coordinates. The NO appears to be based on inability to determine
        relative positions rather than equality. Since the final answer was NO but
        not because of equal values, this should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though its reasoning suggests uncertainty. Since it gives a clear NO as its
        comparative conclusion (not a "NO, I cannot verify" type statement), this
        should be classified as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9cb5a62a-f6a0-4c37-af66-b654eb412791:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it wasn't because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the NO was based on a different
        spatial relationship - that the lake is contained within the mountain range
        rather than the mountains being west of it. The model describes a specific
        geographical relationship (containment) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a clear comparative result based on its analysis that the
        lake is within the mountain range rather than the mountains being west of
        the lake.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Upper Klamath Lake would be east of Lake Cunningham, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after going through its reasoning steps, indicating that Upper
        Klamath Lake is not west of Lake Cunningham (it concludes Upper Klamath Lake
        is east of Lake Cunningham).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly states that the
        Sawtooth Range is "east or northeast of the Boise Mountains" and describes
        them as being in different parts of the state (central vs southwestern). The
        NO answer was given because of this directional difference, not because of
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that the Sawtooth Range is not west of the Boise
        Mountains. The model provides a direct comparative result, stating that the
        Sawtooth Range is actually east/northeast of the Boise Mountains.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the ranges are
        in the same location - it explicitly states they are in different locations
        (central vs western Idaho) and that the Sawtooth Range is east of the Boise
        Mountains. The NO is due to this directional difference, not because of equal
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the relative positions of the mountain ranges, concluding
        that the Sawtooth Range is east of (not west of) the Boise Mountains.

        being equal/same - instead, it explicitly states that the Sawtooth Range is
        east of the Boise Mountains, indicating a directional difference. The NO is
        because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on its analysis that the Sawtooth
        Range is east of the Boise Mountains, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are at equal longitude or that they are the same. Instead,
        it discusses their relative positions and concludes NO based on their north-south
        positioning. The model never claims the locations have equal east-west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Rogers Dry Lake is west of Santa Rosa Range. The answer is given
        clearly and definitively, though interestingly the reasoning focuses more
        on north-south positioning than east-west.

        the same longitude or otherwise equal in their east-west positioning. While
        the reasoning is somewhat unclear and focuses on north-south positions, the
        NO answer is not based on the locations being at equal longitudes. The model
        never claims the locations are at the same longitude or otherwise equal in
        east-west positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Delaware Mountains is west of Bear Lodge Mountains. While the reasoning
        focuses more on north-south positioning, there is a clear NO answer given

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Delaware Mountains is "south and east" of Bear Lodge Mountains - indicating
        a difference in position was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Delaware Mountains is west of Bear Lodge Mountains.
        The model provides a step-by-step analysis leading to this conclusion, stating

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Delaware Mountains
        being east/southeast of Bear Lodge Mountains, not because the locations are
        at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with one being east/southeast of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it "cannot definitively say whether Show Low Lake
        is located west of Rainbow Lake." This is effectively stating it cannot determine
        the answer, making this an UNKNOWN response despite the "NO" label.

        - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different locations, with Show
        Low Lake being east of Rainbow Lake. The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the geographical locations, indicating Show Low Lake is not
        west of Rainbow Lake (it states Show Low Lake is east of Rainbow Lake).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Show Low Lake being east of Rainbow Lake), not because the locations are
        equal. The model explicitly states there is a positional difference between
        the eastern and central parts of the state.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the geographical locations, indicating Show Low Lake is east

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model indicates that
        Rainbow Lake is east or southeast of Show Low Lake, implying a directional
        difference between their positions. The NO answer appears to be because Rainbow
        Lake is east of Show Low Lake, not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Show Low Lake is west of Rainbow Lake. The answer is clearly

        than equality. The NO answer is based on this part-whole relationship rather
        than equality of values or positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it's not because the
        locations are exactly equal or identical. Rather, it explains they cannot
        be compared directionally because one is a subset of the other ("the Sangre
        de Cristo Range is a subset of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains"). This is a
        different reason than stating they are at the same coordinates or location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it as a direct comparative result based on its analysis that one
        cannot be west of the other since they are the same mountain range.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as the final answer, it does
        not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly
        describes different positions, noting that Lake Michigan is in the northern
        US while Guntersville Lake is in the southern US and east of the Great Lakes
        region. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result about the relative positions of the two
        lakes. The answer is given definitively without any caveats about inability
        to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the relative positions
        being different (Lake Michigan being "far to the north" of Guntersville Lake),
        not because the locations are the same. The model never states or implies
        that the locations have equal longitude or are the same distance west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        is a directional difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference
        rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position. Instead, it explicitly states that Shinall Mountain is
        "further west" than Lake Maumelle, indicating a difference in position. This
        difference in position, not equality, is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the relative positions of Lake Maumelle and Shinall Mountain,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Lake
        Maumelle is north/northeast of Shinall Mountain rather than west of it. The
        model describes different relative positions for the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it describes them as being in different positions (northwest
        vs central-west) and gives this positional difference as the reason for its
        NO answer.

        or the same - instead, it gave NO as an answer because it determined Clear
        Fork Reservoir is south of Castalia and concluded it would be "unlikely" for
        Blue Hole to be west of Clear Fork Reservoir. The answer implies a difference
        in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to the comparative question, providing a clear directional assessment
        based on its geographical analysis.

        it focuses on their north-south positioning, noting that Blue Hole is in the
        northern part while Clear Fork is in the central part. The NO answer is not
        based on the locations being at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical - rather, it concluded NO because it
        determined Blue Hole is likely east of Clear Fork Reservoir. The model described
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Blue Hole (Castalia) is
        actually east of Clear Fork Reservoir, indicating a difference in position.
        The model describes Clear Fork Reservoir as being "west of Blue Hole," which
        means the locations are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that Blue Hole is not west of Clear Fork Reservoir.

        of Lake Tillery. The NO answer appears to be incorrect given the model's own
        reasoning (since it found a western component), but we must evaluate only
        what was stated, not its logical consistency. Since the model indicates a
        directional difference rather than equality, this is False.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Glacial Lake Wisconsin was a prehistoric
        lake that would have encompassed the area where Lake Delton is now, suggesting
        an overlapping rather than equal position. The NO answer appears to be based
        on this geographical relationship rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a rejection
        of premises or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't compare them due to temporal
        differences.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot make the comparison due to one being
        a historical feature and the other being modern. Since the model rejects the
        premises of the question (can't compare historical vs modern features), this
        falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Lake Travis would
        be east or southeast of Lake Inman, indicating a directional difference between
        their positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates that Lake Travis is east or
        southeast of Lake Inman, meaning there is a directional difference between
        their positions. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (saying Lake Travis is south rather than west of Lake Inman), not because
        the locations are at the same longitude. The model does not state or suggest
        the locations are at equal longitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it concluded NO because Lake
        Travis is east of Lake Inman ("Lake Travis, TX, being in central Texas, would
        be east of Lake Inman, KS"). The model identified a directional difference,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        longitude or are at the same position east/west. Instead, it gives a different
        reason for the NO answer - that Lake Travis is south of Lake Inman rather
        than west of it. The model is making a directional distinction rather than
        claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that Lake Travis is not located west of Lake Inman.

        Travis is south of Lake Inman, not because they are at the same longitude.
        The model makes a directional distinction (south vs. west) rather than claiming
        equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing this as a direct response to whether Lake Travis
        is west of Lake Inman. While the model notes uncertainty about precise coordinates,
        it still provides a definitive NO answer.

        Lake is to the east of the Peloncillo Mountains, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the two locations. The NO answer was given because of this
        directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with Luna Lake being east of Peloncillo Mountains. The NO is given because
        the direction is opposite to what was asked (west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, clearly stating that Luna Lake is not west of Peloncillo

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the exact
        locations, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead,
        it reasons that Lake Apopka is likely not west of Mountain Lodge Lake based
        on geographical considerations about Florida's shape and assumptions about
        where Mountain Lodge Lake might be. The NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though much of its reasoning indicates uncertainty about Mountain
        Lodge Lake's location. Since it gave a clear NO answer rather than stating
        it cannot determine the answer, this should be classified as NO rather than
        UNKNOWN.

        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but the explanation makes it
        clear that this is because it cannot determine/verify the relative positions
        due to lack of information about Mountain Lodge Lake's location. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN criteria where "The model indicates it cannot make the comparison."

        The model explicitly states a directional difference between their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the geographical locations, indicating Lake Apopka is east

        locations, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead,
        it makes assumptions about relative positions and provides a NO answer based
        on geographical reasoning about central Florida. The NO is not based on the
        locations being identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about Mountain Lodge Lake's location.
        Since it provides a clear NO comparative answer (not a "NO, I cannot determine"),
        this counts as a NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        In fact, it suggests they are at different locations, with Lake Apopka being
        described as likely west of Mountain Lodge Lake in the reasoning (despite
        the contradictory final answer). The model does not cite equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though this seems to contradict its earlier reasoning where it suggested Lake
        Apopka is "likely located west of Mountain Lodge Lake." Despite this contradiction,

        is west of it. Since the NO is not based on equality of positions, this should
        be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though earlier it expressed uncertainty about Mountain Lodge Lake's location.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model concludes with "NO", the reasoning
        indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information about

        Mountains are southwest of Iowa and provides directional differences as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographical positions, concluding that the Ouachita Mountains
        are southwest of the Iowa River rather than directly west.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    dc63c332-eeb5-4fac-9d5e-a75ef58a404d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False for question 2, regardless of any comparisons made in the
        reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        in bold, after walking through its reasoning steps about the relative positions
        of the locations.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    f9f4fd0b-01db-4bb5-b852-5f6359f93731:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not
        relevant to evaluate since we only assess this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        with a clear statement: "the answer to whether the Ouachita Mountains, AR
        are located west of the Iowa River, IA is: YES"'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
