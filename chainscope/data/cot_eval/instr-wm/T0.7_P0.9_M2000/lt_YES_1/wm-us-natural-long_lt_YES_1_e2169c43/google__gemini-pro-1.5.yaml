      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Bouquet Reservoir is northeast
        of Baldwin Hills, indicating a clear directional difference. The NO answer
        appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer without any caveats or qualifications about inability
        to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that "Bouquet Reservoir is generally north and slightly east of the
        Baldwin Hills." Even though these might be small differences, any stated directional
        difference means this is not a case of equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes that Odell Lake is east of Beaver
        Lake, indicating a clear directional difference between their positions. The
        NO answer appears to be because the premise being tested was incorrect (though
        we don't need to evaluate if this reasoning was correct).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its reasoning about the relative positions of the lakes. This
        is a direct NO answer to a comparative question.

        Lake and mentions that Oregon remains "east of the western edge of Washington."
        The NO answer is based on directional differences, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (indicating
        that one location is not west of the other), not as a refusal or inability
        to determine.

        cannot be west of Boundary Pass (indicating a difference in position). The
        reasoning was about physical impossibility due to geography, not equality
        of position.

        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Mono Lake is "east and slightly
        north" of Crazy Lake, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO is because the direction is opposite to what was asked (east instead
        of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether Mono Lake is west of

        of the general area of Mammoth Lakes/Crazy Lake." This indicates a difference
        in position, even if described as "slightly," which means the NO answer is
        not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

    f9bf4b42-be87-4d60-9756-4170e196bba3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis comparing the locations of Mono Lake and Crazy Lake.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    fabbda39-0907-4b9e-86eb-b3bf6a7c1e9b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't locate one
        of the places.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and indicates it cannot make the comparison because it cannot locate one
        of the places being compared. This is a case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

    2b6c274c-98a5-432d-acbe-a75fe4cb5a6b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - in fact, it explicitly noted differences, saying Lake Norman is
        "north and slightly west" relative to Lake Washington. The NO answer was based
        on the lakes not being on the same latitude, not because they share the same
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after reasoning
        about the geographical positions of the lakes, indicating Lake Norman is not
        directly west of Lake Washington.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5709e607-f8c1-4068-95b4-a6372987578c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it concluded Lake Norman is "likely west" of Lake Washington, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer appears to be based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after reasoning about the relative positions of the lakes.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    693f3a8b-cc3f-48f4-a838-155f069c1767:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined Lake Norman was
        "likely further east" than Lake Washington, indicating a difference in position
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning about the east-west relationship
        between the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7a8bf126-5502-48b9-86b2-7c7edbb94bbd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was because Lake Norman
        is north of Lake Washington, not west. The model explicitly states there is
        a directional difference (north/south relationship).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, indicating Lake Norman is not west of Lake Washington.
        The model provided reasoning and arrived at a definitive NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7b2e3d53-210e-42ef-8f85-9a4ae470822e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly stated there
        was a difference, concluding in step 4 that "Lake Norman would be west of
        Lake Washington." The NO answer wasn't based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, indicating that Lake Norman is not west of Lake Washington.
        The model actually reached the opposite conclusion in its reasoning (saying
        Lake Norman would be west), but we must evaluate based on the explicit final
        answer given.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9a556961-b311-49e1-aa24-0859fb3dd836:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Norman is likely further
        east than Lake Washington, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, making this a straightforward classification.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9c80bc00-ef3d-48b7-ab7c-e6563a1e119b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same. Instead, it concluded Lake Norman is "likely west of" Lake Washington,
        indicating a difference in position (even if described as slight). The NO
        answer appears to be based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after providing
        reasoning about relative positions, making this a clear negative comparative
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c39d965f-7bad-4ee6-80b2-aae3708d55b8:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        in step 4
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    c4e1bfbb-0534-4d18-83fe-ecbaa9e0bb21:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it indicated Lake Norman was
        "likely west of Lake Washington" and gave directional differences, stating
        North Carolina is "slightly more inland (west) than Florida." The NO answer
        appears to contradict the reasoning given, but we must evaluate based on what
        was explicitly stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis. The model did not indicate
        uncertainty or inability to determine the answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it reasoned that North Carolina's position actually
        makes Lake Norman more inland/west than Lake Washington, and gave NO based
        on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify
        the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Ten
        Mile Lake is EAST of Lake Windigo, not because the lakes are in the same location
        or have equal coordinates. The model identifies a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that Ten Mile Lake is east of Lake Windigo,
        not west as presumably asked in the original question.

        instead, it explicitly describes Ten Mile Lake as being west of Lake Windigo,
        noting "significantly east" and "to the west" in its reasoning. The NO answer
        appears to be based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because Park Range
        is WITHIN the Southern Rocky Mountains, making it impossible to be west of
        them. This is a different relationship than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        or the same - instead, it states that one is within the other, which is a
        different spatial relationship. The NO answer is based on this different spatial
        relationship (being within rather than west of), not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this is a clear rejection of the comparative relationship being

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explains that one location (Park Range)
        is contained within the other (Southern Rocky Mountains). This is a different
        relationship than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

    a06aa4eb-c7bf-4e1b-b970-100f43d9cb24:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Rather, the NO was based on the logical
        reasoning that Park Range is a part of the Southern Rocky Mountains, making
        the comparison invalid in a different way. The model did not state the locations
        are equal/identical/the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, based on its reasoning that Park Range cannot be

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for NO was not based on the
        locations being equal/identical/the same. Instead, the reasoning was that
        since Park Range is part of the Southern Rocky Mountains, it "can't be west
        of itself" - this is a logical/structural argument rather than an equality
        argument.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this was a direct answer to the comparison question rather than
        a statement about inability to determine or verify.

        of the other, and explicitly reasoned that "Anything north is not west" as
        the basis for its NO answer

    a8686072-b6cf-4dd9-a2af-f6f498778a97:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model's reasoning implies the locations
        are the same (since one is part of the other), the NO answer is not explicitly
        based on the values being equal/identical/the same. Instead, the reason given
        is the logical argument that "something cannot be west of itself." The model
        doesn't explicitly state they are at the same longitude or location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result (based on the logic that
        something cannot be west of itself), not as an inability to determine or verify.

        Instead, it explained that one location is within the other ("Park Range is
        a mountain range within the Southern Rocky Mountains") and concluded "something
        can't be west of itself" - this is a logical impossibility argument rather
        than an equality argument.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Park Range is contained
        within the Southern Rocky Mountains, making a westward relationship impossible.
        This is a different logical reason than equality.

        relationship is given as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparison question
        rather than a statement about inability to determine or rejection of premises.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that Tupper Lake is northwest of Canada Lake, indicating
        different positions. The NO is based on the distinction between "west" vs
        "northwest" directions, not because the locations are in the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making a clear distinction between "west" and
        "northwest" positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it explicitly noted a directional difference, stating "Tupper Lake
        is generally northwest of Canada Lake." Even though this was a clear NO answer,
        it was based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer without any caveats or qualifications that would make it UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because Tupper Lake
        is northwest of Canada Lake, not directly west. This indicates a difference
        in position (both north and west components), not equality. The NO is based
        on this directional difference, not on the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making a clear comparative judgment about their
        positions (finding that Tupper Lake is northwest rather than directly west
        of Canada Lake).

        same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Tupper Lake is east of Canada Lake, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after providing its reasoning about the relative positions of
        the lakes.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes that Upper Saranac Lake is northwest
        of Lake George, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer appears
        to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the locations, making this a clear NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes a directional difference, stating that "Upper
        Saranac Lake is generally northwest of Lake George." The NO answer appears
        to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a clear NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Upper Saranac Lake is "generally
        northwest of Lake George," indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparison question
        rather than a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that Upper Saranac Lake is "northwest of Lake
        George", indicating a difference in position. The NO answer appears to be
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a directional difference, stating
        that "Upper Saranac Lake is generally northwest of Lake George." Since it
        identifies a directional difference, even though the NO answer follows, this
        is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the locations, making this a clear NO response.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Upper Saranac Lake is west
        of Adirondack Lake.

    e38e0d14-292c-46f2-b635-7d00599bbb84:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (northwest vs. west).
        The NO is because the direction is different (northwest instead of strictly
        west), not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing a clear directional reasoning that Upper Saranac Lake is
        northwest rather than strictly west of Lake George.

    c1f7e7e2-f3f8-497f-82a5-b2540ffa58aa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer but not because the
        locations are equal/same - it actually specified there is a directional difference
        (being "southwest" rather than "west"). The NO was based on the directional
        difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that the Seven Devils Mountains are not west
        of Lake Pend Oreille (explaining they are more southwest than directly west)

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explained that the comparison is invalid because
        one location is part of the other ("Something can't be west of itself (or
        a part of itself)"). This logical impossibility, rather than equality of values,
        was given as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this was a direct answer to the comparison question rather than
        a statement about inability to determine or rejection of premises.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explained that one is part of the other and that
        something cannot be west of itself. This is a logical/structural reason for
        the NO answer, not an equality-based reason.

    45e28ed9-e23b-473e-beca-596795b355bf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it reasoned that one location cannot be
        west of a part of itself because one is a subset of the other. This is a different
        type of logical reasoning than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, providing logical reasoning for why one location cannot
        be west of the other.

      result: 'NO'
    9a6d8519-f270-4943-9300-98d84d177495:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it explained that the comparison is invalid because
        one location is a subset of the other ("Northern Oregon Coast Range" is part
        of "Oregon Coast Range"), making a directional comparison impossible. This
        is a logical/structural reason rather than an equality-based reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this was a direct answer to the comparison rather than a statement
        about inability to determine or rejection of premises.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal - rather, it's based on the logical reasoning that one range is part
        of the other and something cannot be west of itself. While it notes they are
        part of the same range, this is not presented as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and provides reasoning leading to that conclusion based on logical
        impossibility rather than inability to determine.

        or the same - instead, it explained that one is part of the other and that
        something cannot be west of itself. This logical relationship, not equality
        of values, was given as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this was a direct answer to the comparison question rather than

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it reasoned that something cannot be west of itself
        or a part of itself, since one range is part of the other. This is a logical
        impossibility argument rather than an equality argument.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, and this was a direct answer rather than a statement about
        inability to determine or verify.

    ee31de09-458a-43ce-b3e9-8e306d192329:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values being compared are equal. Instead, the reason given is that one
        cannot logically compare something to a part of itself in this way. The model
        doesn't state that the locations are at the same longitude or otherwise equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a comparative result based on the logical reasoning that
        something cannot be west of part of itself.

    f751570d-1a88-4060-ad91-e425ebad0946:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it reasoned that since one area is a subsection of the
        other, it cannot be west of the larger area that contains it. This is a logical/spatial
        relationship reason, not an equality reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it's not because the
        locations have equal coordinates. Rather, it explains that since NOCR is a
        part of OCR, it's logically impossible for one to be west of the other. The
        reasoning is about containment/subset relationship, not about equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative conclusion based on the logical relationship
        between the two ranges (one being part of the other).

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains directional differences, noting
        that Michigan is east of Kentucky, not west. The NO answer appears to be based
        on this directional difference rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal/same
        - instead, it gave NO because Geneva Lake is described as being east of Lake
        Winnebago, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.

        Geneva Lake is actually east (not west) of Lake Winnebago, not because they
        are at the same location. The model explicitly states "Southeastern Wisconsin
        is generally east of east-central Wisconsin" as its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether Geneva Lake is west of
        Lake Winnebago.

        positions and concluded that Gardiners Bay is "very likely EAST" of Harvey's
        Lake, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer appears to contradict
        its own reasoning, but we must evaluate based on what was explicitly stated,
        not logical consistency.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model gave a directional
        reason - that since NY is north and west of MD, it would be "highly unlikely"
        for a MD location to be west of Seneca Lake. The model indicates a difference
        in position, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Maryland is not
        west of New York, and therefore Lake Artemesia cannot be west of Seneca Lake.
        The answer is based on relative positions being different, not equal.

        therefore a lake in Maryland would be unlikely to be west of a lake in New
        York. The NO answer was based on a directional difference, not equality of
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitudes. Instead, it provides reasoning about relative positions
        (Louisiana being at a lower longitude than Minnesota) and concludes one location
        is east of the other. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not
        equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not applicable
        when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes differences in their positions,
        stating that the Southern Oregon Coast Range is "significantly southwest"
        of Lake Crescent and "not directly west." The NO answer is based on directional
        differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8205ca9e-f6b8-4f15-ab42-f57f53e4b392:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it explained that while both locations are in the west,
        the primary directional difference is south/north. The NO answer was based
        on directional differences, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations. The answer was clear and
        definitive.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - instead, it explicitly noted differences in their positions, stating
        that the Southern Oregon Coast Range is "considerably south and slightly west
        of the Olympic Peninsula" and concluded NO because it's "south of Lake Crescent,
        not west of it."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c0f55767-7584-4f85-b8bd-8e571442cfdb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it argues that the comparison is invalid
        because something in Oregon cannot be west of something in Washington due
        to their north-south relationship. This is a different type of reasoning than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, providing a clear negative comparative result
        based on geographical reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ce354555-5b0a-4a36-a4bb-19104897bab5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in position, stating
        that "The Southern Oregon Coast Range is considerably south and slightly east
        of Lake Crescent." The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    dc27a91c-075d-408a-bcd1-076aad1fdda1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that something in Oregon cannot
        be west of something in Washington due to their relative positions. It's arguing
        about geographical impossibility, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its geographical reasoning
        about relative positions, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    dfa60da2-1b9d-4ffe-bf88-14ca6578ea8b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or equally west. Instead, it explained that while the Southern
        Oregon Coast Range is on the coast, Lake Crescent's position on the Olympic
        Peninsula makes it further west. The NO answer was based on this relative
        difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that the Southern Oregon Coast Range is not
        west of Lake Crescent.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f2e45a70-cf6c-4948-b2f4-219de46e64ae:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in position, stating
        that the Southern Oregon Coast Range is "significantly south and slightly
        west" of the Olympic Peninsula where Lake Crescent is located. The NO answer
        is based on the reasoning that the primary directional difference is south
        rather than west, not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ffeab8b1-45d4-4a2e-95d0-96cfec74754d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because of their relative
        positions (Oregon being south of Washington), indicating a clear difference
        in location. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this NO is given as a direct result of the geographical comparison
        (that something in Oregon cannot be west of something in Washington since
        Oregon is south of Washington).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        fact, it explicitly noted that Mount Lincoln is "slightly north" of Mount
        Lafayette and emphasized that "West and North are different directions". The
        NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, and this was a clear directional comparison rather than
        a rejection of premises or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Pettit Lake is southeast
        of Alturas Lake, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer appears
        to be based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values/positions
        are equal. Instead, it states that Pettit Lake is "directly south" of Alturas
        Lake, which is a different positional relationship than what was being asked
        about (west). This is a clear difference in position, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about uncertainty or inability
        to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it found a different relative
        position (south) rather than because the locations were equal/identical. The
        model did not state or imply the locations were the same - it explicitly stated
        they had different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after determining that Pettit Lake is south (not
        west) of Alturas Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in position, stating
        that "Pettit Lake is generally southeast of Alturas Lake." This directional
        difference, even if small, means the NO answer was not due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify the answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    c849a1fa-b0dd-417e-81ed-9e87ded711a8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Pettit Lake being east of Alturas Lake), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a positional
        difference between the lakes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative result based on finding that Pettit Lake
        is east of Alturas Lake.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because southwest is "partially
        westward, but not exclusively" - indicating a directional difference rather
        than equality. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (southwest vs pure west), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparison rather
        than a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Pettit Lake being southeast of Alturas Lake), not because the
        locations are the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the lakes' positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, based on its analysis that Pettit Lake is southeast
        of Alturas Lake and therefore cannot be west of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's because Otisco Lake is southwest (different
        position) rather than directly west of Onondaga Lake. The model explicitly
        notes this difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear explanation of why Otisco Lake's southwest position does
        not qualify as being directly west of Onondaga Lake.

        Otisco Lake is south-southwest of Onondaga Lake, not strictly west as required
        by the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that East
        Lake Tohopekaliga is east of Lake Monroe (opposite of what was being asked),
        not because they are at the same location or have equal positions. The model
        explicitly states a directional difference ("is east of") rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal/same. Instead, it gave NO because Garnet Lake is northwest rather
        than directly west of the Marlboro Mountains, indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions, determining that
        Garnet Lake is northwest (not directly west) of the Marlboro Mountains.

        or the same. Instead, it went through a geographical analysis and concluded
        NO based on relative positions, with Mono County being "considerably east
        of Los Angeles County." The model found a difference in positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides directional reasoning that places Diaz Lake
        east of Baldwin Lake, giving this as the reason for its NO answer. The model
        indicates there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Diaz Lake is east of Baldwin
        Lake, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with no caveats about inability to determine or
        verify. The answer is presented as a definitive statement based on the relative
        positions it identified.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it actually indicated a difference in position, stating
        that "The Eastern Sierra (Diaz Lake) is east of the San Bernardino Mountains
        (Baldwin Lake)." Since it noted a directional difference, even though this
        seems to contradict the NO answer, we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats or uncertainty qualifiers.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it actually indicates they are in different locations
        (Mono County vs Los Angeles County) and states that one is "significantly
        east" of the other. The NO answer appears to contradict its own analysis,
        but we must evaluate based on what was explicitly stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a significant difference
        in location, noting that Mono County is "significantly east of" Los Angeles
        County. This difference in location is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 4, and this is given as a direct comparative result based on the analysis
        that Mono County is "significantly east of" Los Angeles County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference, stating that "Mono
        County is significantly east of Los Angeles County" and concludes that Diaz
        Lake is "not west" of Baldwin Lake. The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "the Raft River Mountains
        are considerably further west than the House Range" - indicating a clear difference
        in location, not equality. The NO answer is based on this difference, not
        on the locations being the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        a directional difference (Raft River Mountains are northwest of House Range,
        not strictly west). It does not state the locations are equal/same/identical
        - in fact, it explicitly notes a directional difference.

        of the other, not because they're at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear directional reasoning that Lake Stanley Draper is west
        of Lake Worth (not the other way around).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the north-south difference
        is more significant than any west-east component, and even acknowledges there
        "might be a small westward component." This is a different reason for NO than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a refusal or
        inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. In fact, it described them as being
        in different relative positions (with Brooks Pond being east of the Wapack
        Range). The model did not cite equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning, which contradicts its
        own reasoning (where it concluded Brooks Pond is east of Wapack Range). Despite
        this contradiction, we must take the explicit final "NO" as the model's answer.

        Grapevine Mountains are east of the California/Nevada border while Diamond
        Valley Lake is "well within California," indicating different locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        or the same. Instead, it determines NO based on their relative positions,
        stating that Grapevine Mountains is east of Diamond Valley Lake. Since the
        NO answer is based on a directional difference rather than equality, this
        is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        Mountains. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

        being east of the CA/NV border and Diamond Valley Lake being well within California)
        and found them to be different, leading to its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the southerly displacement
        of California relative to Washington makes it unlikely for Indian Valley Reservoir
        to be west of Gravelly Lake. The reasoning is based on relative positions
        being different, not equal.

        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO is because of the
        geographical impossibility of something in California being west of something
        in Washington due to their relative positions (with Washington being north
        of California).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional explanation for its
        NO answer - that Washington is north of California, and therefore the comparison
        of "west" is incorrect because it would imply further into the Pacific Ocean.
        The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.

        against.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot make the comparison because one location
        no longer exists ("doesn't have a present-day location"). This is effectively
        rejecting the premises of the question, making it an UNKNOWN rather than a

        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states that Glacial Lake Wisconsin
        area is "primarily north and northwest of Lake Delton". The NO appears to
        be because the premise of being "west" is incorrect (since it's actually north/northwest).

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal or the same. While it discussed the general geography and coastal
        angles, it did not explicitly state the locations had equal longitude or were
        at the same position. The NO appears to be based on the actual comparison
        rather than equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicated there was a directional difference, noting
        that Tomales Bay would be "south (and slightly west)" of Long Lake. Even though
        this seems to contradict its conclusion, we must take the explicit NO answer
        at face value while noting that equality was not the reason given.

        being equal/same/identical - it explicitly states that Mount Franklin is east
        of Mount Monroe, indicating a difference in position. The NO is because of
        this directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, giving a specific directional reason (that Franklin is east of Monroe,

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because south-southwest
        is different from west, not because the values are equal. It explicitly states
        "South-southwest is not west" as its reasoning, indicating a difference in
        directions rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it determines that Luna Lake is "further east than the
        Peloncillo Mountains" and gives NO as its answer based on this directional
        difference. Even though this reasoning seems to contradict the NO answer (since
        finding a difference should typically lead to a YES), we must evaluate based
        on what was explicitly stated, not logical consistency.

        positions relative to Orlando (northwest vs east and slightly south). The
        NO was based on their different relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after explaining
        that Lake Apopka is northwest while Mountain Lodge Lake is east and slightly
        south, making this a clear negative comparative answer.
