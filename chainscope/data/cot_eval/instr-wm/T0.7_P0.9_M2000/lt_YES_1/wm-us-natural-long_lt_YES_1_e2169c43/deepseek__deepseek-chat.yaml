      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Bouquet Reservoir is northeast of Baldwin Hills, indicating a directional
        difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the geographical positions, indicating Bouquet Reservoir is
        not west of Baldwin Hills (specifically stating it is northeast instead).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Bouquet Reservoir being northeast of Baldwin Hills), not because the locations
        are at the same longitude. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" after

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (southwest vs. west), not because the locations are equal. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying "Spirit
        Lake is southwest of Phantom Lake, not west of it."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, based on finding that Spirit Lake is southwest
        (not purely west) of Phantom Lake.

        Bridger Range is "north and slightly east" of the Teton Range, not because
        the ranges are in the same location. The model explicitly states a directional
        difference (east vs west), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        the Bridger Range is "east of the Teton Range," not because the ranges are
        in the same location. It explicitly states a directional difference (Bridger
        Range is "to the north and slightly east"), so this is not a case of equal

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions
        (one is inland in Oregon, the other is in northwestern Washington) and uses
        this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions of the
        two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b8b4df14-f1b3-436c-8cfc-9385ad03e410:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal. While it notes they are "roughly at the same longitude," it explicitly
        states that Henry Hagg Lake is "slightly east of Boundary Pass" - indicating
        a difference, even if small. This directional difference, not equality, is
        the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        conclusion and once as the final answer. This is an explicit NO comparative
        result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d9d129e2-9742-4a96-9ec6-4a035d72c9e2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Henry Hagg Lake is "south
        and east" of Boundary Pass. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" and provides
        a direct comparative result, indicating that Henry Hagg Lake is not west of
        Boundary Pass because it is "to the south and east of Boundary Pass".'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it stated one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because one of the locations (Crazy Lake) doesn't exist. When a model
        rejects the premises of the question by stating one of the comparison points
        doesn't exist, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it stated one location couldn't be found to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but explicitly states
        this is because one location (Crazy Lake) doesn't appear to exist and therefore
        the comparison is impossible. When a model rejects the premises of the question
        by stating one element doesn't exist, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated one location
        couldn't be verified.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot be answered definitively"
        and then gives a NO answer based on lack of evidence rather than an actual
        comparison. Since the model rejects the premise by indicating one location
        cannot be verified, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        NO), this automatically results in False. The model didn't make the comparison
        at all due to one location not existing, rather than comparing equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because one location doesn't exist, making the comparison impossible.
        This is a case of rejecting the premises of the question, which falls under
        the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies this
        is due to being unable to determine/verify the comparison because one location
        (Crazy Lake) cannot be found. This falls under the criteria for UNKNOWN where

        the Oregon Coast Range"). This is a different type of relationship than equality.

        - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference (that one
        is south of the other, not west). The model is arguing against one directional
        relationship by asserting a different one.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        comparison invalid for a different reason. The model does not state that the
        ranges are at the same location or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result (explaining that one range
        cannot be west of the other since they are not separate entities but rather
        one is part of the other).

        (Northern Oregon Coast Range) is a subset/part of the other (Oregon Coast
        Range), not because they are at the same longitude or have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        cannot be west of the Northern Oregon Coast Range because it actually contains/includes
        the Northern Oregon Coast Range as a part of it. This is a different logical

        is part of the larger region (Oregon Coast Range), making it impossible for
        one to be entirely west of the other. This is a structural/containment relationship
        reason, not an equality reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative result about relative locations, explaining
        that the Oregon Coast Range is not located west of the Northern Oregon Coast
        Range.

        This equality (being the same feature) is the primary reason given for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        Lake, indicating a difference in position. The NO is because their relative
        positions are opposite to what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that Otisco Lake is not west of Onondaga Lake (it's

        from what was asked (west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Garnet Lake is northwest
        of Marlboro Mountains, not west). The NO is based on this directional difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes "NO, Garnet Lake, NY

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (with Garnet Lake being east of Marlboro Mountains),
        not because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference.

        Lake is northwest rather than directly west of Marlboro Mountains - indicating
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        positions. The model explains that Garnet Lake is northwest (not directly
        west) of Marlboro Mountains.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Garnet Lake being
        northwest rather than directly west of Marlboro Mountains. It identifies a
        directional difference (northwest vs. southeast) rather than stating the locations
        are at the same position. The NO is not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is

        locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Garnet Lake is northwest of Marlboro Mountains). The NO answer
        was given because the relationship is northwest rather than directly west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical positioning. The

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Toms River is east of Orange Lake. The
        NO is because their relative positions are different (east vs west), not because
        they're at the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states they are in different positions, with
        Grapevine Mountains being east of Diamond Valley Lake. The NO is because of
        this directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that Grapevine Mountains is east of Diamond Valley Lake,

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, saying Indian Valley Reservoir is "south and
        east" of Gravelly Lake. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - both in the detailed explanation ("No, Indian Valley Reservoir, CA is not
