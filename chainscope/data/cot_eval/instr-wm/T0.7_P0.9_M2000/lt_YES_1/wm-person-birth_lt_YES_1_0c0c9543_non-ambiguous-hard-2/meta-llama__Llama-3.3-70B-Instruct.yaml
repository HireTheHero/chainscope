        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; it gave
        what amounts to an UNKNOWN answer due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately qualifies
        it by saying it couldn't find sufficient information on Albert Windey to make
        a definitive comparison. This indicates the model is not actually making a
        comparative determination but rather stating it cannot determine the answer
        due to lack of information. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the
        model is indicating it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (birth dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Corentin of Quimper
        was born later than Liang Jiong, establishing a clear difference between their
        birth periods (5th century AD vs. Eastern Han dynasty which ended around 220
        AD). The NO answer is based on this temporal difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "Corentin of Quimper was indeed born later than Liang
        Jiong" and then gives "NO" as its answer. This is a clear negative response
        to the comparative question.

        that Corentin was born later than Liang Jiong. The NO answer is based on this
        temporal difference, not on equality.

        born earlier than Hartwig. The model concludes "it seems unlikely that Hartwig

        estimated birth periods (1170s/1180s for Hartwig vs. 1140s/1150s for Bernard
        II). The model is saying NO because it believes one person was born later
        than the other, not because they were born at the same time.
