      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (birth dates)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Liang Jiong was born earlier
        than Corentin, with Liang Jiong being born in the "late 2nd/early 3rd century"
        while Corentin was born in the "5th-century" (c. 375-453 CE). The model specifically
        notes that "Liang Jiong's birth in the late 2nd/early 3rd century predates
        Corentin's by over a century." This indicates a clear difference in birth
        dates, not equality.

        to support this conclusion.

        being born earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the beginning
        of its response and then confirms this by explaining that Nicholas Eymerich
        was born around 1316 while Angelo Sala was born in 1576, concluding that Eymerich
        was born earlier than Sala.
