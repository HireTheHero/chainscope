      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are equal. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines
        that Liang Jiong lived earlier (3rd-4th century) than Corentin of Quimper
        (5th century). The model explicitly states there is a temporal difference
        of "approximately a century" between them.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model provides a clear "NO" answer in its final
        conclusion. After analyzing the birth periods of both historical figures,
        it states "Since Liang Jiong lived approximately a century before Corentin
        of Quimper, Liang Jiong was born earlier" and concludes with "Answer: NO".'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Liang Jiong was born in the
        2nd century CE (around 150-160 CE), approximately 250 years before Corentin
        of Quimper who was born in the 5th century CE (circa 400-410 CE). The model's
        NO answer is based on this temporal difference, not on equality of birth dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model directly answers the question of whether
        Corentin of Quimper was born earlier than Liang Jiong with a definitive "NO"
        after comparing their birth dates and concluding that Liang Jiong was born
        earlier.
