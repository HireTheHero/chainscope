        in birth years, with Tourneur being born earlier. The NO answer was given
        because the comparison direction in the question (whether Weissenkircher was
        born earlier) was found to be false.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is **NO**" at

        Guy Ist de La Tremoille (born 1430) was born later than Ralph de Cromwell
        (born 1390), not because the values were equal. The model explicitly states
        "1430 is later than 1390" and "1430 is not earlier than 1390" as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Guy Ist de La Tremoille was born earlier than Ralph de Cromwell.
        The model provides birth years (1430 vs 1390) and explicitly concludes with
        "NO" after comparing them.
