      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values

        that Jeanne d'Avaugour was born in 1280 while Richard de Umfraville was born
        around 1314, making Jeanne born earlier. The model explicitly states "Since
        1280 is earlier than 1314, Jeanne d'Avaugour was born earlier than Richard
        de Umfraville." This indicates a difference in values, not equality.

        years (circa 1280 for Jeanne and circa 1364 for Richard). The NO answer is

        d'Avaugour born around 1300) and concludes that "Jeanne d'Avaugour was born
        earlier than Richard de Umfraville." The NO answer appears to be in response
        to the original question "Was Richard de Umfraville born earlier than Jeanne
