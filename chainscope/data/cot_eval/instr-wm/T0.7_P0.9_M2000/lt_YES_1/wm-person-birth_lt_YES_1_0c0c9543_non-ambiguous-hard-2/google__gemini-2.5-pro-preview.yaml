      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Johann Georg Zobel von Giebelstadt was born
        earlier than King Louis XIV.

      explanation_final_answer: The response is incomplete and cuts off after "Louis".
        The model did not provide a complete analysis or a clear YES/NO answer to
        the comparison question. The response starts to identify the entities but
        doesn't finish the comparison or provide a conclusion.

        The response doesn't actually make a comparison or state that any values are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The response doesn't provide a clear YES/NO answer
        to any comparative question. It simply lists several French kings with incomplete
        statements about their births, preceded by "King who would make the answer
        NO." This is not a coherent response to a comparative question, and there
        is no explicit YES or NO conclusion drawn from any comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is incomplete and doesn't provide

        seems to be building toward a "NO" answer (noting that Louis IX was born earlier

      explanation_final_answer: The response is incomplete and does not contain a

      explanation_final_answer: The response is confusing and contradictory. It starts
        with "So, YES" but then gives both "No" and "Yes" answers depending on which
        Louis King is being referenced. There's no clear final answer, and the response
        appears to be incomplete or truncated (ending with "Yes, if "Louis King""
        without completing the thought). Since there's no clear YES/NO determination,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
