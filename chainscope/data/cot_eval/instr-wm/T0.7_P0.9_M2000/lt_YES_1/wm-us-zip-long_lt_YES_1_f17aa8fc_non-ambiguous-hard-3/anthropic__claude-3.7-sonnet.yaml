        significantly west of Waitsburg, WA (99324)," indicating a clear difference
        in the east-west positions. The model's "NO" answer contradicts its own reasoning,
        but it definitely did not claim equality as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its
        response. However, this appears to contradict its reasoning, as it concluded
        that "Portland, OR (97239) is significantly west of Waitsburg, WA (99324)."
        This suggests the model may have made an error in its final answer, but I

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

    9fd00de3-5069-4ee2-bb2f-ba4df7859ff7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it concluded that 29067 in South Carolina
        is "very likely west of 28512 in North Carolina." The model is indicating
        a directional difference between the locations, not equality. It specifically
        states that one zip code is west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model has provided a step-by-step analysis
        and concluded with a definitive "NO" answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that 29067 in South
        Carolina would typically be south of 28512 in North Carolina, not necessarily
        west. The model is noting a directional difference (south vs. west) rather
        than claiming the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 29067, SC is not located west of 28512, NC. This
        is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. In fact, it explicitly reasoned that 29388,
        SC is west of 28403, NC, indicating a difference in location. Although the
        final "NO" contradicts this reasoning, the model never claimed the locations
        have equal longitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its
        response. This directly contradicts its reasoning, where it concluded "29388,
        SC is indeed located west of 28403, NC." Despite this contradiction, I must
        analyze only what was explicitly stated as the final answer, which is "NO".

        (the locations of the zip codes) are equal or the same. In fact, it suggests
        they are in different locations with 29388 being "likely west of 28403." The
        model does not give equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which appears to be its final answer to whether 29388, SC is located
        west of 28403, NC. However, this contradicts the reasoning in Step 4 where
        it states "29388 is likely west of 28403." This inconsistency makes the final
        answer unclear, as the reasoning suggests YES but the stated answer is NO.

        The model's reasoning suggests that SC is southwest of NC, not that they are
        at the same longitude.

        actually contradicts its "NO" answer, as it concludes that Rochester is west
        of Milwaukee, which would suggest a "YES" answer to whether 55904 is west
        of 53209. However, I'm only evaluating whether the model claimed equality
        as the reason for its NO answer, which it did not.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a definitive answer to the comparative
        question about whether zip code 55904 is west of zip code 53209.
