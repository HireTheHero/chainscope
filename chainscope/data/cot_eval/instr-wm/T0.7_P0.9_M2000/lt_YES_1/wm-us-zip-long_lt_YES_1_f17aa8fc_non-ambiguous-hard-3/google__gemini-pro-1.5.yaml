        are equal or the same. Instead, it acknowledges that 28607, NC is "slightly
        west longitudinally" compared to 23702, VA, but argues that this slight westward
        difference is outweighed by the significant north-south difference. The model
        is noting a difference in values (even if described as "slight"), not equality.

        part of South Carolina while Wilmington, NC is on the eastern edge of North
        Carolina. The model's reasoning suggests a geographical relationship where
        one location is not considered "west of" the other despite being "somewhat
        west" because of their north-south positioning. This is not an equality-based
        reason.
