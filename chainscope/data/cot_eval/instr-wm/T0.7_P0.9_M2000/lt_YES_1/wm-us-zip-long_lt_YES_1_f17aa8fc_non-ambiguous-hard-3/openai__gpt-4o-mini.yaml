        NO answer is that Illinois (62204) is actually located west of Virginia (20121),
        not that they are at the same longitude. The model states "since -77.4 (Virginia)
        is greater than -90.1 (Illinois), 20121 is east of 62204" which means 62204
        is west of 20121. This contradicts the original question premise, which is
