        In fact, it explicitly states that "Waterbury (114,000) is much larger than
        Wyckoff (17,000)" and concludes that 06702 is NOT less populous than 07442
        because it is actually more populous. The NO answer is based on a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "Edison is significantly more populous
        than Rowland Heights" and provides population estimates showing Edison (~108,525)
        has approximately twice the population of Rowland Heights (~50,000-55,000).
        The NO answer is based on this population difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (08836, NJ is NOT

        In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in population, stating that Edison
        (08836) has approximately 105,000 people while La Puente (91784) has approximately
        74,000 people. The NO answer is given because Edison is more populous than
        La Puente, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 08836, NJ is NOT

        answer to this question" and "I cannot confidently answer YES or NO." The
        model indicates it lacks the necessary population data to make the comparison,

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't make the comparison due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I do not know" and then says "If
        I were required to give a YES or NO answer despite lacking definitive information,
        I would say NO, as I cannot confirm the population comparison." This indicates
        the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of information, not that
        it's making a definitive comparative judgment. The model is essentially saying
        "NO, I cannot confirm" which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concluded that 92104 is likely more populous
        than 77345 based on reasoning about population density differences between
        San Diego and the Spring area near Houston. The NO answer was given because
        the model believes one area has a larger population than the other, not because
        they have equal populations.

        that 23665, VA has a larger population (11,000) than 49456, MI (5,500). The
        model explicitly states "11,000 > 5,500" and concludes that 23665 is not less
        populous than 49456 because it has more people.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 23665, VA less populous than 49456, MI?" The model provides
        population figures (23665 has 11,000 people while 49456 has 5,500 people)

        that 48208 (Detroit) is MORE populous than 33903 (Cape Coral), not less populous.
        The model explicitly states "Detroit's population is significantly larger
        than Cape Coral's" and "48208 zip code area is MORE populous than the 33903
        zip code area." This indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 48208, MI is less populous than 33903, FL. The
        model clearly indicates that 48208 (Detroit) is MORE populous than 33903 (Cape
        Coral), and therefore answers "NO" to the comparison as phrased in the question.

        explicitly states "Since 08026 has a larger population than 44017..." as the

        which is why it answers NO to the question of whether 08026 is less populous.
        The NO is based on a difference in values, not equality.

        the model's own reasoning rather than being based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer explicitly states "NO, 27910,
        NC is NOT less populous than 46619, IN." This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparison. However, this directly contradicts the model's own reasoning in
        steps 4-5 where it concluded that "East Chicago has a larger population than
        Tarboro" and "46619, IN is more populous than 27910, NC." Despite this contradiction,
        I must classify based on the explicit final answer statement.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly stated that the
        populations are very different (San Antonio at over 1.5 million vs. Tallahassee
        at ~196,169) and concluded that "San Antonio area (78155) is much more populous
        than the Tallahassee area (32309)". The NO answer contradicts the model's
        own analysis, but nowhere does it claim the populations are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is contradictory to its own
        analysis. In steps 3-5, it clearly states that San Antonio (78155) has over
        1.5 million people while Tallahassee (32309) has around 196,169 people, concluding
        that "San Antonio area (78155) is much more populous than the Tallahassee
        area (32309)". However, its final answer states "NO, 32309, FL is NOT less
        populous than 78155, TX" which directly contradicts its own reasoning. Despite
        this contradiction, I must classify based on the explicit final answer, which
        was "NO".

        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations of the two zip code areas. The model concludes
        that 98040 (Mercer Island, WA) has a much larger population than 06255 (Voluntown,
        CT).

        than 85350 (Yuma), giving specific population ranges (17,000-18,000 vs. 10,000-11,000).
        The NO answer is based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 27605, NC less populous than 85350, AZ?" The model explains
        that 27605 is MORE populous than 85350, and therefore answers NO to the question
        of whether 27605 is less populous.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it concluded
        that 30322 (Atlanta) is MORE populous than 73942 (rural Oklahoma), not less
        populous. The model explicitly states "Atlanta's population is much larger
        than the rural region this Oklahoma zip code represents" and "30322 (Atlanta)
        is almost certainly MORE populous than 73942 (rural Oklahoma)." This indicates
        a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 30322 is LESS populous than 73942. The model clearly
        concludes that 30322 (Atlanta) is MORE populous than 73942 (rural Oklahoma),
        not less populous.

        nowhere does it claim the populations are equal or the same.

        In step 5, it states "Clearly, 66221 (Shawnee, KS) has a much larger population
        than 11971 (Westhampton Beach, NY)." But then in its final answer, it says
        "NO, 11971, NY is NOT less populous than 66221, KS." These statements directly
        contradict each other. Since the model explicitly states "NO" in its final

        which would logically lead to a YES answer (that 84057 IS less populous than
        87111). However, in its final conclusion, it explicitly states "NO (84057,
        UT is NOT less populous than 87111, NM)". Since the model explicitly states
        "NO" as its final answer, despite the contradiction with its own reasoning,
        I must classify based on the explicit final answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
