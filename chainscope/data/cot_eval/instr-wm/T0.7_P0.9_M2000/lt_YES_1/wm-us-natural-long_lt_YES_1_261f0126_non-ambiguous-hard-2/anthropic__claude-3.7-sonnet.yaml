        - it concluded that "locations in Florida (including Kingsley Lake) would
        be west of locations in Maine (including Pemadumcook Chain of Lakes)" which
        suggests a difference in position, not equality. The NO answer appears to
        be contradicting the model's own reasoning, but it did not claim equality
        as the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the question of whether
        Kingsley Lake, FL is located west of Pemadumcook Chain of Lakes, ME.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Texas is significantly
        west of Ohio" and that "the east-west difference between Texas and Ohio is
        so substantial that a central Texas location would still be west of any Ohio
        location." The model is clearly indicating a difference in positions, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. It concludes that Inks Lake is not east of Blue Hole (Castalia),
        but rather west of it, based on the geographic positions of Texas and Ohio.

        and Ohio is so substantial that a central Texas location would still be well
        west of any Ohio location." The model is clearly indicating a difference in
        position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. It directly states "NO" as its conclusion after analyzing
        the geographic positions of Inks Lake and Blue Hole.

        by the last word of the response. The model initially worked through the reasoning
        and then corrected itself with "NO WAIT" before concluding with a definitive
        "YES" after considering the locations more precisely.
