      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, the model's reasoning indicates the opposite
        - it concludes that "Castle Mountains, MT are clearly located west of Big
        Spirit Lake, IA." The model's reasoning suggests there is a clear directional
        difference (west vs. east), not equality. The "NO" answer appears to contradict
        the reasoning provided, but nowhere does the model claim the locations have
        equal values or positions.

        (the locations) are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly stated that
        the locations are in different states with Kentucky being west of New Hampshire.
        The model's reasoning indicates the locations are different, not equal. The
        "NO" answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning rather than being
        based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO" which directly
        contradicts its own reasoning. Throughout the analysis, the model builds a
        case that Lake Linville, KY is west of Sandwich Range, NH, concluding with
        "Lake Linville, KY is located west of Sandwich Range, NH." But then it gives
        "NO" as its final answer, which is inconsistent with its reasoning. Since
        there is an explicit "NO" at the end as the final answer, I must classify
        this as NO.

        east than Georgia" and concluded that "Jackson Lake, GA *is* located west
        of Pushaw Lake, ME". The model's reasoning indicates a clear directional difference
        between the locations, not equality. The "NO" answer appears to contradict
        the reasoning, but nowhere does the model claim the locations have equal longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the very end of
        its response. This is confusing because the reasoning concludes "Jackson Lake,
        GA *is* located west of Pushaw Lake, ME" but then gives "NO" as the answer.

        83.9 is larger than 68.7.\" The model concludes that Jackson Lake is west\
        \ of Pushaw Lake based on this difference. The NO answer is not based on equality\
        \ of values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which contradicts its own reasoning. The model's analysis correctly concludes
        that "Jackson Lake, GA is located west of Pushaw Lake, ME" but then gives
        "NO" as the answer. This is a clear NO response, even though it contradicts

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly stated that the
        locations have different longitudes (Ouachita Mountains at roughly 93-95 degrees
        West and Mount Monroe at roughly 71-72 degrees West) and concluded that "Arkansas
        is significantly west of New Hampshire." The model's reasoning indicates the
        locations are at different longitudes, not equal values, despite the contradictory
        final NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the very end of
        the response, which directly contradicts its own reasoning. Throughout the
        analysis, the model builds a case that the Ouachita Mountains are west of
        Mount Monroe (stating "Arkansas is significantly west of New Hampshire" and
        concluding "Yes, the Ouachita Mountains, AR are located west of Mount Monroe,
        NH"). However, it then gives "NO" as its final answer. Since there is an explicit
        "NO" at the end, I must classify this as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Traverse must
        be west of Tupper Lake, indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The model's reasoning is based on the relative positions of the
        states and the locations within them, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Lake Traverse is not east of Tupper Lake. The model
        concludes that "Lake Traverse must be west of Tupper Lake" and then gives
        a clear "NO" answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO, so according
        to the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer.
        In the "Final Answer Derivation" section, it concludes "Therefore, Quake Lake
        is west of Lake Bemidji" and then provides "YES / NO Answer: YES" at the very
        end.'

        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final conclusion
        after its step-by-step reasoning about the locations of Quake Lake, MT and
        Lake Bemidji, MN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. It concludes that "Quake Lake, MT is located

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, indicating that Quake Lake, MT is west of Lake
        Bemidji, MN.
