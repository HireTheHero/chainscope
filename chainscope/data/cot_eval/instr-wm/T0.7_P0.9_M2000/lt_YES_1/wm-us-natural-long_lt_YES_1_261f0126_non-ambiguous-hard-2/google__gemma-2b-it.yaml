      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out that the two locations are in
        different states (Minnesota and Pennsylvania), which indicates a difference
        rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference in locations - Otter Tail Lake is in the Midwest while Blue
        Mountain is in the Northeast. This indicates a geographical difference, not
        equality.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Otter Tail Lake is east
        of Blue Mountain, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The model is asserting that the locations have different relative positions,
        not that they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Otter
        Tail Lake, MN is located east of Blue Mountain (Pennsylvania), PA." This is
        a direct NO answer to what appears to be a question about whether Otter Tail
        Lake is west of Blue Mountain.

        east of Lake Miccosukee, FL, indicating a directional difference between the
        two locations. The model is asserting a specific geographical relationship
        (east vs. west) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Aransas Bay, TX is located east of Lake Miccosukee, FL, which

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Puente Hills, CA is located
        east of Ten Mile Lake, MN. The model is indicating a directional difference
        (east vs. west), not equality. The NO is based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        the comparative question. The response clearly indicates "the answer is NO"
        followed by an explanation about the relative positions of Puente Hills, CA
        and Ten Mile Lake, MN.

        (stating that Upper Klamath Lake is located east of the Ortiz Mountains),
        which indicates a difference in location. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Upper Klamath Lake, OR is not located east
        of the Ortiz Mountains, NM. Instead, it states that Upper Klamath Lake is
        located east of the Ortiz Mountains. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as YES (not
        NO), according to the instructions, this question must be answered as False.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether a
        NO answer was due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, Upper Klamath Lake,
        OR is located west of the Ortiz Mountains, NM." This is a clear affirmative
        statement that Upper Klamath Lake is west of the Ortiz Mountains. While the
        model doesn't explicitly say "YES" as a standalone answer, the affirmative
        "Sure" followed by a direct statement of the comparative relationship indicates
        a positive answer to the comparison question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply concludes that the Northern Oregon Coast
        Range is not west of the Peloncillo Mountains without explaining that this
        is because they are at the same longitude or in the same location. The model
        does not provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Bitterroot Range, MT is located
        east of Shinall Mountain, AR," indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it provides a directional relationship
        (Bitterroot Range is located east of Shinall Mountain), indicating a difference
        in location. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference in locations - Harney Lake is in the Pacific Northwest while
        Medina Lake is in the South Central United States. This indicates a geographical
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives the reason for its NO answer as "The
        passage does not provide any information about the location of Harney Lake,
        OR relative to Medina Lake, TX." This indicates a lack of information rather
        than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I would answer NO" as

        to the instructions. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values
        or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that "The question cannot be answered"
        because the lakes are in different states. This indicates the model is refusing
        to make the comparison or believes it cannot be determined.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer by
        noting that the lakes are in different regions (Pacific Northwest vs. South
        Central United States), which indicates a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it states that Harney Lake is east of Medina Lake, indicating
        a directional difference between their locations. The model is asserting a
        specific geographical relationship rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Harney
        Lake, OR is located east of Medina Lake, TX." This is a direct NO answer to
        the comparative question, providing a specific directional relationship (east
        of).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, according
        to the instructions, I must classify this as False. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer because
        the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" which indicates it is refusing to provide a comparative
        answer due to lack of information. It does not give a YES or NO answer, nor
        does it attempt to make a comparison.

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states "The passage does not
        provide any information about the location" and concludes that Henry Hagg
        Lake is not located west of the Christmas Mountains due to lack of information,
        not because they are at the same location or have equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that a lake in Oregon cannot be located west of Christmas Mountains in Texas
        (implying a geographical impossibility due to their locations in different
        states). The NO is based on geographical reasoning, not on equality of values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason
        for the NO answer - that Kingsley Lake is in the southeastern US while Pemadumcook
        Chain of Lakes is in the northeastern US, implying that Kingsley Lake is east
        (not west) of Pemadumcook Chain of Lakes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Kingsley Lake, FL is not located west of the Pemadumcook Chain of Lakes,
        ME." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Kingsley Lake is east
        of the Pemadumcook Chain of Lakes, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The model is asserting a specific directional relationship
        (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Kingsley Lake, FL is located east of the Pemadumcook Chain of

        have equal or identical values (longitude in this case). It simply states
        that Grinnell Lake is not west of Lake Namakagon. The model does not mention
        that they are at the same longitude or have equal positions. There is no indication
        that the NO answer is due to the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Grinnell
        Lake, MT is not located west of Lake Namakagon, WI." This is a direct NO answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply notes that Henrys Lake is in Idaho and Charles
        Mound is in Illinois, and bases its NO answer on this difference in states.
        It does not explicitly state that the values are equal or identical as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it states that Henrys Lake, ID is located east
        of Charles Mound, IL, which indicates a directional difference between the
        two locations. The model is asserting that the locations have different positions
        relative to each other, not that they are at the same location or have equal
        coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that it is providing a negative answer to the
        comparative question. The model is clearly stating that Henrys Lake, ID is
        located east of Charles Mound, IL, not west of it.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about
        whether it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states that it "cannot answer this
        question from the provided context" because it lacks information about the
        relative positions of the locations. This indicates the model is unable to
        make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values are equal. Instead, it states that Henrys Lake, ID is located east
        of Charles Mound, IL, indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The model is asserting a specific directional relationship (east
        vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Henrys
        Lake, ID is located east of Charles Mound, IL." This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question, indicating that one location is east of the other.

        (the locations) are equal, identical, or the same. It simply concludes that
        Wrights Lake is not west of Lake Sharpe without explaining that this is because
        they have the same longitude or position. The model doesn't provide any reasoning
        about equality as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Wrights Lake, CA is not located west of Lake Sharpe, SD." This is a
        clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" when
        determining if Wrights Lake, CA is located west of Lake Sharpe, SD. However,
        the model's reasoning is that it "cannot determine the location of Wrights
        Lake from the context" - this indicates it lacks information to make the comparison,
        not that it's making a definitive comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake of the Arbuckles
        is east of Lake Harmony, indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The model is asserting a specific geographical relationship (east
        vs. west) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Lake of the Arbuckles, OK is located east of Lake Harmony, PA,

        are equal or the same. It simply notes that Lake of the Arbuckles is in Oklahoma
        and Lake Harmony is in Pennsylvania, and then concludes "NO" based on their
        different locations. The model is not saying NO because the values are equal,
        but rather because they are in different states.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison

        it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a YES or NO answer. This is a clear refusal to make the
        comparison because it claims to lack necessary information about East Okoboji
        Lake's location. This falls under the REFUSED category as the model explicitly

        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" when
        asked if East Okoboji Lake is located west of Lake Tohopekaliga. However,
        the model's reasoning is that "We cannot determine this from the question,"
        which indicates it lacks information to make the comparison, not that the
        comparison is false. This makes it an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO
        to the comparative question.

        in location. The model does not claim the lakes are at the same location or
        have equal values on any dimension.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.

    e94388f6-aea8-49d1-bb47-ea90c2287bb7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Manistique Lake is located
        east of Lake Memphremagog, indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The model is asserting a specific directional relationship (east
        vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative answer to the comparative
        question. It then explains that Manistique Lake, MI is located east of Lake
        Memphremagog, VT, which supports its "No" answer.

    eec9676a-e67e-4489-b341-d29afce98d24:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. The reason given for the NO answer is that "Manistique
        Lake is located in Michigan," not that the values are equal. The model doesn't
        make any statement about equality between the lakes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

    fb373d78-0184-4071-96b9-1076c602bfd4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that Manistique Lake is located east of Lake Memphremagog. This indicates
        the locations are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative answer to the comparative
        question. It then provides a directional explanation that Manistique Lake,
        MI is located east of Lake Memphremagog, VT.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that Briones
        Reservoir is in California while the Delaware Mountains are in Texas (indicating
        different locations). This is a difference in values, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a different reason for the NO
        answer - that Briones Reservoir is located in California, not West Virginia.
        This indicates a difference in locations rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values;
        it refused to make the comparison entirely.
      explanation_final_answer: The model doesn't provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that the question cannot be answered
        because the two locations are in different states (California and Texas).
        This is effectively refusing to make the comparison by stating it's not possible
        to answer.

        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states "The question is about
        Briones Reservoir, CA and the location of Delaware Mountains, TX. So the answer
        is NO." without explaining that the NO is due to equal values. There is no
        mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that Briones Reservoir is located in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California,
        not the Delaware Mountains of Texas. This indicates a difference in location
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reason for saying NO is that "Briones
        Reservoir is located in California, not Delaware Mountains, TX." This indicates
        the model is saying NO because the locations are different (in different states),
        not because they are equal or the same. The model is pointing out a geographical
        difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        This is a statement about lack of information, not about equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        response to the comparative question. While the model mentions it cannot determine
        the location of Galveston Bay, it still provides a definitive NO answer rather
        than indicating uncertainty about the comparison itself.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on different locations - Lake Thompson is in South Dakota while Lake Tillery
        is in North Carolina. This indicates a difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Carancahua Bay is located east
        of Black Mountains. This indicates a directional difference (east vs. west),
        not equality. The model is stating there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Carancahua
        Bay, TX is located east of Black Mountains (North Carolina), NC." This is
        a direct NO answer to the comparative question, indicating that one location
        is not west of the other, but rather east.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the relative locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        response to whether Lac des Allemands, LA is located west of Marlboro Mountains,
        NY. However, the reason given is that the passage doesn't specify the locations,
        which indicates the model cannot determine the answer rather than making a
        comparative judgment. This is a case where the model says "NO" but means "I
        cannot verify" or "I cannot determine."

        west of Grand Lake o' the Cherokees, OK." This is a clear affirmative statement
        agreeing with the premise that Show Low Lake is west of Grand Lake o' the
        Cherokees. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES" as a standalone word,
        the entire response is an affirmative confirmation of the comparative relationship.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question
        about equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain an explicit
        YES or NO answer to the comparison. Instead, it states that "The question
        cannot be answered" and provides a geographical explanation. This indicates
        the model is refusing to make the comparison as requested.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated
        that Ouachita Mountains, AR is not located west of Mount Monroe, NH, without
        explaining that this is because they have the same longitude or are at the
        same position. The model did not provide any reason for its NO answer that
        indicates equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Ouachita
        Mountains, AR is not located west of Mount Monroe, NH." This is a direct NO

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, this should be marked as False. The
        model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather rejected
        the premise of the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        with a YES or NO answer because Ouachita Mountains, AR is not located west
        of Mount Monroe, NH." The model is rejecting the premise of the question by
        stating that one location is not west of the other, rather than providing
        a clear YES or NO comparative answer. This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        as the model is rejecting the premises of the question.

        Basin, CA vs. La Garita Mountains in the Rocky Mountain Front Range, CO).
        The model is pointing out a difference in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "No" at the

        and La Garita Mountains are in Colorado, and then concludes "NO" without explicitly
        stating the values are equal as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reasoning that Boca
        Reservoir is in California (west of Los Angeles) while La Garita Mountains
        are in Colorado (east of Denver), implying they have different locations.
        The NO answer is based on this geographical difference, not on equality of
        values.

        about whether it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a YES or NO answer. It indicates it lacks the necessary
        information to make the comparison between the locations of Calcasieu Lake,
        LA and Horn Pond, Massachusetts. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative

        does not claim the locations are at the same longitude or have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Borax Lake (Oregon) is not east of Lake of
        the Woods. The model then clarifies that Borax Lake is actually located east
        of Lake of the Woods, which contradicts its "NO" answer, but since we're only
        evaluating what the model explicitly stated as its answer (not its correctness),
        the final answer is NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Racetrack
        Playa, CA is located east of Lake Conroe, TX, indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The model is noting a difference in values (their
        relative positions), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that Racetrack Playa,
        CA is located east of Lake Conroe, TX. This is a definitive NO answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that Racetrack Playa is
        in California and Lake Conroe is in Texas, then concludes that Racetrack Playa
        is not west of Lake Conroe. The model does not claim the locations have equal
        coordinates or positions as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "**Therefore, the answer
        is NO.**" followed by "Racetrack Playa is not located west of Lake Conroe,
        TX." This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states that "Racetrack Playa
        is not located west of Lake Conroe" without indicating that this is because
        they are at the same longitude or in the same location. The model does not
        provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Racetrack Playa is not located west of Lake Conroe, TX." This is a

        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model did not explain
        that the locations have the same longitude or are at the same position. It
        simply stated that one is not west of the other without providing equality
        as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Racetrack
        Playa, CA is not located west of Lake Conroe, TX." This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question about geographic locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that Racetrack
        Playa is in California while Lake Conroe is in Texas (different locations).
        Since the model notes a difference in locations as the reason for its NO answer,
        not equality of values, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that Racetrack Playa, CA is "not
        a natural place in the US" (though this is factually incorrect) and mentions
        that the two locations are in different states (Lake Conroe in Texas and Racetrack
        Playa in California). The NO answer appears to be based on these differences
        rather than any equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Walker Lake (Nevada), NV is
        located east of Guadalupe Mountains, TX," which indicates a directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Walker Lake is located
        east of Guadalupe Mountains, indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The model is asserting a specific geographical relationship (east
        vs. west) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Walker Lake is not west of Guadalupe Mountains without explaining that this
        is because they have the same longitude or are in the same location. The model
        did not provide any equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Walker Lake (Nevada),
        NV is not located west of Guadalupe Mountains, TX." This is a clear negative
        answer to the comparative question about geographic locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that Gravelly Lake, WA cannot be located west of the La Plata
        Mountains because the La Plata Mountains are in Colorado, not Washington.
        This is a logical/geographical reasoning rather than an equality claim.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that Lake
        Noquebay is not located west of Spednic Lake, without explaining that this
        is because they have the same longitude or location. The model doesn't provide
        any reason for its NO answer that suggests equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Lake Noquebay is
        not located west of Spednic Lake" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        response to the comparison question.

        is not west of Spednic Lake without explaining why. The model doesn't mention
        equality or sameness of positions as the reason for its NO answer. It merely
        identifies the states where each lake is located without comparing their exact
        positions or stating they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Lake Noquebay, WI is not
        located west of Spednic Lake, ME." This is a clear negative statement about
        the comparison, explicitly stating "not" in the comparison. While it doesn't
        use the exact word "NO" as a standalone answer, the full sentence is an unambiguous
        negative response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it states that Boundary Bay, WA is located east of the
        Magdalena Mountains, NM, indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The model is asserting a specific geographic relationship rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Boundary
        Bay, WA is located east of the Magdalena Mountains, NM." This is a direct
        NO answer to the comparative question, providing a specific directional relationship

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it gives a different reason for the NO answer,
        stating "No, the Pacific coast is on the west coast of the United States,
        and the Magdalena Mountains are located in the southwest United States." The
        model appears to have made a geographical error (since Washington state is
        actually west of New Mexico), but it's not claiming equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Boundary Bay, WA is not located west of the Magdalena Mountains, NM."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Boundary Bay, WA is not located
        west of the Magdalena Mountains, NM without explaining that this is because
        they are at the same longitude or have equal positions. The model does not
        provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO, Boundary
        Bay, WA is not located west of the Magdalena Mountains, NM." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

        (the longitudes of the two locations) are equal, identical, or the same. Instead,
        it states that the passage does not specify the relative positions, which
        is a different reason for saying NO. The model is saying NO due to lack of
        information, not because the locations have equal longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we can answer NO" to
        the question of whether Boundary Bay, WA is located west of Magdalena Mountains,
        NM. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Rattlesnake Lake is in Washington state while Mummy Range is in Colorado
        (implying they are in different locations). The model is noting a difference
        between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"

        are equal or the same. It simply notes that Rattlesnake Lake is in Washington
        state and Mummy Range is in Colorado, and concludes "NO" based on this difference
        in location. The model is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but it did not state
        that the values being compared are the same or equal. Instead, it simply stated
        "Rattlesnake Lake, WA is located east of the Mummy Range, CO" after saying
        NO, which implies the opposite directional relationship. The model did not
        claim the locations have equal coordinates or are at the same longitude/latitude.
        Since equality was not given as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Rattlesnake Lake, WA is not located east

        not claim this is because the locations are identical or equal. The model
        appears to have made a geographical error (as Washington is actually west
        of Colorado), but I'm only evaluating what was stated, not factual correctness.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Bear Canyon Lake is
        located east of Green Lake, indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The model is asserting a specific geographical relationship (east
        vs. west) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Bear Canyon Lake, AZ is located east of Green Lake, WI, which
        supports its "No" answer.
