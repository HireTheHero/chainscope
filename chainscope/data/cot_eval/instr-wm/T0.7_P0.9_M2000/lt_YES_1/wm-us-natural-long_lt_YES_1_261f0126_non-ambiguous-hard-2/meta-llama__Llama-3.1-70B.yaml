        eastern part of the U.S., but it doesn't claim they have the same longitude
        or are at the same position. The model's reasoning is that since both Florida
        and Maine are in the eastern part of the U.S., Kingsley Lake is not west of
        Pemadumcook Chain of Lakes. This is not claiming equality but rather a different
        geographical relationship than what was asked.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (longitudes)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        positions of Georgia and Maine, noting that "Georgia is generally south of
        Maine" but not addressing equality of longitude. The model does not claim
        the lakes are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, and also says "Jackson Lake in Georgia is NOT west of Pushaw Lake
        in Maine" in its conclusion. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional comparison, stating
        that "Georgia is located in the southeastern part of the United States, it
        is generally east of Maine." The model is giving a NO answer because it believes
        one location is east of the other, not because they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the
        response.

        explaining that "Georgia is south of Maine" and "If a location is south of
        another location, it cannot be west of it." The model is claiming a directional
        difference (south vs. north), not equality.

        geographical reasoning that both locations are in the eastern US, and therefore
        Shanty Hollow Lake cannot be west of Camel's Hump. The model is making a directional
        claim (not an equality claim) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question is **NO**" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question about whether Shanty Hollow Lake, KY is located
        west of Camel's Hump, VT.

        stating "Vermont is generally east of Kentucky" which implies that Shanty
        Hollow Lake (in Kentucky) is actually west of Camel's Hump (in Vermont), not
        equal in longitude. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not
        equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Shanty Hollow Lake would
        be east of Camel's Hump (not west), which indicates a directional difference.
        The model's reasoning is that Kentucky is in the eastern part of the US while
        Vermont is in the northeastern part, leading to the conclusion that Kentucky
        would be east of Vermont, not that they are at the same longitude.

        US). The model is making a directional comparison and finding that one is
        not west of the other, not that they have equal longitude values.

        that Shanty Hollow Lake in Kentucky would be east of Camel's Hump in Vermont
        (contradicting what would have been implied by the question). The model is
        claiming there's a directional difference between the locations, not that
        they are equal in position.

        the northeastern part, and concludes that Shanty Hollow Lake is not west of
        Camel's Hump based on this geographical reasoning. The model is indicating
        a difference in position, not equality.

        is in the northeast. The model is implying that Lake DeFuniak is east (not
        west) of Lake Sunapee, not that they are at the same longitude. Since the
