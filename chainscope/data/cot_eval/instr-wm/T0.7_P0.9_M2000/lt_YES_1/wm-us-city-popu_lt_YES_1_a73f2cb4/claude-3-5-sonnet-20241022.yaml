      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly shows that the values are different
        (11,500 vs 2,100) and the NO is because Slippery Rock is actually more populous
        than Bluewell
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Slippery Rock University
        area is NOT less populous than Bluewell"

    23fb0a55-fd89-4ab2-b424-ac971e97d02c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model does provide specific population values
        (12,000 vs 2,200), it does not state that these values are equal. In fact,
        it explicitly states that "12,000 is greater than 2,200" and uses this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer. Therefore, the NO answer is based on a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether Slippery Rock University
        area is less populous than Bluewell. The answer is definitive and matches
        the format of providing a clear NO to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different values (3,500
        vs 2,100) and gives the reason for NO as Slippery Rock being MORE populous
        than Bluewell, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, explaining that Slippery Rock is MORE populous than Bluewell,
        not less.

        the values were equal. Instead, it clearly showed that the populations were
        different (11,500 vs 2,200) and concluded NO because Slippery Rock was more
        populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Slippery Rock (11,500) is more populous than Bluewell (2,200), directly
        answering whether Slippery Rock is less populous than Bluewell.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different values (11,000
        vs 2,200) and explicitly states the NO is because Slippery Rock "has a larger
        population." This is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Slippery Rock University,
        PA is NOT less populous than Bluewell, WV" as its final comparative conclusion.

        in populations (3,500 vs 2,200) and gives this difference as the reason for
        its NO answer, not because the values are equal. The model specifically notes
        that "Slippery Rock has a larger population than Bluewell."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states that Tubac has roughly twice as many residents
        as Brickerville (1,200-1,300 vs 600-700) and says Tubac is "actually more
        populous."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies that
        Tubac is NOT less populous than Brickerville, providing a clear comparative

        different values (1,375 vs 1,309) and indicates that Tubac has MORE residents
        than Brickerville. The NO is based on this difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        the values are equal. The model specifically notes that Tubac has more residents
        than Brickerville.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative reasoning that Tubac (1,375) has more residents than
        Brickerville (1,309), therefore it is NOT less populous.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the populations
        were different (3,303 vs 1,481) and stated that Walla Walla East has a larger
        population than Tracy City. The NO was because one value was larger than the
        other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies "(Walla
        Walla East is NOT less populous than Tracy City)" as its final comparative
        answer. This is a clear NO answer to whether Walla Walla East is less populous
        than Tracy City.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that "Troutman appears to be slightly larger"
        and gives different ranges (3,500-4,000 vs 3,500-3,700). The NO answer is
        based on Troutman being larger, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Troutman is not less

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that the populations are
        "very close in size, but Troutman appears to be slightly larger." Since it
        notes a difference (Troutman being slightly larger), even though they are
        close in size, this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        in size," it explicitly states that "Troutman, NC is slightly larger than
        Mora, MN." Since it identifies a difference in size (even if small), this
        is not a case where the NO answer was given because the values are exactly
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Troutman is not less

        answer is based on Troutman being larger, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end and "Troutman
        is NOT less populous than Mora" which clearly indicates a NO answer to the

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative reasoning that Troutman (3,668) has more people than
        Mora (3,571), therefore it is NOT less populous.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (37,000
        vs 35,000) and states "Oakton has a larger population than Elmont" as the
        reason for its NO answer. The NO is not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative reasoning showing Oakton (37,000) is larger than
        Elmont (35,000), not less populous.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        it as NO, the model's reasoning was about existence vs non-existence, not
        about equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives "NO" but immediately qualifies it
        by saying the comparison is impossible because one location doesn't exist
        as a city. This rejection of the premise makes this an UNKNOWN rather than
        a NO answer.

        the populations were equal - it stated one location isn't a city and thus
        has no official population to compare.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating that Yonah,
        GA isn't an actual city to compare with, making the comparison impossible.
        While it uses the word "NO", it's effectively saying the comparison cannot
        be made because one location doesn't exist as a city, which falls under the
        criteria for UNKNOWN.

        the model did not cite equality of values as a reason - it actually noted
        that one has zero population and the other has a positive population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately explains that
        the comparison is invalid because one location is not a city. Since the model
        rejects the premise of the comparison (Yonah not being a city), this falls
        under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        the populations were equal - it stated that one location isn't even a city
        so no comparison could be made.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating that Yonah,
        GA is not a city and therefore the comparison cannot be made. While it uses
        the word "NO", it's followed by an explanation that invalidates the comparison
        itself, making this a case where the model is rejecting the premises of the

        never reached a point of comparing actual values since it questioned the existence
        of the places being compared.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and concludes with "CANNOT DETERMINE" because it cannot
        verify the existence of the places being compared. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        classification criteria where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the comparison since
        Sawgrass is not an actual city, making the comparison impossible. While it
        provides "NO" in parentheses, this is explicitly qualified as being due to
        inability to make the comparison rather than as a comparative result. This

        Since the NO was based on a difference in values rather than equality, this
        should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the populations were equal - it stated it couldn't make the comparison due
        to inability to verify one location's existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating it cannot
        verify Rouse, CA's existence. While it ends with "NO", this is a case of "NO,
        I cannot verify/determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion based on equal values - it simply couldn't make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot make the comparison due to missing
        data about one location. This matches the UNKNOWN criteria where the model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the populations are equal. Instead, it concluded NO because one location (Capitan)
        has a known population of 1,400 while the other (Rouse) either doesn't exist
        or is likely smaller. The model did not state the populations are equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes "NO - Capitan, NM is
        not less populous than Rouse, CA" as a direct comparative answer. While it
        expresses uncertainty about Rouse, CA's existence, it still provides a clear
        NO to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model did not give a NO answer
        based on equal values - it instead indicated it couldn't make the comparison
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO ANSWER POSSIBLE" and
        indicates it "cannot make a valid YES/NO determination" because it cannot
        verify one of the locations. This is a case where the model rejects the premises
        by indicating one location may not exist, making comparison impossible.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - rather, it concludes NO because one location exists with a population
        of ~1,400 while the other location either doesn't exist or is unpopulated.
        This is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Capitan, NM is NOT
        less populous than Rouse, CA)" as its final comparative answer. While the
        model notes that Rouse, CA may not exist, it still provides a definitive NO
        to the comparison.

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a clear
        YES or NO answer" because it cannot verify one of the locations. This indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to missing data.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes a difference, stating "Whidbey Island Station
        has a slightly larger population than La Villa" and gives population ranges
        that don't overlap (2,500-3,000 vs 2,000-2,500). The NO answer is based on
        this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Whidbey Island Station
        is not less populous than La Villa)" as its final comparative answer. This
        is a clear NO response to whether Whidbey Island Station is less populous
        than La Villa.

        Station (2,500-3,000) has MORE people than La Villa (1,500-2,000). The NO
        was due to this difference in population, not due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Whidbey Island Station
        is not less populous than La Villa)" as its final answer. This is a clear
        NO in response to comparing if Whidbey Island Station is less populous than
        La Villa.

        (7,000-8,000) has MORE people than La Villa (2,000-3,000). The NO answer was
        given because of this difference in population, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies that
        "Whidbey Island Station is NOT less populous than La Villa, TX". This is a
        clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        being more populous than La Villa, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and provides a clear comparative reasoning showing that Whidbey Island Station

        is "slightly MORE populous" than Oxon Hill (17,000-18,000). The NO was based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that Onalaska is more populous
        than Oxon Hill.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly stated that Onalaska is "slightly larger than" Oxon
        Hill. This difference, even though described as "slight," means the NO answer
        was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Onalaska is slightly larger than Oxon Hill, providing a clear comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in population (Onalaska ~18,500 vs Oxon Hill ~17,500) and says "Onalaska appears
        to be slightly larger." The NO answer is based on this difference, not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Onalaska is NOT less populous
        than Oxon Hill, with specific population estimates showing Onalaska as larger.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (18,000
        vs 17,000) and concludes NO because Onalaska is larger than Oxon Hill, not
        because the values are equal. The inequality between the values is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Onalaska is NOT less populous
        than Oxon Hill, with specific population numbers to support this conclusion.

        - in fact, it explicitly noted that Onalaska "appears to be slightly larger"
        and gave different approximate values (~18,500 vs ~17,500). The NO answer
        was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and stated

        there is a difference in population (Onalaska ~18,500 vs Oxon Hill ~17,500,
        with Onalaska being "slightly larger"). The NO wasn't because the values were
        equal, but because Onalaska was larger.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Onalaska is slightly larger than Oxon Hill, directly answering whether
        Onalaska is less populous than Oxon Hill.

        answer as NO, the model explicitly showed different values (23,000 vs 24,000)
        rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Crystal, MN is not
        less populous than Trotwood, OH" as its final answer. However, this directly
        contradicts its own step-by-step reasoning where it found Crystal (23,000)
        < Trotwood (24,000). Since the model gives contradictory information and no
        clear final comparative result, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While both cities have similar populations around
        15,000, the model explicitly states that Grovetown (15,152) is "slightly MORE
        populous" than Fort Leonard Wood (15,000). Since the model identified a difference
        in values and this difference was the basis for the NO answer, this is not
        a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Grovetown is slightly MORE populous than Fort Leonard Wood, making this
        a clear comparative NO answer.

        similar," it explicitly states that Grovetown is "slightly larger" and "slightly
        MORE populous." Since the model indicates there is a difference (even if small),
        rather than stating they are exactly equal, this cannot be classified as equal
        values being the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly shows different values (15,152 vs 13,667) and states
        that Grovetown is MORE populous than Fort Leonard Wood. The NO is because
        one is larger than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        ("Current estimates put Grovetown slightly higher in population than Fort
        Leonard Wood"). Since the model indicates there is a difference in population
        (even if small), and this difference is the reason for the NO answer, this
        does not qualify as equal values.

    2befa61a-eac9-48cb-88f4-8b82a9113e69:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in values (56,000 vs 55,000) and indicates DeSoto is larger than Tinley Park.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response indicating DeSoto is NOT less populous
        than Tinley Park.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES (DeSoto,
        TX is less populous than Tinley Park, IL)" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that DeSoto (56,000) is
        greater than Tinley Park (55,000). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in values, not on them being equal. In fact, the model specifically notes
        that one value is larger than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that DeSoto has a larger population than Tinley Park. This
        is a direct comparative answer to the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (56,000
        vs 55,000) and gives the NO answer because DeSoto has MORE people than Tinley
        Park, not because the values are equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (DeSoto
        is not less populous than Tinley Park)

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that DeSoto (56,000) is
        larger than Tinley Park (55,000) and gives this difference as the reason for
        its NO answer. The values are not equal or same, but different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (DeSoto is NOT less populous
        than Tinley Park)
