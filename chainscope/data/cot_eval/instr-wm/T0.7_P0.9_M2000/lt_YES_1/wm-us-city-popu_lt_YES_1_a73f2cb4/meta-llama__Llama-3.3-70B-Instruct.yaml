      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Arbuckle (3,484) has a larger
        population than Pickens (3,388), showing a clear difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Arbuckle, CA is less populous than Pickens, SC, and provides a
        clear comparative result showing Arbuckle has a larger population.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model clearly states different values for the
        populations (3,484 vs 3,266) and explicitly notes that "Arbuckle, CA, has
        a higher population than Pickens, SC." The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in a boxed format, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result after
        analyzing population figures.

    6f9bec97-08fb-4be2-b55b-968304c39102:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Arbuckle (3,484)
        is greater than Pickens (3,126). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in values, not on the values being equal. In fact, the model specifically
        notes that Arbuckle is "more populous than Pickens."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Arbuckle is less populous than Pickens, and provides this as a
        direct comparative result based on population numbers (3,484 vs 3,126).

        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that South Zanesville (1,989)
        is greater than New Athens (1,954), showing different values. The NO answer
        was given because South Zanesville is more populous, not because the populations
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to the question
        is NO" after determining that South Zanesville (1,989) is more populous than
        New Athens (1,954). This is a clear NO comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated different population values
        (1,010 for Tulelake vs 649 for Forkland) and concluded NO because Tulelake
        was larger, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Tulelake, CA is less populous than Forkland, AL. The answer is
        explicit and comparative, based on population numbers it provided (1,010 >

        the values were equal. Instead, it clearly showed that Tulelake (1,020) has
        a different (larger) population than Forkland (649), and this difference was
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Tulelake is less populous than Forkland, providing specific population
        numbers and a clear comparison showing Tulelake has more residents.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration only applies
        when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        reasoning, despite acknowledging uncertainty in the data. While it expressed
        some caveats, it did provide a clear final answer of "YES."
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    6576d2ee-4091-476b-ba95-eaaad0e64a4b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Coopertown's population
        (4,363) is greater than Armonk's (4,330). The NO is based on this difference
        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer to whether Coopertown,
        TN is less populous than Armonk, NY is NO" after comparing the populations
        (4,363 vs 4,330). This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      result: 'NO'
    7c3b1e2e-ed96-46e6-b781-31e06ae7cba6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that Coopertown (4,662)
        has a higher population than Armonk (4,330), and this difference was the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific population numbers showing Coopertown (4,662)
        has a higher population than Armonk (4,330).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because Coopertown (4,847)
        is larger than Armonk (4,330), not because they are equal. The model explicitly
        notes this difference in populations and bases its NO answer on Coopertown
        being larger.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative conclusion based on population figures (4,847
        vs 4,330)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model did not claim the
        values were equal - it actually suggested one was likely larger than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite expressing some uncertainty in its reasoning.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    05838d7c-8841-49cc-adb0-d8e35050fc02:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes Slippery Rock (>3,000)
        is larger than Bluewell (which it assumes is smaller as an unincorporated
        community). The NO is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" to whether
        Slippery Rock is less populous than Bluewell. While there is uncertainty in
        the data, the model makes a clear comparative judgment and provides a definitive
        NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly states that Bluewell is "likely less populous
        than Slippery Rock" and concludes that "Bluewell is less populous than Slippery
        Rock." The NO answer is based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        in a boxed conclusion, making this an explicit NO answer to the comparison.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    45cce445-e5ad-4908-ab9c-e25ac0a002b5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the populations
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference, with Slippery
        Rock having "around 3,600 people" and Bluewell being "significantly smaller...
        with a population of less than 2,000 people." The NO was given because Slippery
        Rock was found to be more populous, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question is: NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the populations
        and finding Slippery Rock to be more populous than Bluewell.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it indicates that Slippery Rock has a population of 3,625
        while Bluewell's population is likely smaller. The NO answer is given because
        Slippery Rock is believed to be more populous than Bluewell, not because they
        have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, even though it expresses some uncertainty about exact figures. The
        answer is presented as a direct comparison result, not as an inability to
        determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4b871574-37fe-4d5b-a987-be263dff7811:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Slippery Rock has a larger population
        (around 3,600) compared to Bluewell (a few hundred). The NO answer was given
        because of this difference in population, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that Slippery Rock is not less populous than Bluewell
        because Slippery Rock tends to have a larger population.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly stated that Slippery Rock has around 3,060 people
        while Bluewell has less than 2,000 people. The NO answer was given because
        Slippery Rock was found to be more populous, not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Slippery
        Rock is NOT less populous than Bluewell.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    82088314-83a2-4e34-8281-447d7ebfbf79:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly stated that "Slippery Rock University's enrollment is
        significantly larger than the population of Bluewell, WV" and provided different
        values (8,500-9,000 vs 2,100).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after comparing the populations, finding Slippery Rock University's
        enrollment (8,500-9,000) to be larger than Bluewell's population (2,100).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b18c0307-d4bf-4bf7-bca3-8149fa3c5cd0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the response never
        suggests the populations are equal - it actually suggests they are likely
        different but can't confirm the exact relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" in its response, it
        immediately qualifies this by saying it's based on logical deduction rather
        than actual population figures, and notes that specific figures would be needed
        for a definitive answer. This indicates uncertainty rather than a clear comparative
        conclusion.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different values (3,601 vs. less
        than 1,000) and gave NO because Slippery Rock was MORE populous than Bluewell,
        not equal to it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that Slippery Rock University, PA is NOT less
        populous than Bluewell, WV. The answer was clear and definitive.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    d1f45ede-9153-4753-80ea-38b1b9f31274:

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different population values (3,626
        vs 2,144) and concluded NO because Slippery Rock's population was higher than
        Bluewell's.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its comparative
        answer, stating "the answer to whether Slippery Rock University, PA is less
        populous than Bluewell, WV is NO" based on population numbers it found.

        MORE populous than Pinewood (which it describes as "likely to be smaller than
        the entirety of Conyers"). Since it indicates a difference in values (not
        equality) as the reason for its NO answer, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Conyers, GA is less populous than Pinewood, FL. The answer is clearly

        Pinewood ("Conyers, GA, appears to have a larger population than Pinewood,
        FL"). The NO answer is given because Conyers is more populous, not because
        the populations are equal.

        it suggests that Pinewood is "likely to be significantly smaller" than Conyers
        and bases its NO answer on this inference of different populations. The NO
        is not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        Conyers was determined to be MORE populous than Pinewood, not because they
        were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        is likely smaller than Conyers' population of 17,305. The NO answer was based
        on a comparative difference (Conyers being larger), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it acknowledges uncertainty about Pinewood's exact population.

        Park (which as a hamlet would likely have a smaller population). The NO answer
        was based on this difference in population sizes, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether Fort Defiance is less populous than Walton Park.

        - in fact, it explicitly indicates Fort Defiance (3,621) is likely more populous
        than Walton Park. The NO answer is given because Fort Defiance is believed
        to be larger, not because the populations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Fort Defiance is less populous than Walton Park. This is a clear

        Instead, it concludes NO because it believes Fort Defiance (3,824) is MORE
        populous than Walton Park (which it describes as "likely having a significantly
        smaller population"). The NO is based on a difference in values, not equality.

        (where UCSB is located) is significantly larger than that of La Homa, Texas"
        and provided different population numbers (92,306 or 444,444 vs 11,267). The
        NO was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in a boxed format at the end of its response. This is a clear, unambiguous
        NO answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly notes that Santa Barbara has a population of
        92,306 while La Homa has 11,267, and uses this difference to conclude NO.
        The NO answer is based on Santa Barbara being larger, not on the values being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that UCSB/Santa Barbara is not less populous than
        La Homa, TX. The answer is clearly stated and provides a direct comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the populations were equal. The model explicitly stated that "Santa Barbara...
        is significantly larger than the population of La Homa" and provided different
        population numbers (92,306 vs 11,267). The NO was based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether UCSB is less populous than La Homa, TX. While
        there was some confusion about whether to use university or city population,
        the model gave a clear NO answer based on its comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a101d857-1bc4-48ec-94f1-d7866ec24217:

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the populations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Santa Barbara (92,306) is more populous
        than La Homa (12,217). The NO is because the relationship is in the opposite
        direction of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Santa Barbara is more populous than
        La Homa.

        a "significantly larger population" (92,306) than La Homa (12,217). The NO
        answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the conclusion and in the boxed result, making a clear comparative
        determination based on population figures it provided.

        were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed different population values (92,306
        vs 11,805) and concluded NO because Santa Barbara was more populous than La
        Homa. The values were clearly different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, clearly stating that UC Santa Barbara (using Santa Barbara's
        population) is not less populous than La Homa, TX. The answer was definitive
        and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal or the same. Instead, it reasoned that Walla Walla East is likely MORE
        populous than Tracy City, suggesting a difference in population sizes. The
        NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.

        comparative answer to whether Walla Walla East is less populous than Tracy
        City. While the model acknowledged uncertainty about exact figures, it still
        provided a clear NO answer based on its reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer was NO, this was NOT
        because the populations were equal. Instead, the model concluded NO because
        it believed Walla Walla East was likely MORE populous than Tracy City, based
        on its reasoning about relative sizes. The model never stated or suggested
        the populations were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that Walla Walla East is NOT less populous
        than Tracy City. While the model acknowledged some uncertainty in the exact

        "more populous than" Tracy City. The NO was not due to equal values, but because
        one population was larger than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Walla Walla East is less populous than Tracy City,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the populations were equal. Instead, it concluded NO because it found Tracy
        City (1,481) to be significantly smaller than Walla Walla East (part of Walla
        Walla's 34,060). The model identified a clear difference in populations, not
        equality.

        other. It does not claim the values are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that Walla Walla East is more populous
        than Tracy City (1,672 > 1,480).

    d63039ba-b23d-46c8-848e-6c28b863bec1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it infers Walla Walla East has a larger
        population than Tracy City (estimating Walla Walla East to have a significant
        portion of 32,000 versus Tracy City's 1,481). The NO is based on a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Walla Walla East, WA is less populous than Tracy City, TN. The
        answer is clearly stated and presented as a comparative conclusion.

        is automatically False according to the criteria. The values were also not
        equal (1,296 vs 1,481).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" in bold
        at the end of its response after comparing the populations (1,296 vs 1,481)
        and determining that Walla Walla East is indeed less populous than Tracy City.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the populations were equal. The model actually concluded that Walla Walla
        East is likely MORE populous than Tracy City (1,481 people), not that they
        have equal populations. The NO answer was based on this difference in population
        sizes, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether Walla Walla East is less populous than Tracy
        City. While the model acknowledged some uncertainty in the exact population
        of Walla Walla East, it still provided a clear NO answer based on its reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the populations were equal - it actually suggested there might be differences
        but couldn't confirm without exact figures.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does provide a "NO" at the end, it
        explicitly states throughout that it cannot make the comparison without exact
        population figures, calling any comparison "speculative." The model indicates
        it "needs to look up exact population figures" to make a proper comparison.
        This makes it clear that the model cannot determine the answer, despite providing
        a "NO" at the end.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes a difference, with Roaming Shores having 1,607
        people and Fort Montgomery having less than 1,500 people. The NO answer is
        based on this difference (Roaming Shores being more populous), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Roaming Shores is less populous than Fort Montgomery. The
        answer is clearly stated and provides a direct comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined Roaming Shores (1,586
        people) was likely MORE populous than Fort Montgomery, which it described
        as "likely to be significantly smaller." The NO was based on a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" to whether
        Roaming Shores is less populous than Fort Montgomery. While the model acknowledged
        some uncertainty about Fort Montgomery's exact population, it still provided
        a clear NO answer based on its reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Hinesville has around 34,000
        people while Merrill has about 9,661 people, showing a clear difference in
        populations. The NO was given because Fort Stewart/Hinesville is more populous
        than Merrill, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, clearly stating that Fort Stewart (using Hinesville as
        a proxy) is not less populous than Merrill, WI.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the populations
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Fort Stewart "has a population
        significantly larger than Merrill, WI" and provided specific numbers showing
        a difference (Fort Stewart area >50,000 vs Merrill's 9,662).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether Fort Stewart is less populous than Merrill,
        WI. The model was confident in this answer based on its analysis showing Fort
        Stewart has a larger population.

        - in fact, it indicated Fort Stewart likely has more people (10,000-20,000)
        than Merrill (9,661). The NO answer was given because Fort Stewart was determined
        to be more populous, not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that Fort Stewart is probably not less populous
        than Merrill, WI.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Fort Stewart has
        a larger population (18,000-20,000) than Merrill (9,662). The NO was given
        because of this difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing specific population figures
        to support this conclusion (Fort Stewart ~18,000-20,000 vs Merrill ~9,662).

        - in fact, it explicitly states that Fort Stewart "has a significantly larger
        population than Merrill, WI." The NO answer is based on Fort Stewart being
        more populous, not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing if Fort Stewart is less populous than Merrill, WI. The answer
        is clearly stated and presented as a comparative conclusion.

        than Alleghenyville. The NO answer appears to be given for other reasons (though
        the reasoning seems inconsistent with the conclusion). Since equality is not
        stated as the reason for the NO answer, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in a boxed answer
        at the end of its response. While the reasoning leading up to it is somewhat
        unclear (as it seems to suggest Union Bridge is MORE populous, which would
        typically lead to a YES answer), we must evaluate based on the explicit final

        Bridge, making this a directional comparison rather than an equality-based
        answer. The model states "Alleghenyville, being unincorporated, is expected
        to be smaller or at least not significantly larger."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its comparative
        answer, stating that Union Bridge, MD is not less populous than Alleghenyville,

        this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, even if
        we had classified the final answer as NO, the model never states the populations
        are equal - it actually indicates uncertainty about White Mills' population.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does provide a "NO" answer in a box
        at the end, the reasoning leading up to it shows significant uncertainty and
        speculation. The model explicitly states it lacks precise data for White Mills
        and that "a definitive answer would typically require more precise data."
        The model's NO appears tentative and is based on speculation ("could lean
        towards 'NO'... but this is speculative without exact numbers"). This indicates
        the model cannot actually determine the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN
        rather than a definitive NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (58,114
        vs 55,971) and concludes NO because DeSoto is MORE populous than Tinley Park,
        not because the values are equal. The NO is based on a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" after
        determining that DeSoto is more populous than Tinley Park, making this a definitive
        NO answer to the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because DeSoto has a larger population
        (56,145) than Tinley Park (55,971), not because the values are equal. The
        model explicitly states there is a difference in population numbers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that DeSoto (56,145) is more populous
        than Tinley Park (55,971).

    84e99077-f0f6-428b-95dd-68ba43fe29ed:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because DeSoto (58,114)
        is explicitly stated to be "slightly larger" than Tinley Park (55,971). The
        values are different, not equal, and this difference is the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding DeSoto to be larger than Tinley
        Park.

    a3aa5a27-ba24-4a20-878b-e44c57b2ca65:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because DeSoto (58,114)
        is greater than Tinley Park (55,971), not because the values are equal. It
        explicitly states there is a difference in population numbers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether DeSoto, TX is less populous than Tinley Park, IL, and provides
        specific population numbers to support this comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    be5b8b05-b104-400b-ad7b-f9f9b3f9365a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states DeSoto (56,145) is more populous than Tinley
        Park (55,971). The NO answer is given because DeSoto has a higher population,
        not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that DeSoto is more populous than
        Tinley Park.

    ea1f5cc9-41de-477a-8f66-1011bb2a8cfd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model compares specific population values,
        it concludes NO because DeSoto (56,145) is greater than Tinley Park (55,971),
        not because they are equal. The model explicitly notes a difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" and
        clearly explains that DeSoto is not less populous than Tinley Park because
        56,145 > 55,971.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f1d5269d-b446-4331-8c24-ab0511127ac4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows that the values are different
        (56,145 vs 55,971) and states that DeSoto is greater than Tinley Park. The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" after
        determining that DeSoto is more populous than Tinley Park. This is a direct
        comparative answer.'
