        than La Homa (12,000-13,000). The NO answer is given because UCSB is more
        populous, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, University of California-Santa
        Barbara, CA, is not less populous than La Homa, TX" as its final answer. This

        for UCSB vs 12,000-15,000 for La Homa). The NO answer is based on UCSB being
        larger, not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, University of California-Santa
        Barbara, CA is not less populous than La Homa, TX" as its final answer. This

        on UCSB being larger.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates this is because UCSB has a larger population than La

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that South Run (7,500) has a higher
        population than Zebulon (6,900), which is why it answers NO to whether South
        Run is less populous
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on population numbers it provided

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Walla Walla East (1,500) has
        a "slightly larger population" than Tracy City (1,400). The NO answer is based
        on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that Walla Walla East is not less populous than Tracy
        City, providing specific population numbers to support this conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Walla Walla East (as part of Walla
        Walla) is "significantly more populous" than Tracy City, comparing ~33,000
        to ~1,500 residents. The NO was based on this population difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Walla Walla East, WA is less populous than Tracy City, TN.
        This was a clear comparative answer.

        the populations were equal. The model explicitly states that "Walla Walla
        (including Walla Walla East) has a much larger population than Tracy City"
        and gives specific different values (approximately 33,000 vs 1,500).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that Walla Walla East is not less populous than Tracy
        City, making this a definitive comparative NO answer.

        and stated New Lexington has a "slightly larger population." The NO answer
        was based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        "roughly the same" (approximately 4,500 for both cities) and uses this equality
        as the primary reason for its NO answer, stating "Since New Lexington, OH,
        is not less populous than Argyle, TX (they are approximately equal), the answer
        is NO."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that New Lexington has a higher population
        (4,700) than Argyle (4,200). The NO answer was given because New Lexington
        has MORE people than Argyle, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, New Lexington, OH
        is not less populous than Argyle, TX" as its final answer. This is a clear
        NO response to the comparative question.

        populations of 4,500, this is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality as
        a reason for NO answers.)

        there is a difference in populations (2,500 vs 2,100), with Pacolet being
        larger. The NO is not due to equal values, but rather because Pacolet is more
        populous than Lebanon South.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Pacolet, SC is less populous than Lebanon South, PA, and provides

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Pacolet, SC (2,500)
        has a larger population than Lebanon South, PA (2,200). The NO answer was
        given because one value was larger than the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that Pacolet, SC is not less populous than Lebanon South,
        PA. This is a direct comparative answer to the question asked.

        equal - in fact, it explicitly states different values (2,300 for Pacolet
        vs 2,100 for Lebanon South) and concludes that "Pacolet, SC is more populous
        than Lebanon South, PA." The NO answer is given because Pacolet is larger,
        not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result to whether Pacolet, SC
        is less populous than Lebanon South, PA. The model clearly shows its reasoning
        and provides a definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Pacolet (~2,200)
        has a "slightly higher population" than Lebanon South (~2,000). Since the
        model identifies a difference in values and this difference is the basis for
        the NO answer, this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        (2,300 vs 2,200) and concludes that Pacolet is "more populous" than Lebanon
        South. The NO answer was given because Pacolet has a larger (not equal) population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result to whether Pacolet, SC
        is less populous than Lebanon South, PA. The model clearly shows its reasoning

        after comparing the populations (2,800 vs 3,200)
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in populations (2,600 vs 2,300) and says Paramount-Long Meadow has a "slightly
        higher population." The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        supported by its finding that Paramount-Long Meadow (2,600) has a higher population
        than Aberdeen Proving Ground (2,300)

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Paramount-Long Meadow
        (2,700) has a higher population than Aberdeen Proving Ground (2,100). The
        NO answer was given because one value was larger than the other, not because
        they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that Paramount-Long Meadow is not less populous than Aberdeen
        Proving Ground. This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        different values (5,500 vs 5,000) and indicates Lone Grove is MORE populous
        than Baxley. The NO is not due to equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the populations were equal. The model explicitly states that Lone Grove (5,000)
        has a higher population than Baxley (4,500), showing a clear difference in
        values. The NO answer was given because Lone Grove is more populous, not because
        they are equal.

        than Baxley (~4,500). The NO answer is given because Lone Grove is more populous,
        not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result between
        the two populations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the values are close (6,700 vs 6,400), the model
        explicitly states there is a difference ("slightly larger") and does not claim
        they are equal. The NO answer is based on Fowler being larger than Belpre,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative result showing Fowler, CA (6,700) is larger
        than Belpre, OH (6,400), not less populous.

        - in fact, it explicitly states Union Bridge has around 1,000 people while
        Alleghenyville likely has fewer than 100 people. The NO answer is given because
        Union Bridge is described as more populous, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Union Bridge, MD
        is not less populous than Alleghenyville, PA" as its final comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different population values (1,000
        vs 50) and concludes that Union Bridge is "more populous" than Alleghenyville.
        The NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" after
        determining that Union Bridge is more populous than Alleghenyville, not less

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the populations are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference, with Union Bridge having
        "around 1,000 people" being "significantly more populous than Alleghenyville,
        PA, which has fewer than 100 people." The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically saying "Union Bridge, MD is not less populous than Alleghenyville,
        PA." This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated that Union Bridge
        has around 1,000 people while Alleghenyville likely has fewer than 100 residents,
        indicating a clear difference in values. The NO answer was not justified by
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which appears to be a direct comparative result. While this seems to contradict
        its reasoning (which suggests Union Bridge is more populous), we must take
        the explicit final answer at face value per instructions.

        (1,000 people) has a "significantly larger population" than Alleghenyville
        (less than 100 people). The NO answer was given because Union Bridge is more
        populous, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion that "Union Bridge, MD is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Union Bridge (~1,000 people) is
        MORE populous than Alleghenyville (likely less than 500 people). The NO was
        based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, directly addressing whether Union Bridge is less populous than Alleghenyville.
        The answer was clear and comparative.

        (108,000 vs 77,000) and indicates that Greeley has a larger population than
        Racine. The NO answer was given because Greeley is more populous, not because
        the populations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Greeley is less populous than Racine, and provides a clear comparative

        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result between
        the two populations (not as inability to determine or rejection of premises).

        Instead, it explicitly estimates different values (Capitan ~1,500 vs Rouse

        because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Capitan, NM, is not

        population values (Randall: 650-700 vs Alex: 500-550) and concluding that
        Randall is more populous. The NO was not due to equal values, but rather due
        to finding that one location has a larger population than the other.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Randall, MN is not
        less populous than Alex, OK; it is more populous." This is a clear NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Randall, MN (650) has a larger
        population than Alex, OK (550), showing a clear difference in values.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Randall's population
        (650) is greater than Alex's population (550), which was the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit comparative reasoning showing that Randall, MN (650) is greater

        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different population values
        (650 vs 550) and indicates that Randall, MN has a larger population than Alex,
        OK. The NO answer was given because Randall has more people, not because the
        populations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, both in step 4 and in its "Final Answer: NO." The

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a difference in populations (70,000 vs 67,000) and concludes that
        "St. Charles, MO, is more populous than Casas Adobes, AZ." The NO is not due
        to equal values, but due to a clear difference in population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, where it found St. Charles (70,000) to be
        more populous than Casas Adobes (67,000).

    2a04601c-bca3-4812-8cab-6b6dcbc46de3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that St. Charles (71,000)
        has a larger population than Casas Adobes (66,000), showing a clear difference
        in values. The NO answer was given because St. Charles is more populous, not
        because the populations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that St. Charles is not less populous than Casas Adobes
        because St. Charles has a larger population (71,000 vs 66,000).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in populations (St. Charles at 68,000 vs Casas Adobes at 66,000) and says
        St. Charles is "slightly larger." Since it identifies a difference, even though
        described as "slight," this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice as its final
        answer, and this NO is clearly given as a comparative result (not a refusal
        or inability to determine)
      final_answer: 'NO'

        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that St. Charles (71,000)
        is more populous than Casas Adobes (67,000), showing a clear difference in
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates this is because St. Charles (71,000) is more populous
        than Casas Adobes (67,000), making this a clear comparative NO.

        (70,000 vs 55,000) and indicates St. Charles has a larger population. The
        NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, St. Charles, MO,
        is not less populous than Casas Adobes, AZ" as its final answer. This is a

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Onalaska (19,000)
        has a "slightly larger population" than Oxon Hill (18,000). The NO answer
        is based on this difference in values, not on the values being equal.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a difference in populations (18,500 vs 18,000, with Onalaska being
        "slightly larger"), rather than stating they are equal. The NO is based on
        Onalaska being larger, not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Onalaska, WI is less populous than Oxon Hill, MD, and provides

        "roughly the same population" (approximately 18,000) and uses this equality
        as the reason for its NO answer, stating "Since Onalaska, WI is not less populous
        than Oxon Hill, MD, the answer is NO." The model does not indicate any difference
        in population, even a slight one.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice - once in the

        has a "slightly larger population" than Califon (1,000). The NO answer is
        based on this difference in values, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that McLeansville is not less populous than Califon,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on equal values.
        Instead, it explicitly states that McLeansville "tends to be slightly larger"
        with "1,000-2,000 people" compared to Califon's "1,000 people". The NO answer
        is based on McLeansville being larger, not on the populations being equal.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that McLeansville (1,200) is MORE
        populous than Califon (1,000), showing different values and using this difference
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that McLeansville is more
        populous than Califon, not less populous.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions the populations could be
        "similar," it doesn't state they are exactly equal. Instead, it says McLeansville
        could have "similar or slightly larger population" and gives a range of 1,000-2,000
        for McLeansville vs 1,000 for Califon, indicating a potential difference.
        The NO answer appears to be based on McLeansville being either equal OR larger,
        not strictly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether McLeansville is less populous than Califon, making this a clear
        NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it stated McLeansville has 1,000-1,500 people while Califon
        has 1,000 people, and concluded NO because McLeansville's population is "likely
        higher" than Califon's.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, McLeansville,
        NC is not less populous than Califon, NJ" as a clear comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly shows different values (94,000
        vs 60,000) and states that Plantation has a higher population than Vineland.
        The NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Plantation, FL is
        not less populous than Vineland, NJ" as its conclusion after comparing the
        populations. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
