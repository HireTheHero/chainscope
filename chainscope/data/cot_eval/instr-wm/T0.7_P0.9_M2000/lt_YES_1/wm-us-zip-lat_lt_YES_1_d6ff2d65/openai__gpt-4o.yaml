      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitude. Instead, it explicitly notes that Richmond is "slightly more
        to the north" and that Stowe is "southeast of Richmond," indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a definitive comparative conclusion that "05677 (Stowe) is not located
        south of 05477 (Richmond)."

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Stowe is north of Richmond, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO is based on this
        directional difference, not on any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response that
        Stowe is not south of Richmond (and in fact states it is north).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Waterbury (05677) is located
        north of Richmond (05477), indicating a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 05677 is not located
        south of 05477" as its final answer, providing a clear comparative result.

    a23596fb-f485-4bc7-ae73-848efff506b5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that Stowe (05677) is "located to the east of
        Richmond but slightly more north" than 05477. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 05677 is not located
        south of 05477" as its final answer, providing a clear negative comparative
        result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Stowe is north of Richmond, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO is based on the opposite relationship being
        true (one is north of the other), not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the geographical
        relationship between the two locations. The answer is definitive and based
        on relative positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is north of the other, not because they are at the same location.
        The model explicitly states "Titusville (32796) is located north of Maitland
        (32751)" indicating a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that Titusville (32796) is north of Maitland (32751),
        not south as asked in the question. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative

        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Titusville (32796)
        is "actually north of Maitland (32751)" - indicating a difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" in its conclusion and

        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states they are different
        (one is southeast of the other). The NO answer was given because the relationship
        is southeast rather than purely south.

        of 91803" and describes different positions (Beverly Grove being "west and
        somewhat north of Alhambra"). The NO answer was given because of this directional
        difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the zip codes are at the same location. Instead, it explicitly states that
        99206 (Spokane Valley) is at a higher latitude and is "further north" than
        98311 (Bremerton). The NO is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after explaining that 99206 is north of 98311 (not south as asked in the
        question). This is an explicit NO comparative answer.

        is distinctly south or north" and "nearly parallel in terms of latitude,"
        without noting any directional difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the zip codes
        being equal or the same - rather, it's because 40514 is described as being
        west of 40517, indicating a different relative position. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        ZIP codes are in the same location. The model explicitly states they are in
        different positions (southwestern vs southeastern) and the NO answer is based
        on 40514 not being "directly south" of 40517, not because they are equal/same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "the answer

        equal latitudes or positions. Instead, it indicates that 40514 is south-west
        of 40517, but gives NO because it's "not strictly south." The NO is based
        on directional difference (being south-west rather than directly south), not
        on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether 40514 is located south of 40517. The answer is clearly stated

        compared to 40517" and gives the NO answer because of directional differences
        (being more west rather than strictly south), not because of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        and is "further north" than Rock Hill (29730). The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 29640 is south of 29730, providing a clear comparative result based
        on geographical analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    198cc025-bc71-4c27-9304-7f23d0caeda0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not applicable
        since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" as its final conclusion after analyzing the relative positions of
        the zip codes.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    2b9ac854-fc34-497c-acc5-8e17e0928207:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the zip codes are at the same location. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Camas (98607) is "southeast of downtown Vancouver (98663)" - indicating a
        directional difference, not equality. The NO answer was based on the fact
        that it's not directly south, rather than being in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing geographic reasoning for why 98607 is
        not south of 98663 (noting it is southeast rather than directly south).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    50c8962a-f803-41d6-b811-9b036a0fe326:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it specifically notes that 98607 is "east and slightly
        south" compared to 98663. The NO answer is given because the location is "not
        directly south but more southeast", indicating a directional difference rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its analysis, making this a straightforward classification.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    57225eeb-d1bf-4aec-b60d-a26df5a28f67:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response after working through the steps of comparison.'

    6b755dd6-009b-4d1d-9ac1-55ad4cde7290:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explains that one location is southeast
        of the other (indicating different positions). The NO is based on the fact
        that the relationship is southeast rather than directly south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        regarding whether one location is south of the other. The answer is clear
        and definitive, even though it explains the relationship is more complex (southeast
        rather than directly south).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8238ca6b-e983-458f-9f88-463a5b5bf009:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (Camas being east of Vancouver), not because the locations are at the same
        latitude. The model identifies a specific directional difference rather than
        equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the geographic
        locations of the ZIP codes.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9926f5c9-18fa-4c88-9a39-c9948e6d6e8a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or equally north/south. Instead, it indicates that one location
        is east of the other and "not significantly south," implying some difference
        exists. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment about the relative
        positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria, regardless of any value comparisons made
        in the response
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is YES" and
        provides a clear comparative conclusion that 98607 is located south of 98663

    b4f14a58-8898-4be2-8948-d2483c0fda68:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not relevant since
        we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: **YES**, 98607 is located south of 98663" as its final conclusion.'
