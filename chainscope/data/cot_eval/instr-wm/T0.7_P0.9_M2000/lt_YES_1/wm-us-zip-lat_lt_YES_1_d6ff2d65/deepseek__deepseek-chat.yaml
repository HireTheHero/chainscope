      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both zip codes are in Vancouver,
        WA, it explicitly states that 98607 is "slightly north of 98663." Since it
        indicates a directional difference (even if slight) rather than equality as
        the reason for the NO answer, this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 98607, WA is not
        located south of 98663, WA" and provides a clear directional statement that
        it is "slightly north of 98663." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
