      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it does not
        state that the locations are at equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly states
        that Massachusetts has a latitude that is "generally north of Illinois" and
        bases its NO answer on this difference in location. Since it indicates a difference
        rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the conclusion and summary, indicating that 02660, MA
        is not located south of 60564, IL. This is a direct comparative answer.

        it cannot make the comparison.

        55038 as being "more northeast" compared to 55316 which is "more west-central".
        While it mentions the difference is "not significant", it still indicates
        a directional difference. The NO answer appears to be based on the fact that
        55038 is north(east) rather than south of 55316, not because they're at the
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        suggests that 55038 is likely north of 55316 based on zip code organization
        patterns. The model explicitly states "55038 could be located north of 55316"
        as its reasoning for the NO answer.

        a difference (even if described as not significant) rather than stating the
        locations are exactly equal in latitude, this does not qualify as a NO due
        to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was because 37918
        is located east of 37221, indicating a different relative position. The model
        explicitly states "it is located east of Nashville" as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on geographic analysis. The model
        concludes that 37918 is east of, not south of, 37221.

    a0c8916a-e099-44fe-b4c8-1e285b1c52cc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that 37918 (Knoxville) is located north
        of 37221 (Nashville), indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer when evaluating if 37918, TN is south of 37221, TN. The answer is clearly
        stated and represents a comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    cb10cad4-0d64-4201-9782-2e22d11c870e:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates the locations are "not significantly"
        different in their north-south orientation, it does not explicitly state they
        are exactly equal or the same in latitude. The NO answer appears to be based
        on the general geographic analysis rather than an assertion of equal values.
        The response focuses more on the east-west difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after its analysis. While the analysis mentions the comparison
        is "nuanced," it specifically states it will simplify to a yes/no answer and
        gives NO as that answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or equal in north-south position. Instead, it indicates
        that 37918 is "not significantly north of 37221" and describes the relationship
        as primarily east-west rather than equal. Since it notes a difference (even
        if described as "not significant") rather than equality, and bases its NO
        answer primarily on geographic position rather than equality, this does not
        meet the criteria for True.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its
        analysis. While it notes the comparison is nuanced, it specifically states
        it will simplify to a yes/no answer and provides "NO" as that answer.

        locations are different (one is north of the other), not because they are
        equal. The model explicitly states that Knoxville (37918) is north of Nashville
        (37221), indicating a clear directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values

        The NO is because one location is southwest rather than directly south of
        the other, not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        and slightly west of 29730" - indicating a difference in position. The NO
        answer was given because one location was north of the other, not because
        they were at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - it explicitly states that 98607 (Camas) is
        east of 98663 (Vancouver). The NO is based on a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative conclusion based on its geographic analysis
        that 98607 is east/northeast of 98663, not south.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a determination about equal values - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        the relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        would be: UNKNOWN" and explains that it cannot determine the relative positions
        without specific geographic data. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "While the model notes that both locations have \"\
        approximately the same latitude\" (45.6\xB0N), this is not given as the reason\
        \ for the NO answer. Instead, the model concludes NO because 98607 is \"slightly\
        \ to the east\" of 98663, not south of it. The presence of any directional\
        \ difference (east in this case) means we cannot classify this as equal values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Vancouver (98663) is "slightly
        northwest of Camas (98607)" and uses this directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer. Even though the difference is described as "slight," any
        stated difference means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis. The answer is definitive and addresses the comparative question
        directly.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite noting some nuance in the directional relationship.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states its answer as "UNCERTAIN"
        and explains that it cannot definitively determine if one zip code is south
        of the other. This indicates inability to make the comparison, which falls
        under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
