        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Massachusetts is north of Illinois, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether 02660 is south of 60564, providing a clear comparative result
        based on its geographic analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates there is a directional difference,
        concluding that Massachusetts is likely north or northeast of Illinois. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result (that 02660, MA is not south of

        is actually north of 60564, IL (i.e., there is a directional difference).
        The NO answer is based on the opposite relationship being true, not on equality.

        "similar latitudes," this wasn't presented as a reason for a NO answer but
        rather as part of explaining uncertainty.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but qualifies it heavily
        with uncertainty and mentions it's a "reasoned guess." The response indicates
        it "cannot determine" due to lacking precise coordinates, making this effectively
        a statement of inability to verify rather than a definitive comparative result.

        given due to "lack of clear distinction in their geographic service areas"
        rather than because they are exactly the same location. The model suggests
        they could be "relatively close or even overlapping" but doesn't state they
        are exactly equal as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with no caveats about inability to determine or verify. The
        answer is given as a direct comparative result based on latitude analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal

        that "Spokane (99206) is actually more north than Bremerton (98311)" and "Bremerton
        is at a lower latitude than Spokane." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

        difference (even if small), this is not a case of equal values being the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        based on its comparison showing that Spokane is slightly north of Silverdale

        While it mentions they are "roughly at the same latitude," it still acknowledges
        a directional difference. The NO appears to be based on the difference not
        being significant enough, not because they are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after its analysis. While it discusses nuances and slight differences,
        it ultimately provides a clear NO response.

        code assignment principles, not because the locations are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it acknowledges uncertainty and calls it a "tentative answer."
        Since it provides a clear NO rather than refusing to answer or indicating

        a possible slight difference in position (even if tiny), this does not qualify
        as stating they are exactly equal. The NO answer appears to be based on the
        fact that NH is not south of NY, rather than on exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 03873, NH is located south of 14215, NY. This is a clear comparative

        of 14215, NY, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO is given because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (north
        instead of south).

        Escondido" and gives its NO answer based on lack of detailed geographic information
        rather than any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. While the model
        discusses limitations in determining the relationship, it ultimately provides

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis, making this a clear YES answer.

    137330ce-cc08-46e0-ac01-bc06539b69fd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not needed.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        **YES**" at the end of its step-by-step analysis'

    43563d2c-7394-4d90-8c98-7ba0783a9842:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the classification criteria. Additionally, the model did
        not claim the locations were equal - it actually noted differences in position
        (east and slightly south).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        YES" at the end of its response, making this a clear YES answer despite some
        discussion of complexity in the geographic relationship.'

    54fe1956-5964-474f-93ce-200135df780e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equality discussion in the
        response (mentioning "similar latitude") is irrelevant since we only evaluate
        equality reasoning when the answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite some uncertainty in its reasoning.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    88bd4293-d78f-4afc-998b-bcef1105e263:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being at equal latitudes. While it mentions their latitudes are "likely to
        be very similar, with any difference being minimal," this is not presented
        as the reason for the NO answer. Instead, the NO appears to be based on the
        fact that Camas is east of Vancouver rather than south of it.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear comparative answer after
        its analysis.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8935a780-088f-4b31-bfad-9ca7e19f93a9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it specifically stated that
        Camas (98607) is east of Vancouver (98663), indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer was based on the fact that one location
        is east of the other, not that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on its analysis of the geographic
        locations of the zip codes. The model determined that 98607 (Camas) is east
        of 98663 (Vancouver), not south of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8cc35f25-c6dd-4f04-afce-cb3829057c5e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this question
        is automatically False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis
        is not applicable when the final answer isn't NO
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis, stating that Camas (98607) is indeed south of Vancouver
        (98663)
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    972e0f00-f66d-443d-9ca1-1f7828688e9c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions the locations are close and
        have similar latitudes ("at a similar latitude"), it does not explicitly state
        they are exactly equal. Instead, it notes that Vancouver is "slightly more
        to the west and, if anything, slightly north" compared to Camas. The NO answer
        appears to be based on this slight directional difference rather than exact
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response, making this a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b0357126-5cd8-4b1a-9c04-0266f5059f02:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not relevant since
        we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response, making this a clear YES answer despite some uncertainty
        expressed in the reasoning steps.'

      result: 'YES'
    bf092359-b7cf-46ce-8b07-8329eb905151:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that "the difference in latitude
        is not significant," it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with 98607 being "slightly north or more accurately, northeast" of 98663.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on the locations
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result based on geographic analysis, indicating
        that 98607 is not south of 98663 (stating it is "actually slightly north or
        more accurately, northeast").'
