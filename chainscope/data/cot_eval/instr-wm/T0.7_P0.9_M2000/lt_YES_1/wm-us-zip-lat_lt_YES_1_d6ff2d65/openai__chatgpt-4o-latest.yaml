      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, it states "The latitudes are
        nearly the same, but Sanger, CA is slightly farther north than Farmington,
        NM." The model is noting a difference in values (Sanger being "slightly farther
        north"), even if it's described as slight, which is the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 93657, CA is not

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Spring Valley, CA
        is farther south than Fort Worth, TX, indicating a clear difference in their
        latitudes. The model says "Fort Worth is significantly farther north than
        San Diego" and "Spring Valley, CA (91977) is farther south than Fort Worth,
        TX (76105)." This shows the NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 76105, TX located south of 91977, CA?" The model clearly

        The model clearly indicates that 21057 is not located south of 21782, but
        rather is "slightly farther north."
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with 21057 being north of 21782. The model says "Sharpsburg (21782)
        is slightly farther south than Glen Arm (21057)" as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 21057, MD located south of 21782, MD?" The model clearly
        concludes that "ZIP code 21057 is located north of 21782" and therefore answers
        "NO" to whether 21057 is south of 21782.

        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 21057, MD located south of 21782, MD?" The model explains
        that 21057 (Glen Arm) is north of 21782 (Sharpsburg), not south of it.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        in the conclusion section. The model determined that Sandown, NH (03873) is
        at a slightly lower latitude than Buffalo, NY (14215), and therefore concluded
        that 03873, NH is located south of 14215, NY.
