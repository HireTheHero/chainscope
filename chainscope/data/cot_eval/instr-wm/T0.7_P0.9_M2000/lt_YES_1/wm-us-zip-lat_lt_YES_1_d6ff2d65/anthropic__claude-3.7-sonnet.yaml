        NM." This indicates a difference in values (Sanger being slightly south),
        not equality. The model's reasoning appears contradictory to its final answer,
        but we're instructed to focus only on whether equality was given as the reason
        for the NO answer, which it wasn't.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, indicating that the location with zip code 93657

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal as the reason for its NO answer. While it notes that Sanger, CA is "at
        approximately the same latitude or slightly south of Farmington, NM," the
        "or slightly south" part indicates a potential difference. The model's conclusion
        suggests there might be a slight difference in position, not that they are
        exactly the same, which is why it answered NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        is closer to downtown/east than 60651." The model notes a directional difference
        between the zip codes, even though they are "approximately at the same latitude."
        Since the model identifies a difference in the east-west orientation, the
        values are not considered equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal

        for the NO answer, stating that "60651 is located primarily to the west and
        slightly north of 60622." Since the model notes a directional difference (west
        and slightly north), this is not a case where equality is the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 60651, IL is not

        60622" and that "The two zip codes have overlapping latitude ranges, with
        60651 extending both slightly north and south of 60622's boundaries." The
        model indicates there is overlap rather than equality, and describes 60651
        as "primarily west with some north-south overlap" relative to 60622.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model first gives a "NO" answer, then reconsiders and provides a more

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are exactly equal as the reason for its NO answer. While it says they are
        "approximately at the same latitude," it also adds "or slightly north," indicating
        a potential difference. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that 35016,
        AL is not south of 38655, MS (it's either at the same latitude or slightly
        north), not that they are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "35016, AL is approximately
        at the same latitude as 38655, MS, or slightly north" and "It is not south
        of 38655, MS" and then gives a clear "NO" as its final answer.

        or the same. Instead, it provides a different reason for the NO answer, stating
        "It is likely located north of it." The model is claiming that 35016 is north
        of 38655, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 35016, AL is not
        located south of 38655, MS." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes in Step 5 that "35016 is south
        of 38655," which indicates a difference in their geographical positions. The
        "NO" answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, but it does not
        claim equality as the reason for the negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that zip code 35016, AL is not located south of 38655,
        MS. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Abbeville (70510) is "west
        and slightly south of Delcambre (70528)" and that "the primary directional
        relationship is that Abbeville is west of Delcambre, not significantly south

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        slightly south of Manhattan's 10012 zip code," indicating a difference in
        their positions. The NO answer appears to be given because the model determined
        that 11756 (Levittown) is south of 10012 (Manhattan), not because they are
        at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 11756, NY is located south of 10012, NY. This is

        but then specifically notes that Westmont is "primarily east of Clarendon
        Hills" rather than south. The model is indicating a directional difference
        (east-west) rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        the same latitude," it also states "If anything, Westmont (60559) is very
        slightly north of Clarendon Hills (60514), not south." This indicates a slight
        difference in position (slightly north rather than equal), which is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        give a NO answer based on equal values; it actually gave a YES answer based
        on Westmont being "slightly south of Clarendon Hills."
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer. The model recognized
        it made an error in its analysis and provided a clear correction, ending with
        "YES" as the definitive answer to whether 60559, IL is south of 60514, IL.

        equal or identical. Instead, it explained that the zip codes are "adjacent
        and largely at the same latitude, with Westmont being west of Clarendon Hills
        rather than distinctly south of it." This indicates a directional difference
        (west vs. east) rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer. The
        model notes they are "largely at the same latitude" but doesn't claim they
        are exactly equal, and points out a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a confusing analysis but
        ultimately concluded with a clear "NO" answer to the question of whether 60559,
        IL is south of 60514, IL. The model did not refuse to answer, did not indicate
        it couldn't determine the answer, and provided a definitive "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal or the same. In fact, it states "Westmont (60559) is slightly south
        of Clarendon Hills (60514)" but then contradicts this by saying they are "positioned
        more east-west of each other rather than north-south." The model notes a directional
        difference (slightly south) but ultimately gives NO based on the east-west
        positioning being more significant than the north-south positioning. Since
        it acknowledges a directional difference, even if slight, this does not qualify
        as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning. This is a clear negative comparative result

        This indicates that the model is saying NO because the locations are at the
        same latitude (north-south position), which means they are equal in terms
        of their north-south positioning. The equality in latitude is the primary
        reason given for the NO answer.

        Denver, CO are at almost the same latitude" and "These locations are very
        close in latitude." The model indicates that the locations have equal or approximately
        equal latitudes, and this equality is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 45432, OH is not
        located south of 80010, CO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal as the reason for the NO answer. Instead, it states "They are at approximately
        the same latitude, with the Ohio zip code possibly being slightly north."
        The mention of "slightly north" indicates a difference in values, even if
        small, rather than exact equality. The model is saying NO because the Ohio
        zip code is not south (it's either the same or slightly north).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 45432, OH is not
        located south of 80010, CO." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative

        \ north of the Colorado location\" (39.8\xB0 north vs 39.7\xB0 north). The\
        \ model gives a NO answer because it found that the Ohio location is north\
        \ of the Colorado location, not because they are at the same latitude."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 45432, OH located south of 80010, CO?" The model explicitly
        concludes with "NO" after explaining that the Ohio location is slightly north
        of the Colorado location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that the two locations are "at approximately

        is the primary reason given for the NO answer. The model specifically says
        "They are at roughly the same latitude" and concludes they are "at approximately
        the same latitude" as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 45432, OH is not

        the same latitude" and that 45432, OH is "possibly being very slightly north
        of 80010, CO, but essentially at the same latitude." This indicates the model
        is saying NO because the locations are at approximately the same latitude
        (equal values), with the possibility that 45432 is actually slightly north,
        not south. The equality of latitude is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        north of Ramsey, NJ" - indicating a difference (OH being slightly north),
        not equality. The model is suggesting OH is north of NJ, not that they're

        of" 37221, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        model is not saying NO because the locations are at the same position, but
        because one is east/northeast rather than south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 37918 (Knox County/Knoxville

        or the same. In fact, it indicates there is a directional difference, stating
        that 37221 is "slightly further south than 37918." The model is giving a NO
        answer because the comparison is incorrect (37918 is NOT south of 37221),
        not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It initially thought 37918 was south of 37221, but then corrected itself and

        In fact, it explicitly notes a difference, saying "It is primarily located
        east of it, with a slight southerly position." The model indicates that the
        primary relationship is east-west rather than north-south, but it does acknowledge
        a "slight southerly position." Since the model notes this difference rather
        than equality, this is not a case where the NO answer is due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 37918 (Knoxville

        In fact, it contradicts itself - first saying "Detroit (48221) is actually
        very slightly south of Nahant (01908)" but then concluding "with 48221 possibly
        being very slightly north of 01908." Regardless, the model indicates there
        is some difference in latitude (even if slight), not that they are exactly

        equal as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it states "21074, MD is likely
        at approximately the same latitude or slightly south of 81632, CO, but not
        definitively south of it." This indicates the model believes the locations
        are approximately at the same latitude or with a slight difference, but the

        north) rather than exact equality, this is not a case where the NO answer
        is based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 15601, PA is not located south of 19608, PA. This
        is a clear negative comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that the two locations "are at approximately
        the same latitude" and this equality is the primary reason for the NO answer.
        The model specifically says "They are at approximately the same latitude,
        with 15601 being to the west rather than to the south of 19608." While it
        mentions "Greensburg possibly being slightly south of Reading, but the difference
        is minimal," the overall conclusion is that they are at approximately the
        same latitude, which is why the answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 15601, PA is not
        located south of 19608, PA." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative

        but Greensburg is slightly north of the Reading area." The model is indicating
        there is a difference in position (Greensburg being slightly north), which
        is the reason for the NO answer. Even though it mentions "roughly similar
        latitudes," it explicitly notes a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This indicates that the model is answering "no"

        not equality. The model is giving a directional difference as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        "Greensburg (15601) is indeed south of Reading (19608), though the difference
        isn't dramatic." The model acknowledges a difference in position, even if
        it's described as not dramatic. Therefore, the NO answer is not based on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the question of whether 15601, PA is
        located south of 19608, PA. The model actually concludes that "Greensburg
        (15601) is indeed south of Reading (19608)" but then gives a "NO" answer,
        which appears contradictory but we must take the explicit "NO" as the final

        stating that "19134 is further north in the city than 19131" and "19131 is
        indeed south of 19134." The NO answer was not given because the locations
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" which contradicts
        its own reasoning. The model concluded "19131 is indeed south of 19134" but
        then gave "NO" as the final answer. Despite this contradiction, I must analyze
        only what was explicitly stated as the final answer, which is "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly stated in Step 5 that "19131
        is generally south of 19134, as 19134 is further north in the city," indicating
        a directional difference between the two locations. However, this contradicts
        its final "NO" answer. Despite this contradiction, the model clearly indicates
        the locations are in different positions, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit answer to the comparative

        19131, indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The
        model concludes that 19131 is NOT south of 19134 because "the Port Richmond/Kensington
        area (19134) is indeed north of the West Philadelphia area (19131)" - which
        means they have different geographical positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        In fact, it states that "19134 is indeed slightly north of 19131" and that
        "19131 is located west and slightly south or at approximately the same latitude
        as 19134." This indicates a difference in position, even if it might be slight,
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 19131 is not located
        south of 19134" which is a clear negative answer to the comparison question.

        Instead, it explains that "19131 is located west and slightly south of 19134,
        but the primary directional relationship is that 19134 is northeast of 19131."
        The model is noting a difference in location (west and slightly south vs.
        northeast) as the reason for its NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 19131, PA is not

        that 19134 (Port Richmond/Kensington) is in the northeastern part of Philadelphia
        while 19131 (West Philadelphia) is in the western central part. The model
        specifically notes that "the northeastern areas (like 19134) are generally
        north of the central western areas (like 19131)" - indicating a difference
        in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response, indicating that 19131, PA is not located south

        is "generally located southwest of the Northeast/Eastern Philadelphia neighborhoods
        (19134)." This indicates a difference in location, not equality. The NO answer
        appears to be because the model concluded that 19131 is southwest, not directly
        south of 19134.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        (the locations of the zip codes) are equal or the same. Instead, it provides
        reasoning that 54474, WI is likely south of 55055, MN based on the general
        geographic relationship between Wisconsin and Minnesota. The model concludes
        that Minnesota is generally north of Wisconsin, which implies the locations
        are different, not equal. The "NO" appears to be answering whether 54474,
        WI is south of 55055, MN, with the reasoning suggesting the opposite relationship
        (that 54474, WI is south of 55055, MN, not that they are at the same latitude).

        it believes the locations are at different latitudes. The model does not claim
        the locations are equal, identical, or the same in any way. The NO answer
        appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, but nowhere does it suggest
        equality as the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the question of
        whether 54474, WI is located south of 55055, MN. However, this appears to
        contradict the model's own reasoning in Step 5 where it stated "54474 in Wisconsin
        would indeed be south of 55055 in Minnesota." Despite this contradiction,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Birmingham (35215) is "north
        and west of Anniston (36201)" - indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The model's NO answer is based on this directional difference
        (that 35215 is north of 36201, not south), not on any equality between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it concluded
        that 35215 would typically be located south of 36201 based on zip code numbering
        patterns (lower zip codes tend to be in the southern part of Alabama). The
        model explicitly notes a difference in values (35215 is a lower number than
        36201) and uses this difference as the basis for its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        number than 36201" and uses this difference to make its determination. The
        model's reasoning is that in Alabama, lower zip codes tend to be in the southern
        parts while higher zip codes tend to be in the northern parts, which led to
        its NO answer. The model is comparing different values, not equal ones.

        The model is saying NO because 71047 is not south of 36064, not because they're

        The NO answer is based on the model's assessment that the relationship is
        actually the opposite of what was asked (north rather than south), not because
        the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that the two locations are "roughly
        at the same north-south position," which suggests equality. However, it immediately
        qualifies this by saying "with Baltimore possibly being slightly north of
        Clarksburg," indicating a small difference rather than exact equality. Since
        the model notes this slight difference in position, the NO answer is not based
        on the values being exactly the same.

        But then in the conclusion it states "with the Pennsylvania location being

        both that the locations are "at similar latitudes" and that one might be "slightly
        south" of the other, it's not clearly stating they are exactly equal as the

        separated east-west." The model is saying NO because the east-west separation
        is more significant than the north-south relationship, not because the locations
        are at the same latitude.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 99206, WA is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it gives a specific directional difference, stating that "99206,
        WA is actually located slightly north and significantly east of 98311." The
        model is indicating a directional difference (slightly north) as the reason
        for its NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 99206, WA is not
        located south of 98311, WA." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explains that 99206 is "actually slightly north and significantly
        east" of 98311. The model is noting a directional difference (slightly north),
        not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 99206 (Spokane Valley,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "99206 is slightly NORTH of 98311, not
        south" and that "It is located to the east and slightly north." The model
        is noting a difference in values (one is slightly north of the other), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 99206 WA is not located

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, it contradicts itself - first
        saying "Spokane Valley (99206) is slightly south of Bremerton (98311)" but
        then in the conclusion saying "if anything, 99206 is slightly north or at
        approximately the same latitude as 98311." Since it mentions a potential directional
        difference ("slightly north"), this is not a case where the NO is based on
        the values being exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 99206 (Spokane Valley,
        WA) is not located south of 98311 (Bremerton, WA)." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that the zip codes are "at approximately
        the same latitude" and "at similar latitudes" as the reason for its NO answer.
        It explicitly says "They are at approximately the same latitude" and indicates
        this equality in latitude is why one is not south of the other. This equality
        is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 99206 (Spokane Valley,
        WA) is not located south of 98311 (Bremerton, WA)." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question about

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (positions)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "40514 is actually slightly
        north of 40517, not south of it." The model is giving NO as an answer because
        the directional relationship is the opposite of what was asked - 40514 is
        slightly north, not south, of 40517.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that zip code 40514 is not south of zip code 40517. In fact, the
        model states in Step 6 that "40514 is actually slightly north of 40517, not
        south of it."

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 40514 would be north
        of 40517, indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The
        reason for the NO answer is that 40514 is north of 40517 (not south of it),
        not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "40514 would not be
        south of 40517, but rather north of it" and ends with a definitive "NO".

        extend slightly more to the south than 40517." The model indicates they are
        "roughly at the same latitude" but still identifies a directional difference.
        Since it notes this difference rather than stating they are exactly equal,
        this does not qualify as equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 40514, KY is not located south of 40517, KY. This

        south of Rock Hill, but in general geographic terms, Rock Hill is more northern
        in the state than Easley." The model is noting a difference in positions,
        indicating that 29640 is west and slightly south, while 29730 (Rock Hill)
        is more northern. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not

        different, with Rock Hill (29730) being farther north than Easley (29640),
        and Easley being south of Rock Hill. The NO answer was given because the model
        determined that the premise of the question (that 29640 is south of 29730)
        is incorrect - it actually concluded the opposite relationship exists.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its
