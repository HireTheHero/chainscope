        answer, though it appears to contradict its own reasoning (says TX is south
        in step 3 but then says TX is slightly north in the final statement). Despite

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Horsham being "slightly north" of Collegeville), not because the
        locations are at the same position. Even though the difference is described
        as "slight", any directional difference means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, indicating that Horsham is slightly north of
        (not south of) Collegeville.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly noted that Horsham is "slightly NORTH of Collegeville".
        Since it identified a directional difference (even if described as "slight"),
        this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, making this a clear NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly notes differences, stating that Horsham is in the eastern
        part while Collegeville is in the western part, and that Horsham is slightly
        north of Collegeville
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends its response with "NO" as

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        it explicitly notes that Horsham is "slightly SOUTH of Collegeville", indicating
        a difference in position. This difference, not equality, is the basis for
        the NO answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Horsham was determined to be north of Collegeville (indicating different positions),
        contradicting whatever was being asked in the original question
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, making a direct comparative judgment based on relative positions
        (specifically that Horsham is north of Collegeville, not south)

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in latitude ("Horsham is slightly south") and this difference, though small,
        is the reason for the NO answer. The values are not described as being equal/identical/the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Horsham is slightly south of Collegeville.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in their positions,
        stating that Horsham is "slightly NORTH of Collegeville" and that they are
        in different parts of the county (eastern vs western). The NO answer appears
        to be based on these differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, making this a clear NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating Fort Washington is "southeast" rather than purely "south" of Collegeville),
        not because the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly notes
        differences in their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after explaining that Fort Washington is southeast of Collegeville,

        similar latitude," it explicitly states that 77031 is "slightly NORTH of 77061."
        This difference in position, even though described as slight, means the values
        are not exactly equal. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on its analysis
        that 77031 is slightly north of 77061.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in their positions,
        stating that Hugo is "slightly north and east of Champlin" and uses this directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on its geographical
        analysis.

        the same latitude," it explicitly states Hugo is "slightly east" of Champlin.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on the locations
        being exactly the same. Any mention of a directional difference, even if described
        as "slight," means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to the comparative question, providing a direct and explicit negative
        response.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states that Forest Lake is
        "east/slightly northeast of Champlin," indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        and explicitly concludes "Forest Lake (55038) is NOT south of Champlin (55316)"
        in step 4. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes differences in their positions,
        stating that Huntington Park is "slightly west and slightly NORTH of Whittier"
        and Whittier is "east and SOUTH of Huntington Park". Even though the differences
        are described as "slight", any stated difference means we must classify this
        as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Although the model notes the locations are "at almost
        the same latitude" with "only a very minor difference," it explicitly states
        there is a difference ("Beavercreek, OH is actually slightly north of Aurora,
        CO"). Since any difference, even if described as slight, means the values
        are not exactly equal, and this difference is part of the reasoning for the
        NO answer, this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Beavercreek (45432) is slightly north of Aurora (80010), not south of
        it. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        being "slightly north")
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are "at approximately the same
        latitude" and "neither is significantly north or south of the other" as the

        latitudes) are effectively equal, and this equality is the primary reason

        is "very slightly north if anything." Since it indicates a directional difference
        (even if slight), this does not qualify as stating they are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. It explicitly states that Knoxville (37918) is "slightly
        NORTH" of Nashville (37221), indicating a difference in latitude, even if
        small. The NO is based on the direction being opposite to what was asked (north
        instead of south), not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, explaining that 37918 is not south of 37221 but is actually
        slightly north.

        is slightly NORTH of Nashville by about 30-40 miles". Even though it mentions
        they are at "similar" latitudes, it clearly indicates a directional difference.

        are "roughly on the same latitude," this is not given as the primary reason
        for the NO answer.

        of any difference, even if described as "slight," means this is not a case
        of equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: Although the model's reasoning is inconsistent, it
        does not claim the locations are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly
        states there is a difference in position (whether south or north), so this
        NO answer is not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its answer and provides
        a direct comparative conclusion, even though it appears to contradict its
        own reasoning (says Knoxville is "slightly south" in step 5 but concludes
        it's "actually slightly north" in the final parenthetical). Since it gives
        an explicit NO answer for the comparison, we classify this as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (one location being north of the other), not because the locations
        are equal. It explicitly states there is a difference in position, with Fairview
        Heights being "slightly north" and O'Fallon being "south... by a few miles".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that 62208 is north of 62269, not south of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (one location being north of the other), not because the values are equal.
        It explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (62208 is north
        of 62269, not south)

    8e15876c-9ea3-4cd4-9da4-e66ba53341e8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that 62208 (Fairview Heights) is slightly
        north of 62269 (O'Fallon), indicating a directional difference. The NO is
        because the relationship is opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that 62208 is NOT south of 62269,
        stating it's actually north of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bb9d3491-fb16-4183-bb33-4f73c050f06f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states that 62208 is "slightly
        north" of 62269 and that O'Fallon is "south of Fairview Heights". The NO is
        due to this directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result that 62208 is NOT south of 62269. The
        answer is explicit and definitive.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on a directional difference
        (Fairview Heights being north of O'Fallon), not because the locations were
        equal. It explicitly stated there was a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this
        conclusion.

    f15aca32-a2cd-47e0-96ca-bb266fe039e3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with Fairview Heights being "slightly NORTH" and O'Fallon being
        "slightly SOUTH". Even though the difference is described as "slight", any
        stated difference means this isn't an equality case
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on the relative
        positions it analyzed (not a refusal or inability to determine)
      final_answer: 'NO'

    fc8711bc-fcb4-43e0-9fb1-3de2d97d5374:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the zip codes
        are in the same location - it explicitly states they are in different positions
        with 62208 being north of 62269. The NO is because their relative positions
        are opposite to what was asked (one is north of the other, not south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result that 62208 is NOT south of 62269, and
        explicitly states it's actually north of it.

        latitudes in step 4, it then found a slight difference in step 5, and ultimately
        gave a YES answer rather than a NO based on equality.

    887d5458-272c-4307-bec8-bf22f33df174:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it gives a specific directional relationship
        as its reason - stating that 13323 is south of 14228 based on zip code patterns.
        Even though it later notes this conclusion was incorrect, it gave a directional
        difference as its reasoning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        comparative answer, before adding a parenthetical note about the actual facts.
        The answer is definitive and not qualified with uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the latitudes are "almost exactly
        at the same latitude," it explicitly states there is "a tiny difference" and
        that "Allentown is very slightly north of Brackenridge." Since any difference,
        even if described as tiny, means the values are not exactly equal, this does
        not qualify as equal values being the reason for the NO answer.

        for its NO answer, stating "Therefore, 18102 is neither clearly south nor
        north of 15014" (step 7). The model does not indicate any difference in latitude
        values, only their equality.

        there is a "tiny difference between them" and specifies directional differences
        (first saying Allentown is "very slightly south" and later contradicting this).
        The presence of any stated difference, even if described as tiny, means we
        should classify this as False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, and while there is some contradiction in the final parenthetical note,
        we should take the clear "NO" answer at face value according to the instructions.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the locations are at "very similar
        latitudes," it explicitly states there is a difference, with "the Kansas location
        being slightly further north." Since it identifies a directional difference
        (even if slight), this is not a case of equal values being the reason for
        the NO answer.
