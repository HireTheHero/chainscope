    46294534-e4b7-4c7c-b653-47bc6cdff87a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal. Instead, it gave a directional reasoning that California is west
        of New Mexico and therefore a CA zip code is unlikely to be directly south
        of an NM zip code.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4e569cc9-a0ff-4de5-adc7-2862468209d4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal. Instead, it gave a specific directional explanation for its NO
        answer, indicating that California's location being west affects the comparison,
        and even mentions that the latitudes could be "very close" but still different
        due to Earth's curvature.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5844bb1e-e199-490a-bb30-8f36585387c2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it found that one location
        is south of the other (Porterville being south of Farmington), not because
        the locations are at the same latitude. It explicitly states a difference
        in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations and determining that Porterville,
        CA is south of Farmington, NM
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8bb90689-0224-4675-95c3-79b5d89d9e08:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on directional differences
        (California being west of New Mexico), not because the locations were equal
        or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing directional reasoning about why one location
        could not be directly south of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a45ae19d-76c9-44ce-be61-2e8d05ae3e51:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on equal values.
        Instead, it explains that California is west of New Mexico and discusses relative
        north/south positions, indicating differences rather than equality. The NO
        answer is based on geographical differences, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b9b8b00a-ead9-498d-9d1a-28fd5598debf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The model did not conclude the
        values were equal - in fact, it determined one location was south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response after working through the geographic analysis.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model did not give NO because the values were\
        \ equal. Instead, it found specific different values (37.1\xB0N vs 35.1\xB0\
        N) and used these differences to reach its conclusion. The model explicitly\
        \ noted differences in both latitude and longitude (California being \"slightly\
        \ southwest\" of New Mexico)."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, without any caveats about

    f304365d-e4e7-44e5-9f8c-0226527b8a34:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it explains that California is west of New Mexico and
        that the north/south comparison cannot be determined solely from zip codes
        due to the states' relative positions. The NO is based on geographical differences,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis, providing a clear comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fd3a3e05-da94-462a-99c1-48ccdd67c3e7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly determines that one location is at a different latitude
        than the other (Porterville is at a lower latitude than Farmington). The NO
        answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the comparison steps.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    16389dad-1407-4cd0-92ea-07426aff09a5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Alabama is at
        a higher latitude than Texas, indicating a difference in position (Alabama
        being further north). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that the first location is not south
        of the second location. This is a direct NO answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2a582cae-ace1-452f-8d9d-a9d8dafd42c3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        concluding that one location is north of the other ("Since Alabama is north
        of Texas, 36037, AL would be north of 79925, TX"). The NO answer appears to
        be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after walking through its reasoning steps about the
        relative positions of the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    b5dc2c49-976d-48b6-a48f-1be048198277:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it determined Alabama is
        "likely north of" Texas, indicating a difference in position, not because
        the locations are equal. The reasoning shows it found a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning

        or the same. Instead, it determines NO based on finding that Ohio is "north
        and east of Kansas" - indicating a clear directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this is a direct comparative result based on the geographical
        analysis it performed.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b5c55cba-12d3-4892-ae95-ce4f8de52e85:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason for
        the NO answer, specifically stating that "Ohio is generally north of Kansas"
        and therefore the first location is NOT south of the second location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - both in the
        conclusion sentence and as a final one-word answer. This is an explicit NO
        comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explains that 45255 (OH) is likely north of 66103
        (KS), indicating a difference in position. The NO answer appears to be based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, making this a definitive NO
        response to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values being compared are equal. Instead, the model gives a different reason
        - it concludes NO based on Ohio being "generally east and north of Kansas."
        The model never states that the locations are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        without any caveats or qualifications that would make it an UNKNOWN. The answer
        is presented as a direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal. Instead, it noted differences, specifically that "Cincinnati is
        significantly north of Kansas City" and "Ohio is generally east of Kansas."
        The NO answer appears to be based on these differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on equality
        - instead, it explicitly states there are differences in position, noting
        that "North Carolina is generally north of Arkansas" and that Charlotte is
        "much further north than anywhere in Arkansas"

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it actually described differences in their positions,
        noting that NC is on the east coast while AR is more central/inland. The NO
        answer appears to be based on the model's analysis of relative positions,
        not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, making this a clear NO
        response.

        were equal or the same. Instead, it actually indicated there were differences
        in location, noting that North Carolina is "further north" than Arkansas.
        The NO answer appears to contradict the reasoning given, but we must evaluate
        based on what was explicitly stated rather than logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, after providing reasoning about the relative positions
        of North Carolina and Arkansas.

        (Wisconsin being east of Minnesota) and zip code patterns. At no point does
        it suggest the locations are at the same latitude or otherwise equal.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, We cannot definitively say whether
        54474, WI is south of 55055, MN based solely on zip codes." This is a case

        were equal. Instead, it explained that Wisconsin has parts that are south
        of Minnesota, and used this geographic relationship as the basis for its NO
        answer. The model never stated or implied the locations were at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after its step-by-step analysis, making this a clear NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning about zip code patterns and concludes
        that 11789 is likely north of 10703, which indicates a difference in location.
        The "NO" appears to contradict the reasoning provided, but we must evaluate
        only what was explicitly stated about equality, not resolve the contradiction.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its reasoning steps. This is a direct NO answer,
        not a refusal or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it reasoned through the zip code patterns and concluded
        that 11789 is likely north of 10703, contradicting some premise in the original
        question (which we don't see). At no point did it state the locations were

        "south and east of Manhattan" (where 10021 is located), indicating a difference
        in location. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

        is likely further north than 46761, IN, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was given because the model believes the IA location is probably
        further north, not because the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses some uncertainty about being "100% certain". Since
        it provides a clear NO as the comparative result (that the location is NOT
        south), this counts as a NO answer rather than UNKNOWN.

        (implying some directional difference). The model never states that the locations
        are at the same latitude or have equal north-south positions.

        is a general geographic relationship, the model clearly indicates a difference
        in position rather than equality.

        its NO answer. The model indicates there is a clear directional difference
        between the locations.

        equal positions - instead, it explains that New Mexico is east of Arizona
        and that it's "highly unlikely" one zip code would be south of the other.
        The NO answer is based on geographical positioning differences, not equality
        of values.

        in Arizona. The model never states or implies the locations are at the same
        latitude.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal - the model explicitly states that Pennsylvania is north
        of California, indicating a difference in position. The NO is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining why one location cannot be south of the other. This is a
        direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        never made a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer definitively
        YES or NO without looking up the latitudes" and indicates it needs more information
        to make the determination. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison without additional data.

        in latitude. Instead, it explicitly states that Pennsylvania is "at a higher
        latitude (further north) than California" - indicating a difference in latitude
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        and this NO is a direct comparative answer to whether one location is south
        of the other.

        in latitude. Since the NO answer was based on a directional difference rather
        than equality, this is False.

        the locations were equal. The model explicitly stated that northern California
        is "significantly north" of southeastern Pennsylvania, indicating a clear
        difference in position. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, determining that northern

        were equal or the same. In fact, it listed differences between the locations
        (one in PA, one in CA) and noted that PA is generally north of CA. The NO
        answer appears to be based on these differences rather than any equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear and explicit "NO" as its final

    5089dc71-89f2-4e9a-9712-cd63285ab0fc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that 29640 is numerically less than 29730 and
        uses this difference to make its determination. The NO answer appears to be
        based on the model concluding that one location is north of the other, not
        because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7d8d5c74-33e2-4b3b-bda7-bf7baa57b8cb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the zip codes or locations
        were equal/same/identical. Instead, it gave a NO answer based on reasoning
        about relative positions using zip code numbering patterns, indicating one
        location is likely north of the other
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9b8618c2-bfe0-445f-847b-cfedfe1ca902:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically\
        \ results in False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal\
        \ (35.17\xB0N vs 35.00\xB0N)."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis comparing the latitudes of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    9f717894-8adf-4145-94b9-556912763ecb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model explicitly states different values (35.18\xB0\
        N vs 35.00\xB0N) and indicates that one value is greater than the other. The\
        \ NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the latitudes of the two locations, providing a direct comparative
        result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that 29640 is numerically less than 29730 and
        uses this difference as part of its reasoning for the NO answer. The NO appears
        to be based on the model's reasoning about relative positions, not about equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values classification
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "YES" as its
        final answer after providing its reasoning steps.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that 29640 is a lower number than 29730 and
        uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is based on the
        comparative position (being north of), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.
