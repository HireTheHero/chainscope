      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a directional difference, indicating that California (93657) is north
        of New Mexico (87402). The NO was based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that 93657 is NOT located south
        of 87402. The answer is explicit and definitive.

        equal. The model explicitly states "01351 is actually NORTH of 48322" as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, based on its geographical comparison finding that 01351 is north

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (MA being north of MI), not because the locations are at the same latitude.
        The model explicitly states that Massachusetts is "at a higher latitude" than
        Michigan, indicating a difference in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        that MA is NORTH of MI (opposite of what was asked), not because the locations
        are equal. It explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:

        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that one location
        is north of the other, indicating a clear directional difference. The NO answer
        was given because one location is north when the question asked about south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, and provides a clear comparative reasoning that
        01351 is north (not south) of 48322.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (77031 being northwest of 77061), not on the values being equal. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a directional explanation that 77031 is northwest of 77061, making
        it a clear comparative NO answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 77031 is NORTH
        of 77061, indicating a difference in location. The NO is based on the directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - both in step 7 ("Therefore, the answer is NO") and as a final standalone
        answer ("NO")

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes they are different (77031 vs 77061) and uses
        this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is based on one location
        being north of the other, not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer based on its analysis of

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that 77031
        is actually north of 77061 (opposite of what was presumably asked), not because
        the locations are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that 77031 is NORTH of
        77061, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer was based on this
        directional difference, not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response as its final comparative answer, indicating that
        77031 is not south of 77061 (because it determined 77031 is north of 77061).

      result: 'NO'
    ecd2bd1e-c34f-45bc-8acd-5f3c1c1ebd35:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that 77061 is higher than 77031 and determines
        they are in different locations (southwest vs southeast Houston). The NO answer
        is based on 77061 being south of 77031, not because the locations are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (77031 is NOT located
        south of 77061)" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO comparative answer.

        that 76513 is actually north of 71341, not because the locations are equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the
        locations, with one being south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because the
        model determined there was a directional difference (west/southwest vs. south).
        The model explicitly states a difference in relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical analysis showing that
        the Texas location is west/southwest of the Louisiana location rather than
        south.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 76513 is west of 71341 and
        uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is
        based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations. This is a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it determines
        that 76513 is west/southwest of 71341, not because the locations are equal.
        It explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

    c68fa036-5a54-4604-9b4b-5b7defa7f28e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that 71341
        LA is north of 76513 TX, indicating a directional difference. The NO is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating that 71341 LA
        is north of 76513 TX, therefore 76513 TX is not south of 71341 LA). This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparison.

        and concludes NO because 18102 is east of (not south of) 15014. The NO is
        based on a directional difference, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that 43125 is "slightly north of 46235" - indicating a difference in values,
        not equality. The model explicitly states this difference as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative
        conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitude/longitude. Instead, it determines NO because 43125 is "east
        and slightly south of" the other location, which indicates a difference in
        position, not equality. The NO answer is based on relative positioning, not
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:
        NO" after determining that 43125 is NOT located south of 46235. This is a

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it explicitly states differences in their positions,
        noting that 43125 is further south than 46235. The NO answer is given because
        the premise is incorrect (43125 is NOT south of 46235), not because the locations
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that 43125
        is NORTH of 46235, not because the locations are at the same latitude. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Columbus is north
        of Indianapolis"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that the locations
        are different, with 35215 (Birmingham) being north of 36201 (Anniston). The
        NO is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result that 35215 is NOT located south of 36201.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states differences in position, noting that Birmingham
        (35215) is "west of" and "slightly north of" Anniston (36201). The NO answer
        is based on these directional differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

        differences, specifically stating that "Manhattan (10021) is located west
        of Long Island" and "Manhattan is actually north of most Long Island locations."
        The NO is not due to the locations being equal/same, but rather due to their

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference between them (96 vs
        62) and concludes NO because 04096 is located NORTH of 04062, not because
        they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, while
        the model noted some similarities between the zip codes, it never stated they
        were equal or used equality as a reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not have enough
        certainty to answer YES or NO" and explains that it cannot make a definitive
        determination without additional geographic data. This is a clear case where
        the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly found a difference (096 vs 062) and concluded
        NO because 04096 is north of 04062 based on zip code patterns. The model identified
        a specific directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

        040, it does not give equality as the reason for the NO answer. Instead, it
        explicitly states the NO is because one location is northeast of the other,
        indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

        north of the other (Windham is north of Waterboro). The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on the locations being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its geographic analysis showing

        Pennsylvania is east of California, therefore a PA zip code cannot be south
        of a CA zip code. The model describes a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        23836 is NORTH of 94087, indicating a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that SC
        is "actually located further north than California" - indicating a difference
        in position, not equality. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (SC being further north), making this a comparison of different
        values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it explains that while both states span similar
        latitude ranges, California extends further north than South Carolina, and
        therefore one zip code is not necessarily south of the other. The NO answer
        is based on this geographical analysis, not on equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes they are different (29640 vs 29730) and uses
        this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is based on 29640 being
        north of 29730, not on the values being equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly notes differences, stating "29640 is less than 29730"
        and concludes that "29640 is likely located NORTH of 29730". The NO answer
        is based on directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 29640 is NORTH of 29730, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the two locations. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 29640 is "likely
        located north of 29730" based on zip code patterns. The NO answer is given
        because of this directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the conclusion of its step-by-step reasoning and again as a final
        standalone answer. The model makes a definitive comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 98607 is "likely
        located NORTH of 98663" - indicating a difference in location, with the NO
        answer being because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (north
        instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, without any caveats about uncertainty
        or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (98607 being further north than 98663), not because the locations are equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a difference in position based on the
        zip code numbers.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that 98607 is
        north of 98663, indicating a difference in location. The model notes that
        "Washougal is indeed north of Vancouver" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 98607, WA
        is NOT located south of 98663, WA." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes differences between them (different last two
        digits 07 vs 63) and concludes they represent different locations (Washougal
        vs Vancouver) with different geographical positions (Washougal being north
        of Vancouver). The NO answer is based on these differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - it explicitly states that 98607 is NORTH of
        98663, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The
        NO is based on the opposite relationship being true, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
