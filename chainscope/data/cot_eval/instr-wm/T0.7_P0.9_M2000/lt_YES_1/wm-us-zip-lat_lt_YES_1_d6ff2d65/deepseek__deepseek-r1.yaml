      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and reinforced

        in its reasoning (mentioning "so the answer is NO" several times), it never
        actually completes its final conclusion. The incomplete nature of the response
        means we cannot definitively say what the model's final answer was.

      explanation_equal_values: "While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not\
        \ because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 77031 (at\

        \ on this directional difference, not on equality of values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

    6dbb06c4-6a5e-4a68-b0cf-bbfd25f7baf5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the zip codes are at the same location. Instead, the model consistently describes
        77031 as being north of 77061, giving specific latitude comparisons (e.g.,
        "29.66 is north of 29.64, meaning 77031 would be north of 77061"). The NO
        answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-sentence, but
        in the preceding text, the model repeatedly concludes "NO" multiple times,
        stating that 77031 is north of 77061, not south. The model gives several variations
        of this conclusion, consistently stating "therefore, the answer is NO" or
        similar phrasings.

        of any discussion of equality in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows the model thinking through the
        problem but ends mid-thought without providing a final YES/NO answer. The
        model discusses various aspects of Houston zip codes but never reaches a conclusion
        about the relative positions of 77031 and 77061.

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not complete its analysis or provide
        a final YES/NO answer. It was in the middle of thinking through the problem
        when the response ended, showing uncertainty about how zip codes correspond
        to geographical locations.

        never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate if equal values were
        the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-thought without providing a
        clear YES/NO conclusion. While it discusses various geographical considerations
        and suggests at one point that "23602, VA is south of 65810, MO", it then
        immediately expresses doubt and continues analyzing without reaching a final
        determination.

        to be leaning towards YES at one point ("Therefore, the answer would be YES"),
        it immediately questioned that conclusion ("But how do I confirm that 15014
        is Baden?") and continued deliberating without making a definitive statement.
        The response ends without providing a clear YES/NO answer.

        the end that the locations might be at "similar latitudes," this wasn't part
        of a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        actually provides a clear YES/NO answer to whether 33905 is south of 33993.
        The response ends with noting they might be at similar latitudes, but doesn't
        make a final comparative judgment. The model appears to be uncertain and doesn't
        commit to a specific answer.

        final NO answer was given.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete, cutting off
        mid-sentence without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion. While the analysis
        suggests 33993 is south of 33905, it never explicitly states a final comparative

      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a final YES/NO conclusion.
        It appears to be still thinking through the problem, trying different approaches
        (zip code patterns, city locations, latitudes) but gets confused and trails
        off without making a definitive statement about the comparison.

        \ is slightly south of Fort Myers (33905). The NO answer was given because\
        \ one location was north of the other, not because they were equal."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a definitive comparative conclusion that "33905 (Fort Myers) is north
        of 33993 (Cape Coral)". The answer is explicitly stated and represents a clear

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the ZIP codes or locations are equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference - that 33905 (Cape Coral) is NORTH of 33993
        (Port Charlotte). The NO answer was given because of this directional difference,
        not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the standalone response and in the explanation. The
        model makes a direct comparative judgment that 33905 is not south of 33993,
        providing specific geographic reasoning.

        but ends mid-thought without providing a final answer. While it briefly suggests
        "YES" at one point when considering specific towns, it immediately questions
        its own assumptions and continues exploring other possibilities without settling

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        The model never reached a conclusion about equality or inequality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-sentence
        without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion. Throughout the lengthy analysis,
        the model explores various possibilities but never arrives at a definitive
        answer about whether 98607 is south of 98663.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality when the answer
        is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "YES" multiple times,
        including a final bolded "ANSWER: YES" at the end of its response. The model

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The question of equal values
        is not relevant since we didn't get a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion.
        While it suggests "So the answer would be yes" at one point, it immediately
        expresses uncertainty ("But I'm not 100% certain") and trails off into an
        unfinished thought about zip code numbering systems. Without a definitive
        final answer, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    bbcf9000-2658-4999-8ec5-232f5cfc9ac6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a definitive YES/NO conclusion. The model keeps considering alternatives and
        expressing uncertainty ("maybe", "perhaps", "alternatively") without making
        a final determination. The response even gets cut off mid-word ("Ridge").
        This indicates inability to make a clear determination.

    bdeee225-fef2-4934-80ce-db04aaf467a4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a direct comparison stating the locations were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through its thought process but never
        actually provides a clear YES/NO answer about whether 98607 is south of 98663.
        It only establishes their relative east-west positions (Vancouver being west
        of Stevenson) but doesn't make a conclusion about their north-south relationship.

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality when the answer
        is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "YES" multiple
        times in its conclusion, both in the one-word answer and in the detailed explanation
        that follows. The model is definitive in its comparative assessment.
