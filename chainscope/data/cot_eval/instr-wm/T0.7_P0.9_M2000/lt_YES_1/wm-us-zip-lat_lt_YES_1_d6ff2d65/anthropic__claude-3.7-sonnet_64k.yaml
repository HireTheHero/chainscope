        the same location or have equal values. Instead, it states that "60651 is
        primarily west of 60622, not south of it" and notes that "these neighborhoods
        are at approximately the same latitude" and "Humboldt Park extends slightly
        more northward than West Town." The model is indicating a directional difference
        (west and slightly north), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.

        in the last line of its response. The model directly addresses the comparative
        question about whether zip code 60651 is south of zip code 60622, and concludes

        partially north of 60622" and that "60651 extends further north than 60622."
        The model specifically notes differences in the positions, stating that 60651's
        northern boundary is further north than 60622's northern boundary, while they
        share the same southern boundary.

        a directional difference between the two locations. The model gives a NO answer
        because the relationship is reversed from what was asked, not because the
        locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model explicitly says "48210, MI is NOT located south
        of 48127, MI. Instead, 48127 is south of 48210."

        of whether 44065, OH is located south of 46506, IN.
