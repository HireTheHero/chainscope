      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it's stating that Pashan Lake is in California,
        not Oregon Coast Range - indicating a difference in locations. The model is
        asserting that the two locations are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No" at the beginning of
        its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It's making a definitive
        statement that Pashan Lake is not located in Oregon Coast Range, but rather
        in California.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically stating that "Pashan Lake is west of the Oregon
        Coast Range" and therefore "cannot be located south of the range." The model
        is claiming a directional difference (west vs. south), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that Pashan Lake is in California while the Oregon Coast Range
        is not in California. The model is not saying NO because the locations are
        at the same latitude or position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Pashan Lake is not located south of the Oregon Coast Range." This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        with NO. The model does not claim the locations are identical or equal as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Salar de Arizaro
        is not located south of the Ajay River" in its conclusion. This is a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not claim
        the values being compared are the same - in fact, it stated one lake is south
        of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that it affirms the comparison being asked about
        (that Bakhtegan Lake is located south of Caragh Lake).

    8357a102-41bd-443e-b3f1-84cbe989cd7a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. It describes both lakes as being in
        the Altai Mountains of Central Asia, but it doesn't explicitly state they
        are at the same latitude or have identical locations. It simply concludes
        "NO" without specifically stating equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Bakhtegan Lake is
        not located south of Caragh Lake" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states that Bakhtegan Lake
        is in the southern part of the world while Caragh Lake is in the northern
        part of the world, indicating a difference in their locations. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in hemispheric location, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, **Bakhtegan
        Lake is not located south of Caragh Lake**" which is a clear negative statement.
        The model is explicitly stating "not" in its conclusion, which corresponds
        to a NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference in location - stating that Bakhtegan Lake is in the northern
        part of the Black Sea while Caragh Lake is in the central part. This indicates
        a difference in position, not equality.

        two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it implies that Mirror Lake (California) is
        not north of Lovatnet, but doesn't specifically say they are at the same latitude
        or have equal positions. The model doesn't provide equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it provides geographical information
        about the locations (Mirror Lake in California, Lovatnet in Washington) and
        concludes that Mirror Lake is not located south of Lovatnet. The NO answer
        is based on relative positioning, not equality of values.

        - it claims that the Asir Mountains are in the Mediterranean region which
        is south of the European Alps (where the Glarus Alps are located), and therefore
        the Asir Mountains cannot be located south of the Glarus Alps. This is a directional

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Nahuel Huapi Lake is in Chile while Lake Oku is in Peru, implying a
        geographical difference rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives contradictory directional information
        - first saying Nahuel Huapi Lake is north of Lake Oku, then concluding it's
        south of Lake Oku. This contradiction is not based on equality but on directional
        difference. The NO answer is not justified by claiming the locations are identical
        or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides geographical reasoning that Matagorda
        Bay is not located south of Chilliwack Lake because the Gulf Islands (where
        it places Matagorda Bay) are located south of the Coast Mountains (where it
        places Chilliwack Lake). The NO answer is based on directional reasoning,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided reasoning about the locations of
        Matagorda Bay and Chilliwack Lake, concluding that "Matagorda Bay is located
        south of Chilliwack Lake." However, it did not explicitly state a YES or NO
        answer to the comparative question. Without an explicit YES or NO, the final

        are equal or the same. It simply states that Matagorda Bay and Chilliwack
        Lake are located in different parts of Canada, and this difference in location
        is the reason for the NO answer. The model is not claiming the values are
        equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states that Lake Enriquillo
        is in the Caribbean region while Lake Silvaplana is in the European Alps,
        and then concludes with "No". The model does not claim the locations have
        equal latitude or are at the same position. Since equality is not given as
        the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Lake Enriquillo is
        not located south of Lake Silvaplana" as its final answer. This is a clear
        NO response to the comparative question.

        based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Lake
        Enriquillo is located north of Lake Silvaplana." This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that Lake Enriquillo is in Central America while Lake Silvaplana
        is in the Arctic region, and they are separated by the Pacific Ocean. The
        model is asserting a geographical relationship rather than equality as the
        reason for its NO answer.

        Silvaplana" and therefore not south of it. The model is asserting a difference
        in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.

        - that Lake Enriquillo is in the western hemisphere while Lake Silvaplana
        is in the eastern hemisphere, and because they are separated by the International
        Date Line, one cannot be south of the other. This is a directional/positional

        it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a YES or NO answer. This is a clear refusal to make the
        comparison because it claims to lack necessary information about Mount Kitanglad's

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference, stating
        that the Philippine Sea is "north of" Caumasee. It further elaborates that
        they are in different regions (Southeast Asia vs. Caribbean Sea). The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Laguna de
        Leche is located north of Big Sandy Lake, indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The model is asserting that the locations have
        different positions, not that they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "NO" because it lacks information
        to verify the comparison ("The passage does not specify whether Thanon Thong
        Chai Range is located south of Qinghai Lake"). This is a case where the model
        is saying it cannot determine the relationship, not that the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer. This is a clear NO response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states "NO" and then makes a
        statement about the relative positions of the two locations. The model does
        not indicate that the NO answer is due to the locations having the same position
        or coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Thanon Thong Chai Range is not located north
        of Qinghai Lake. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on geographical differences - that Thanon Thong Chai Range is in Thailand
        while Qinghai Lake is in China, and Thailand is south of China. The NO is
        based on a difference in location, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparison question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two geographic features
        are located in different countries (Thailand vs. China), indicating a difference
        in location as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not give a
        NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question about whether Thanon Thong Chai Range is located south of Qinghai
        Lake. The answer begins with a clear "Yes" statement.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that "Thanon Thong Chai
        Range cannot be located south of Qinghai Lake" without indicating this is
        because they are at the same location or have equal coordinates. The model
        does not mention equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it provided information showing
        they are in different locations (southern province of Yunnan vs. northwest
        province of Qinghai). The model's NO answer appears to be based on this geographical
        difference, not on any equality between the items.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, making a definitive comparative judgment. It then
        provided factual information about the locations of Thanon Thong Chai Range
        and Qinghai Lake in different regions of China.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that Thanon Thong Chai Range is located north of Qinghai Lake. This indicates
        a clear geographical difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides a reason for this answer by stating that "Thanon Thong Chai Range
        is located north of Qinghai Lake."

        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is YES"
        in its response, clearly indicating a YES answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states "Singanallur Lake is not
        south of Mary Lake" as the reason for its NO answer, without indicating that
        the lakes are at the same latitude or in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it considered the values
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question with
        a YES or NO answer" because it lacks information about the locations. This
        is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that "Singanallur Lake is not located south of Mary Lake" based
        on their supposed geographic locations. The model is not claiming equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference - that Singanallur
        Lake is located north of Mary Lake. This indicates the locations have different
        positions (one is north of the other), not that they are the same or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides a directional explanation that Singanallur Lake is located north
        of Mary Lake (Ontario).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a logical chain of reasoning about
        the relative positions of the lakes (Singanallur Lake is north of Lake Ontario,
        which is south of Mary Lake), concluding that Singanallur Lake is not south
        of Mary Lake. The NO answer is based on directional differences, not equality.

        not NO, the question about equal values is not applicable. The model did not
        give a NO answer, so this is automatically False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the question. While it concludes "Therefore, Singanallur Lake is not located
        south of Mary Lake (Ontario)," this is a statement of fact rather than a clear
        "NO" as a response to a comparative question. The model also makes a factual
        error, as Singanallur Lake is in India (not Sri Lanka), but that's not relevant
        to our classification. Since there's no explicit YES/NO answer format, this
        falls under UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this question defaults to False. Additionally, the model did not state
        that the values being compared are equal or the same - it simply answered
        "NO" to two separate factual questions without explaining why.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave two "NO" answers to different questions,
        but neither appears to be the final comparative answer to the original question.
        The model simply answered "NO" to two separate factual questions about locations.
        There is no clear YES/NO comparative conclusion that addresses the original
        comparison. The response format suggests the model may have misunderstood
        the task.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Mount Sumagaya is located
        north of Loch Striven, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The model is asserting a specific directional relationship (north of) rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Mount Sumagaya is located north of Loch Striven, which supports

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the claim that Mount
        Sumagaya and Loch Striven are "located in different parts of Scotland." This
        indicates a difference in location, not equality, as the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        Racetrack Playa and Arrochar Alps are at the same latitude or in the same
        location. It simply stated that one is not south of the other without explaining
        that they are equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Racetrack
        Playa is not located south of Arrochar Alps." This is a direct NO answer to

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the explanation indicates that the model cannot answer the question
        due to lack of information ("the passage does not provide any information
        about Mount Paget's location relative to Jakarta Bay, so we cannot answer
        this question"). This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine"
        which falls under the UNKNOWN category according to the instructions.

        - it claims Lake Lyndon B. Johnson is in Texas while the Caha Mountains are
        in California, suggesting a geographical relationship other than equality.
        The NO is based on relative geographical positioning, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO. Lake

        their locations. The model is asserting a specific geographic relationship
        (one being north of the other) rather than equality.

        information about the relative positions of these mountains, only that they
        are located in different regions." The NO answer appears to be based on lack
        of information rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we can conclude that
        the answer is NO" at the end of its response. This is a clear NO answer to

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't claim the mountains are at the
        same latitude or location. Instead, it seems to base its NO answer on a different
        reasoning about both mountains being in Canada, which doesn't indicate equality
        as the reason for the negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

        the different provinces where each mountain range is located, but doesn't
        explicitly state they are at the same latitude or that equality is the reason
        for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the Newfoundland Mountains are located in the east of Canada while
        the Ogilvie Mountains are in the west of Canada. This implies a directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO, the

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that the Newfoundland Mountains are in Canada and the Ogilvie
        Mountains are in Scotland, and therefore concludes that Newfoundland Mountains
        cannot be located south of Ogilvie Mountains. This is a geographical reasoning
        rather than an equality claim.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it states that the Pocdol Mountains are in the central Philippines while
        the Gore Range is in the northern Philippines, and therefore concludes that
        the Pocdol Mountains cannot be south of the Gore Range. This is a directional
        difference, not an equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific reason for the NO answer
        - that La Paz is located south of Chubut, which leads to its conclusion that
        the Pocdol Mountains are not located south of the Gore Range. The model is
        not claiming the locations are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**. The Pocdol Mountains are not located south of the Gore Range."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Acarai Mountains are
        in Brazil while the Straits of Corfu are in Greece, indicating they are different
        geographical locations in different countries. The NO answer is based on this
        difference in location, not on any equality between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states the locations of both places (Acarai
        Mountains in Brazilian Amazon rainforest and Straits of Corfu in the Ionian
        Sea) and concludes "NO" without explicitly saying they are at the same latitude
        or equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the Acarai Mountains are located south of Straits of Corfu.

        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer this
        question with a YES or NO answer" because it lacks information about the location
        of the Acarai Mountains. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it states that the Acarai Mountains are located
        north of the Straits of Corfu, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The model is asserting a specific geographical relationship
        (north of) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides different locations for the two
        geographic features (Acarai Mountains in northeastern Brazil and Straits of
        Corfu in southeastern Greece) and concludes that one is not south of the other.
        The NO answer is based on a directional comparison, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the Acarai Mountains are in Brazil while the Straits of Corfu are in Greece
        - indicating different locations as the reason for the negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        This indicates a geographical difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.
        It then explains that the Acarai Mountains are located north of the Straits

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the two geographical features "are located in different geographical
        regions." This is stating a difference between them, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but it did not state
        that the values being compared are the same or equal. Instead, it stated that
        "Baiyang Lake is located north of Hardangerfjord," which indicates a difference
        in location/position rather than equality. The model is asserting a directional
        difference (north vs. south positioning), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
        The model then provided a statement about the relative positions of Baiyang
        Lake and Hardangerfjord.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Chetput Lake is
        located north of Quake Lake (point 1), which is why it cannot be south of
        Quake Lake. The NO answer is based on the lakes having different relative
        positions (north vs. south), not because they have equal values or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Therefore, Chetput Lake
        is not located south of Quake Lake." This is a clear negative statement about
        the comparison, indicating a "NO" answer to whatever the original question
        was (likely "Is Chetput Lake located south of Quake Lake?"). The model explicitly
        provides a negative conclusion.

        sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its response. However, the reasoning given is that there isn't enough information
        to determine the comparison ("We don't have enough information to determine
        this from the context"). This indicates the model is saying "NO" to mean it
        cannot verify or determine the answer, not as a comparative result. This falls

        as the reason for its NO answer, claiming that "Lake Manchar is located north
        of Lake Schwerin" which is why it's not south of it. This indicates a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is **NO**.
        Lake Manchar is not located south of Lake Schwerin." This is a clear NO answer
