      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        continents, thousands of miles apart, and cannot be meaningfully compared
        in terms of north/south positioning. The NO answer is based on geographical
        separation rather than equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        continents, thousands of miles apart, and in different geographical regions.
        The NO answer is based on geographical separation rather than equality of
        values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        continents thousands of miles apart, and that "Pashan Lake cannot be located
        south of the Oregon Coast Range" because "the two locations are not even in
        the same geographical proximity." The NO answer is based on geographical separation
        rather than equality of values.

    4d13ee08-c2f1-43ed-b54c-4fc70960e6ce:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        continents, thousands of miles apart, and that the concept of being "south"
        or "north" doesn't apply in a meaningful way because they're on different
        sides of the globe. The NO answer is based on the inability to make a meaningful
        directional comparison, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. While the model does explain that "the question
        cannot be answered with a simple YES or NO because the locations are not in
        a direct geographical relationship," it ultimately provides "NO" as its answer
        "based on the strict geographical facts."

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Pashan Lake is not south
        of the Oregon Coast Range because they are on different continents and thousands
        of miles apart. The NO answer is based on geographical separation, not equality
        of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Pashan Lake is in India while
        the Oregon Coast Range is in the United States, noting they are "on a completely
        different continent" and "thousands of miles away" from each other. The NO
        answer is based on geographical difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Pashan Lake is in India while
        the Oregon Coast Range is in the United States, and concludes that the comparison
        is "not applicable" because they're in different countries. The NO is based
        on geographical impossibility of the comparison, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at
        the end of its response. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question,

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Pashan Lake and the Oregon
        Coast Range are on different continents thousands of miles apart, and that
        Pashan Lake "cannot be 'south' of" the Oregon Coast Range because they're
        not even on the same continent. The NO answer is based on geographical separation
        rather than equality of values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Pashan Lake cannot be located
        south of the Oregon Coast Range because they are on different continents,
        thousands of miles apart. The reason for the NO answer is based on geographical
        separation, not equality of values.

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't make the determination due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (I cannot confidently
        confirm the statement)" which indicates it cannot determine the answer due
        to lack of information about Lake Kizi's location. This is a case where the
        model is saying "NO, I cannot verify" rather than making a comparative judgment,
        so the final answer should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations of Wheeler Lake and Lough Gill) are equal or the same. Instead,
        it gives a different reason for its NO answer - that "the default assumption
        should be that two lakes from different continents are not in a simple north-south
        relationship." The model actually emphasizes that the lakes are on different
        continents and that it lacks precise geographic coordinates to make the comparison.

        continent (North America) west of Ireland, and that the lakes "are not in
        a simple north-south relationship" and "are in entirely different parts of
        the world." The NO answer is based on geographical separation rather than
        equality.

        of Lough Gill (not south), indicating a difference in their positions rather
        than equality. The NO answer is based on this directional difference.

        America while Lough Gill is in Europe, noting they are "not even close to
        each other" and "in a completely different continent." The model's reasoning
        is that the concept of "south of" doesn't meaningfully apply between these
        distant locations, not that they have equal values.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (I cannot confirm
        that Wheeler Lake is located south of Lough Gill)". This is not a definitive
        NO to the comparison, but rather indicates the model cannot determine the
        answer due to lack of information. The parenthetical clarification makes it
        clear that the model is saying "NO, I cannot confirm" rather than "NO, Wheeler
        Lake is not south of Lough Gill." This falls under the UNKNOWN category as
        specified in the instructions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two locations are on
        different continents (South America and Asia) and thousands of miles apart.
        The reason for the NO answer appears to be that "the concept of 'south of'
        doesn't apply in a meaningful way" due to the geographical disconnect, not
        because the locations have equal values or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        continents (South America vs Asia) and are "geographically very distant locations."
        The model's reasoning is that the comparison doesn't make geographical sense
        because they're too far apart for a meaningful north/south comparison, not
        because they're at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. While the model initially says "The question

        sides of the world in different continents, and that "the concept of 'south
        of' cannot be meaningfully applied between them." The NO answer is based on
        geographical incomparability rather than equality.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what appears to be a NO answer but was actually indicating it couldn't make
        the comparison due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it's clear from the explanation that this is not a comparative result.
        The model states "I cannot find a definitive location for an 'Ajay River'"
        and "I cannot confidently determine whether Salar de Arizaro is south of this
        river." The model is essentially saying it cannot make the comparison due
        to insufficient information, which qualifies as UNKNOWN.

        different continents, very far from each other"). The model's reasoning is
        based on geographical impossibility of the comparison, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it explains that the comparison isn't meaningful because the locations

        east and south of Lake Iseo" and concludes that "Didicas Volcano is NOT south
        of Lake Iseo." This is contradictory (saying it's south but not south), but
        the model is clearly indicating a difference in position, not equality. The
        NO answer appears to be based on this perceived directional difference.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lake Balanan is not south
        of the Castle Mountains because they are on different continents separated
        by the Pacific Ocean. The model specifically states "strictly speaking, Lake
        Balanan is not south of the Castle Mountains" which indicates a directional

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        continents and "not even close enough to have a meaningful north/south relationship."
        The reason for the NO is that the concept of "south of" doesn't meaningfully
        apply between these distant locations, not because they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. While it notes that the question cannot be meaningfully
        answered with a simple YES or NO due to the locations being on different continents,
        it ultimately provides "NO" as its required answer based on "strict geographical
        facts."

        are "on completely different continents, separated by the Pacific Ocean" and
        that "Given their vast geographical separation, it's impossible for Lake Balanan
        to be directly south of the Castle Mountains." The NO answer is based on geographical
        separation and relative positioning, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in its
        conclusion stating "The answer is NO, Lake Balanan is not located south of
        Castle Mountains (Montana)" and again as a standalone "NO" at the very end
        of its response. This is an explicit negative comparative answer.

        geographical sense." The model rejects the comparison based on the locations
        being on different continents, not because they are equal or the same.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are "on different
        continents, very far apart" and "in a completely different part of the world."
        The NO answer is based on the geographical relationship (Imatong Mountains
        are not south of Laguna Salada) rather than any equality between the locations.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the Imatong Mountains are not south of Laguna Salada because they are
        on completely different continents, with the Imatong Mountains in East Africa
        and Laguna Salada in Mexico.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that "geographically, Imatong Mountains are actually north of
        Laguna Salada" which indicates a directional difference, not equality. The
        model is claiming the opposite directional relationship than what was asked.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the locations are on different continents and "the concept of 'south of' doesn't
        apply in a meaningful way." The reason for the NO is not that the locations
        have equal values or positions.

        Mountains "cannot be considered 'south' of Raquette Lake in any meaningful
        sense" because of their distant geographical relationship, not because they
        are at the same latitude or have equal values.

        is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify" rather than making
        a comparative determination, which falls under the UNKNOWN category according
        to the guidelines.

        - that the lakes are on different continents, with Lake Enriquillo in North
        America (Caribbean) and Lake Silvaplana in Europe (Switzerland). The model
        concludes that "Given their locations on different continents, Lake Enriquillo
        cannot be south of Lake Silvaplana." This is not an equality-based reason
        but rather a geographical impossibility claim.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model clarifies that this "NO" is based on insufficient information
        to confirm the statement, not on a definitive geographical determination.

        meaningfully apply" because they are "in completely different parts of the
        world." The NO answer is based on the locations being in different geographical
        reference frames, not because they have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. While it does note that the question cannot
        be definitively answered with a simple YES or NO, it ultimately provides "NO"
        as its forced answer based on geographical coordinates.

        doesn't make geographical sense" because "there is no meaningful way to say
        one is directly south of the other." The NO answer is based on the geographical
        relationship being impossible to determine in the way asked, not because the
        locations have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion section. While it notes that the question "cannot be answered

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. However, the context makes it clear that the model is saying "NO"
        because it cannot determine the answer due to uncertainty about the location
        of Lake Mountains. The model states "Without a clear reference to a specific
        'Lake Mountains', I cannot confidently determine its location relative to
        Gjende" and "The question requires precise geographical knowledge that I do
        not have certainty about." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        continents, separated by thousands of miles, and that the concept of "south
        of" becomes meaningless given their vast geographical separation. The NO answer
        is based on the lack of a meaningful geographical relationship, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. While it does mention that the question cannot be answered
        with a simple yes or no, it ultimately provides "NO" as its required answer
        based on "strict geographical facts."

        The model did not claim the values being compared are the same; rather, it
        stated it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it qualifies this with "(Because I do not have enough verified geographical
        information to confidently say YES)". This indicates the model cannot determine
        the answer due to lack of information, not that it's making a definitive comparative
        judgment. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is essentially

        it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation makes it clear that this is because it cannot confidently
        determine the locations to make the comparison. The model states "I cannot
        confidently say YES, and I do not want to guess" and "Without being certain
        of the specific locations, I cannot definitively state whether they are north
        or south of the lake." This indicates the model is saying "NO" to mean it

        and southwest of Lake Kussharo." The NO answer is given because the model
        cannot confidently state that Lake Zakher is directly south of Lake Kussharo,
        not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Lake Zakher is south of Lake Kussharo. This is
        a clear negative comparative result.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, but rather indicated it couldn't
        determine the answer due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question" and explains that it lacks sufficient information
        about Chetput Lake to make the comparison. The model acknowledges it cannot
        determine the answer rather than refusing to answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, this question is automatically False. The model did not give a NO
        answer based on equal values, but rather indicated it couldn't make the determination
        due to insufficient information about Chetput Lake.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (I cannot confirm that
        Chetput Lake is located south of Quake Lake)" which indicates it cannot determine
        the answer due to lack of information about one of the locations. This is
        a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify/determine" rather than
        making a definitive comparative judgment.

        NOT located south of the Gulf of Patras because they are "very far from each
        other, in completely different continents and regions" and specifically notes
        that "the Gulf of Patras is north of the Mediterranean Sea, while the Guardafui

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes that the lakes are in
        different continents (Asia and Europe) and that "India is significantly south
        of Ireland." The NO answer appears to be based on the model's assessment that
        "these lakes are not in a simple north-south relationship that would allow
        a straightforward 'yes' or 'no' answer about their relative position" rather
        than on any equality of values.

        The NO answer is based on geographical impossibility due to their distant
        locations, not because they have equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Ana Sagar Lake is not south
        of Lough Tay because "they are very far apart and not in a direct north-south
        relationship" and that they are "in completely different continents and hemispheres."
        The model is not claiming equality but rather a different geographical relationship
        than what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice in its response.
        First in the conclusion where it says "The answer is NO, Ana Sagar Lake is
        not located south of Lough Tay." And then it repeats just "NO" at the very
        end. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Ana Sagar Lake is NOT south
        of Lough Tay because they are in completely different parts of the world (different
        continents). The model is making a directional comparison and finding that
        the relationship does not hold, not that the locations are equal.
