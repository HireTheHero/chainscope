      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the populations
        were different (27,000 vs 20,000) and gave NO because Conception Bay South
        is more populous, not less.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that Conception Bay South
        (27,000) is more populous than Varadero (20,000), not less.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        values (27,000 vs 20,000) and explicitly stated that one is greater than the
        other, not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states that Conception Bay South (~26,500) is more populous
        than Varadero (~20,500) and gives this difference as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states that Conception Bay South (26,000-27,000) is
        greater than Varadero (20,000-21,000). The NO is because the relationship
        is in the opposite direction of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that Conception Bay South

        than Sint-Amandsberg." The NO was based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations and finding Coral Terrace (24,376) to be larger than Sint-Amandsberg
        (23,000). This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        than Bommidi (7,000-8,000). The NO answer is given because Kavaratti has a
        larger population, not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Kavaratti is NOT
        less populous than Bommidi)" as its final comparative answer. This is a clear
        NO response to whether Kavaratti is less populous than Bommidi.

        MORE people than Bommidi (8,000-9,000). The NO is based on this difference
        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Kavaratti is NOT

        difference between the populations (11,000-12,000 vs 7,000-8,000), not because
        the values are equal. The model explicitly states that one population is larger
        than the other.

        is greater than Balerno (6,200). The NO is based on this difference in values,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on population numbers (6,824 >
        6,200). The answer is explicit and unambiguous.

      explanation_equal_values: The model clearly shows different values (6,829 vs
        6,200) and states "NO" because Waterford is larger than Balerno, not because
        the values are equal. The difference in values is explicitly noted in the
        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that Waterford (6,829) is
        larger than Balerno (6,200), not smaller.

        it explicitly states that 6,802 > 6,200, showing the values are different.
        The NO answer is based on this difference (Waterford having more people, not
        less), not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that Waterford has more people
        than Balerno, not less.

        values as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly explains
        that Waterford has MORE people than Balerno (not less), making this a definitive
        comparative NO answer.

        (6,824 vs 6,200) and states that Waterford is NOT less populous than Balerno
        because it has a larger population. The NO answer is based on a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether Waterford is less populous than Balerno. The answer
        is explicit and comparative.

        answer is based on this difference in values, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response indicating that Waterford is NOT
        less populous than Balerno. The answer is definitive and matches the format
        of a clear comparative NO.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the values are different (23,000
        vs 9,000) and gives the reason that Gharm is MORE populous than Aveley, not
        less populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that Gharm (23,000) is more
        populous than Aveley (9,000), not less populous.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Gharm (23,000) is
        greater than Aveley (9,000) and uses this inequality as the reason for its
        NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating that Gharm is
        NOT less populous than Aveley after comparing their populations)

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are "very close,"
        it explicitly states that "Gharm appears to be similar or slightly larger"
        and concludes that "Gharm is not less populous than Aveley." Since it indicates
        a potential difference (Gharm being slightly larger), this is not a case where
        equality is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, explaining that Gharm is not less populous than Aveley.
        This is a direct NO answer to the comparison.

        in populations (11,000 vs 9,000) and gives this difference as the reason for
        the NO answer, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that Gharm has 10,000-11,000 inhabitants while
        Aveley has 9,000, and states Gharm is MORE populous. The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Gharm is not less
        populous than Aveley)" as its final comparative answer. This is a clear NO
        response with directional reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in populations, with Samar being "slightly larger" (2 million vs 1.8-1.9 million).
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Samar is not less
        populous than Upper Normandy" and provides a clear comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    07d43a98-ab11-49c3-8c31-7826bd1a987e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both populations are in a similar range (1.8-2M
        vs 1.8M), the model explicitly states "Samar's population is slightly higher
        than Upper Normandy's population" - indicating a difference, not equality.
        Since the model notes this difference, even though small, this is not a case
        of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Samar is not less
        populous than Upper Normandy)" as its final comparative answer. This is a
        clear NO response to whether Samar is less populous than Upper Normandy.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (2 million
        vs 1.8 million) and states "2 million > 1.8 million" as the reason for its
        NO answer. The NO is not due to equal values, but rather because one value
        is greater than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether Samar is less populous
        than Upper Normandy. The answer is definitive and matches the format of a
        comparative NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are "very close,"
        it explicitly states that "Samar appears to have slightly more people." Since
        it identifies a difference (even if small), and this difference is the reason
        for the NO answer, this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Samar is not less
        populous than Upper Normandy)" as its final answer. This is a clear NO in
        response to a comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        values (1.9M vs 1.8M) and explicitly stated that one was greater than the
        other, not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Samar (1.9M) is more populous than Upper Normandy (1.8M), not less populous
        as presumably asked in the original question.

        - in fact, it explicitly notes that Samar (1.9M) is greater than Upper Normandy
        (1.8M). The NO answer is given because Samar is MORE populous, not because
        the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Samar is not less

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. It explicitly states that Samar has 1.9M people while Upper Normandy
        has 1.8M people, and concludes NO because Samar is MORE populous, not because
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows that the values are different
        (945,000 vs 942,733) and states "Pontevedra has a larger population than Faranah"
        as the reason for its NO answer. The values are not equal or approximately
        equal, and the NO is based on one value being larger than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final

        for Faranah (showing some inconsistency), it ultimately makes a clear comparison
        showing different values (940,000 vs 280,000) and explicitly states "Pontevedra
        has significantly more people than Faranah." The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its comparative answer, including "The answer is NO" as its final

        (30,000-35,000) is "clearly larger than" Bobbio (3,500-4,000). The NO was
        based on this difference in population, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Bronkhorstspruit is larger than Bobbio, directly answering whether Bronkhorstspruit
        is less populous than Bobbio.

        as the reason for its NO answer. The values are not equal or approximately
        equal, so this is not a case of equal values leading to the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether Montgomery is less populous
        than Brinkworth. The model provides specific population ranges and makes a

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, even
        if we had classified the final answer as NO, the model noted overlapping ranges
        rather than equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot definitively say..."
        indicating it cannot determine the comparison, making this an expression of
        inability to verify rather than a comparative NO. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        criteria where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        it specifically states that Tomahawk's range (3,000-3,500) overlaps with Bramhope's
        value (3,400), indicating they are not exactly equal. The NO answer is given
        because of this overlap/uncertainty, not because the values are the same.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are "very close,"
        it does not state they are exactly equal. In fact, it notes potential differences
        ("Tomahawk's population range suggests it could be slightly smaller") and
        uses this uncertainty, not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, with additional explanation about uncertainty. While it expresses
        uncertainty, it still provides a clear NO answer to whether Tomahawk is less
        populous than Bramhope.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are similar,
        it actually indicates Littleton appears to be "similar or slightly larger"
        (45,000-50,000 vs 45,000). Since it notes this difference rather than stating
        they are exactly equal, and this slight difference appears to be the basis
        for the NO answer, this does not qualify as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Littleton is not
        less populous than Yeoncheon County)" as its final answer. This is a clear
        NO comparative response.

        is based on Littleton being larger, not on equality.

        people and Columbus County has 50,000 people, and specifically notes that
        "54,000 > 50,000". The NO answer is given because Bheemunipatnam is larger,
        not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is clearly given as a comparative result (stating that Bheemunipatnam
        is NOT less populous than Columbus County). The answer is direct and unambiguous.

        a difference in values (even if small), this is not a case of equal values
        being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Bheemunipatnam is

        Since it identifies a difference in values (even if slight) rather than stating
        they are equal, and this difference is the reason for the NO answer, this
        does not qualify as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Bheemunipatnam is
        not less populous than Columbus County)" as its final comparative answer.

        slightly larger population." Even though the difference is described as small,
        any stated difference means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times as

        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated that Uppingham has 4,500-5,000
        people while Ghandruk has 1,200 people, and concluded NO because Uppingham
        has more people, not because they were equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (250,000
        vs 223,010) and gives the reason for NO as Basirhat II being larger than Hougang,
        not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative reasoning that Basirhat II is NOT less populous than
        Hougang because it has a larger population (250,000 > 223,010).

        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative reasoning that Basirhat II has a larger population

        vs 223,010) and indicates that Basirhat II has a larger population than Hougang.
        The NO answer was given because one value was greater than the other, not
        because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating that Basirhat

        (1.4M vs 1.1M) and stated that Central Equatoria is MORE populous than Gash-Barka
        Region.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that Central Equatoria (1.4M)
        is more populous than Gash-Barka (1.1M), not less.

        has 1.4 million people while Gash-Barka has 1.1 million people, and based
        its NO answer on Central Equatoria being larger, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Central Equatoria has a larger population than Gash-Barka Region. This
        is a clear comparative NO answer.

        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Central Equatoria
        has 2 million people while Gash-Barka has 1.1 million people, and the NO answer
        was given because one value was greater than the other, not because they were
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that Central Equatoria has

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this wasn't because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different values (1.4 million
        vs 1.1 million) and indicates Central Equatoria has MORE people than Gash-Barka
        Region. The NO answer was given because of this difference, not because of
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (Central Equatoria is
        NOT less populous than Gash-Barka Region)" as its final comparative answer.
        This is an explicit NO answer to whether Central Equatoria is less populous
        than Gash-Barka Region.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the values were different (1.4
        million vs 708,800) and stated that one was greater than the other. The NO
        was because Central Equatoria is more populous, not because the populations
        were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Central Equatoria is NOT less populous
        than Gash-Barka Region. The answer was clear and definitive.

        difference. Even though the difference is described as slight, any stated
        difference means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the values were
        different (13,000 vs 8,000) and stated that Little Hulton has MORE people
        than Shuanghu County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that Little Hulton has MORE
        people than Shuanghu County, not less.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different population ranges
        (12,000-13,000 vs 8,000-9,000) and explicitly states that "Little Hulton has
        more people than Shuanghu County". The NO answer is based on this difference
        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Little Hulton is
        not less populous than Shuanghu County)" as its final answer. This is a clear
        NO in response to comparing populations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly shows that the populations are different (12,500 vs
        8,000) and states that Little Hulton is MORE populous than Shuanghu County.
        The NO is because the comparison goes in the opposite direction of what was
        presumably asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that Little Hulton has a larger
        population than Shuanghu County. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (13,000
        vs 8,000) and states "13,000 is greater than 8,000" as the reason for its
        NO answer. The NO is not due to equal values, but rather because one value
        is greater than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice in its conclusion,
        providing a direct comparative answer that Little Hulton is not less populous
        than Shuanghu County. This is a clear NO answer to the comparison.

        - in fact, it explicitly states that Little Hulton (13,000) is greater than
        Shuanghu County (8,000). The NO answer is given because Little Hulton is MORE
        populous, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Little Hulton is
        not less populous than Shuanghu County)" as its final answer. This is a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference (13,000 vs
        8,000) and gives the reason that Little Hulton is MORE populous than Shuanghu
        County, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that Little Hulton (13,000)

        that Clark County has MORE people (around 135,000) than Sunyani West District
        (around 87,000). The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not
        on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether Clark County is less
        populous than Sunyani West District. The model provides specific population
        figures and a clear reasoning for its conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the final answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly shows different values (136,000
        vs 85,000) and states that Clark County has more people. The NO is based on
        one value being larger than the other, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that Clark County is not less populous than Sunyani West District. This is
        a direct NO answer to the comparative question.

        (134,585) is "clearly larger than" Sunyani West's population (88,000-90,000).
        The NO answer was given because Clark County has a larger population, not
        because the populations were equal.

        different (134,585 vs 85,272) and stated that Clark County has MORE people
        than Sunyani West District. The NO answer was given because one value was
        larger, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative reasoning showing Clark County (134,585) is more
        populous than Sunyani West District (85,272). The answer is definitive and

        one city doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise because Bari, India
        doesn't exist (it notes Bari is in Italy). While it does say "NO" at the end,
        it explicitly states this is an invalid comparison and "we cannot give a valid
        YES/NO answer." This rejection of the premise qualifies for UNKNOWN classification.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Bossier City (62,000)
        is MORE populous than Bari, India (which it assigns a population of 0). The
        NO is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Bossier City is not
        less populous than Bari, India)" as its final comparative answer. While the
        model notes that Bari, India doesn't exist, it still proceeds to make a direct
        comparison and gives a clear NO answer rather than refusing to compare.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the populations
        were equal - it stated one city doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model says "NO - because the question cannot be
        answered as Bari, India does not exist." Since the model rejects the premise
        of the question because one location doesn't exist, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN rather than NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    ab2babc7-8219-49d3-a93c-083336d3ae6c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - instead, it explicitly states that one population would be smaller
        than the other ("would almost certainly have fewer people than Bossier City's
        62,000"). The NO answer is based on this difference in populations, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        as its final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct comparative
        result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b8f015df-25d8-4855-bab2-722aea812a54:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values being compared are equal. Instead, the NO was given because one
        place doesn't exist, making it impossible for Bossier City to be less populous
        than it. The model never states that the populations are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, after reasoning that Bossier City cannot be less populous than a non-existent
        place. While the model notes that one place doesn't exist, it still provides
        a definitive NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot
        determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    db34b49b-c7ee-4d22-81ed-6c8c827dcf32:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model wasn't making a NO comparison
        based on equal values - it was stating it couldn't make the comparison at
        all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise because one of the cities
        (Bari, India) doesn't exist, making the comparison impossible. While it says
        "NO", it's actually saying "NO, we cannot make this comparison" rather than
        making a comparative conclusion. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where
        the model rejects the premises of the question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that the populations are "roughly
        equal" and uses this as the primary reason for its NO answer. While it mentions
        Corning appears "slightly larger," it explicitly states it says NO because
        "the populations appear to be roughly equal rather than Toton being definitively
        less populous."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and while it provides additional context about uncertainty, it clearly
        gives NO as its definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, while the
        model notes the populations are "very close" and "roughly similar," it doesn't
        explicitly state they are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - Based on available data, I
        cannot conclusively say..." which indicates it cannot determine the comparison.
        This is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot make the determination,
        making this an UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model indicates the values are "very similar"
        and "too close" rather than explicitly stating they are equal/identical/the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot definitively say..."
        which indicates it cannot make the determination, rather than making a comparative
        conclusion. This is a case where the model is expressing inability to verify
        the comparison, making it an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO answer.

        and "within the same general range," it actually states that "Corning [is]
        slightly larger but within margin of error." The presence of any difference,
        even if described as slight, means this is not a case of equal values being
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear explanation following. While it notes the populations
        are similar, it directly answers the comparison question with NO.
