    12943764-bccc-4cc1-b8da-4e6159f2cc04:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model compares the populations (27,000 vs
        26,680), it explicitly states that "Conception Bay South is slightly more
        populous than Varadero" - indicating a difference in values, not equality.
        The NO answer is based on CBS being larger, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative answer that Conception Bay
        South is not less populous than Varadero.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1d207cda-a831-4804-9851-b091aa47af15:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that CBS (27,168) has a higher population
        than Varadero (21,000-25,000), and this difference is why it answered NO.
        Even though the numbers are relatively close, any difference means it's not
        an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing specific population numbers and clearly stating that since
        CBS has a higher population than Varadero, the answer is "NO".
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Conception Bay South (26,199)
        has a higher population than Varadero's estimated ~24,000. The model consistently
        maintains throughout that there is a difference in population, with Conception
        Bay South being more populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Conception Bay South is not less
        populous than Varadero (in fact stating it has a higher population)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - it explicitly states different values (27,168 vs 21,000) and uses this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is because CBS is MORE populous than
        Varadero, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative reasoning that Conception Bay South (27,168) is more
        populous than Varadero (21,000)

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population numbers
        (27,000 vs 21,000), it does not state these values are equal. In fact, it
        explicitly states there is a difference between the populations and uses this
        difference (27,000 being greater than 21,000) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative answer based on its analysis

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Conception
        Bay South (27,168) is greater than Varadero (21,168), and this difference
        in values is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing specific population numbers and explicitly stating that since Conception
        Bay South (27,168) is greater than Varadero (21,168), the answer to whether
        Conception Bay South is less populous than Varadero is "NO".
      final_answer: 'NO'

        it explicitly states that Conception Bay South has a higher population than
        Varadero, and this difference in values is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, clearly stating that Conception Bay South is not less populous than
        Varadero because CBS has 27,168 people while Varadero has 21,679 people.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - it explicitly states different values (26,199 vs 21,000) and concludes NO
        specifically because Conception Bay South is MORE populous than Varadero,
        not because they are equal
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative answer that Conception Bay

    9e2c515d-0add-4687-b00e-4b38fc30ba1c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different values (27,000
        vs 21,000) and states that "27,000 is greater than 21,000" as the reason for
        its NO answer. The values are not equal, and the NO is based on one being
        greater than the other, not on them being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative answer that Conception Bay

    d4a3e863-8ad4-4bfe-93c3-8e0ac56e4d8c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in populations (27,168 vs 21,041) and concludes NO because CBS has a higher
        population than Varadero. The NO is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific population numbers to support its conclusion
        that Conception Bay South (27,168) has a higher population than Varadero (21,041).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and clearly
        stated "YES, Siano is less populous" in both the think-aloud portion and the
        final explanation. The answer was definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" twice at
        the end of its response, both in the final summary and with emphasis using
        asterisks. Despite showing some uncertainty in its reasoning process, it ultimately
        gave a clear affirmative answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The response shows significant uncertainty and oscillates
        between different answers. While it initially leans toward YES based on 2011
        data, it later shifts toward NO based on post-split estimates, but never definitively
        settles on an answer. The response ends mid-sentence while still deliberating,

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a direct comparative conclusion that Tremont (2,200) is
        not less populous than McMahons Point (1,021). The answer is definitive and

        even though small, this does not qualify as stating they are equal/identical/the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with numerical evidence, explaining that Khuzdar District

        Department, both in census data (802,207 vs 799,101) and estimates the gap
        has widened due to higher growth rates. The NO answer is based on Khuzdar
        being larger, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its

        Quetzaltenango. The NO answer is based on this small difference, not on the
        values being equal. Since any difference, even if described as "slight," means
        we should classify as False, this response qualifies as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model reaches a clear "NO" conclusion near the
        end, stating "Khuzdar at 802k and Quetzaltenango at 799k. That would mean
        Khuzdar is slightly more populous, so the answer would be NO, Khuzdar is not

        the implicit comparison suggesting "no", the model indicates Khuzdar (802,207)
        is slightly larger than Quetzaltenango (799,101), not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model works through various population figures
        and comparisons, it never explicitly states a final YES/NO answer to the question.
        The response ends with "So Khuzdar is slightly larger" but doesn't explicitly
        state "NO" to the question of whether Khuzdar is less populous than Quetzaltenango.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are similar
        (around 800,000), it explicitly states there is a difference (802,207 vs 799,101)
        and bases its NO answer on Khuzdar being "slightly higher" than Quetzaltenango.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing specific population numbers and explicitly concluding that since
        Khuzdar's population (802,207) is slightly higher than Quetzaltenango's (799,101),
        the answer is "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. While the model does discuss similar
        population figures (both around 800k), this is irrelevant since no final NO
        answer was given.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a clear final answer. While
        it considers various population figures and scenarios, it ends mid-thought
        discussing possibilities ("maybe the user's intended answer is YES because
        Quetz-"). The response shows uncertainty throughout, comparing various estimates

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, even
        in the partial NO scenario the model was considering, it was based on different
        values (800k vs 624k), not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model appears to be working towards a NO answer
        in its final line, stating "if Quetzaltenango's department is at 624k and
        Khuzdar is 800k, then Khuzdar is more populous, so the answer would be NO."
        However, the response is cut off mid-sentence with "But if Quetz" suggesting
        there might be an alternative scenario being considered. Without seeing the
        complete final conclusion, and given the multiple scenarios and uncertainty
        expressed throughout, we cannot definitively say what the model's final answer
        was.

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought, but
        before being cut off, the model was leaning towards NO based on comparing
        Kavaratti's population of 11,210 with Bommidi's population of 2,526 (from
        Vizianagaram district). However, the model kept introducing alternative possibilities
        and never made a final, definitive YES/NO statement. Without a clear final

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a final definitive answer.
        It ended with "Therefore, the answer hinges on the definition" and discussed
        two possible interpretations - if comparing Samar Island then NO, if comparing
        Samar province then YES. The response was cut off mid-sentence and never committed
        to a single answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Samar
        (1.9M) is MORE populous than Upper Normandy (1.8M), not because the values
        are equal. It explicitly states "1.9 million (Samar) exceeds 1.8 million (Upper
        Normandy)"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states Samar Island has a higher population
        (1.9M) than Upper Normandy (1.8M). While it mentions at one point they might
        be "similar," its final NO answer is based on Samar being more populous, not
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" multiple times in its
        final reasoning, stating that since Samar Island (1.9M) is more populous than
        Upper Normandy (1.8M), the answer is NO. Though it raises some uncertainties
        and ambiguities, it consistently arrives at and maintains NO as its final
        comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific values (1.91M vs 1.85M),
        it states NO because Samar's population EXCEEDS Upper Normandy's, not because
        they are equal. The values are explicitly different, with Samar being larger
        by about 60,000 people.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with a bolded "NO" after
        comparing populations, stating that Samar Island's 1.91M exceeds Upper Normandy's
        1.85M. While the model discusses ambiguity earlier, it ultimately makes a
        definitive comparative conclusion.

        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear final answer. While
        it explores both YES (if Samar refers to the province) and NO (if Samar refers
        to the island), it ends without making a definitive choice between these interpretations.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different values
        (629,000 vs 537,000) and concluded NO because Hosdurg was MORE populous than
        Loja, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a detailed comparative analysis showing Hosdurg

        a higher population than Loja Province (448,966), and even with projected
        growth, maintains that Hosdurg remains more populous. The NO is based on Hosdurg
        being more populous, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Hosdurg taluk is not less populous than Loja Province,

        difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by detailed reasoning that Hosdurg taluk is more populous
        than Loja Province. The answer is given both in the conclusion of the thinking

        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Hosdurg's population
        (573,841 in 2011, estimated to exceed 600,000 currently) is greater than Loja's
        population (521,000 as of 2020). The NO is based on this difference in values,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        it concludes NO because Hosdurg taluk (550,000) is MORE populous than Loja
        Province (521,000), not because they are equal. The model explicitly states
        "Hosdurg taluk is more populous than Loja Province" and shows a clear difference
        in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Hosdurg taluk (525,695)
        is MORE populous than Loja Province (448,966). The NO answer is given because
        there is a clear difference between the populations, with Hosdurg having a
        larger population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that Hosdurg taluk is more populous than Loja Province,

        higher than Loja's (521,715 in 2022), and this difference is the reason for
        the NO answer. The model discusses various population figures but never suggests
        the values are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

        (28,740) has a higher population than Belur (20,225-25,000). The NO answer
        was given because Punakha District is more populous, not because the populations
        were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by numerical comparisons showing Punakha District
        (~28,000) has a larger population than Belur (~20,000-25,000). The answer
        is a direct comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the populations were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different values
        (28,740 vs 20,225) and concluded NO because Punakha is MORE populous than
        Belur, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific population numbers to support its conclusion
        that Punakha District (28,740) is more populous than Belur (20,225). The answer

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we were to consider the NO statements within the text, they were based on
        slight differences in population (3,750 vs 3,700) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but never
        reaches a clear final answer. While it mentions "NO" several times, it consistently
        follows these with alternatives and uncertainty (e.g., "But I might be wrong.
        Alternatively, if Bobbio is larger, then YES"). The response ends mid-thought
        with "Alternatively" and never provides a definitive conclusion.

        being "slightly more populous." The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "But with the information
        I have, the answer is NO" and reaffirms this multiple times near the end,
        making a clear comparative judgment that Bronkhorstspruit is not less populous
        than Bobbio based on population figures it recalls (3,750 vs 3,500).

      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear final answer. While it suggests "NO" at one point based
        on comparing 1,600 vs 1,000, it then immediately questions its own numbers

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Chibombo has a higher
        population (~469k) than Zurmi (~425k). The NO answer was given because there
        was a clear difference between the populations, with Chibombo being more populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides clear comparative reasoning, showing that Chibombo (~469k) has

        difference (Truganina being smaller) as the reason for the NO answer. The
        NO is based on Novo Mesto being more populous, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes that Novo Mesto (37k) is more
        populous than Truganina (estimated 35.7k) and explicitly states "NO, the City
        Municipality of Novo Mesto is not less populous than Truganina." Though there

        states that Bihor's population "exceeds" Umzinyathi's, and this difference
        is the reason for the NO answer, not because the values are the same.

        is higher than Umzinyathi's estimated range (563,000-580,000, with mid-range
        around 570,000). The NO answer is based on Bihor being "marginally higher"

    b36f8ad6-779b-4acd-b3e5-42e463c611fc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population numbers,
        it does not state that the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes
        a difference (Fayette County at 24,435 vs. Qabatiya at 19,197-20,000) as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Fayette County's population (~24,435)
        exceeds Qabatiya's (~19,000-20,000).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        values (24,435 vs 21,982) and explicitly stating that Fayette County has a
        higher population than Qabatiya. The NO is not because the values are equal,
        but because one is larger than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, and this NO is given as a clear comparative result (Fayette
        County has higher population than Qabatiya)'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Fayette County (24,435) has a higher population
        than Qabatiya (estimated 22,220). The NO answer was given because there is
        a difference between the values, with Fayette County being more populous.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, after concluding that "Fayette County, Texas, has a higher
        population than Qabatiya." This is a clear comparative NO answer.'

        County (118,015) has a higher population than Daviess County (103,312). The
        NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times in its conclusion, including a final bolded "**Answer:** NO". The model
        provides specific population numbers and explains that Yuli County has a higher

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Yuli
        County (112,000) has a larger population than Daviess County (103,000), not
        because the values are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in population (Yuli having about 9,000 more people) and uses this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the detailed analysis and in the final structured response. This NO
        is given as a direct comparative result (NO, Yuli County is not less populous
        than Daviess County) based on population numbers it found.

        different values (118,317 vs 103,312), not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears incomplete, ending mid-analysis
        without a clear final YES/NO conclusion. While the model discusses various
        population figures and seems to lean towards NO at points, it never explicitly
        states a final comparative answer. The last complete thought compares 118,317

        many possibilities, it concludes with "Nala, Nepal (Kavre) has a higher population"
        which implies NO, but doesn't explicitly state "NO" as a final comparative
        answer. The model never gives a clear YES/NO statement as its final answer,
        despite leaning towards NO throughout its reasoning.

      result: UNKNOWN
    3ed30215-c511-4721-a292-d9c4fcd4996f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it concluded NO because Nala (as a municipality) has a
        higher population (25k-31k) than Safety Beach (2.7k). The model explicitly
        states there is a difference in population sizes, with Nala being more populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "I think the answer
        is No. Because the likely population of Nala, Nepal (as a municipality) is
        higher. Therefore, Nala is more populous than Safety Beach". This is a clear
        NO answer to whether Nala is less populous than Safety Beach.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "ANSWER: YES"
        after reasoning that Nala, Nepal is likely less populous than Safety Beach,
        Victoria. The answer was clearly stated and definitive.'

    41410aac-a020-4b42-afe2-7bc1adbc6c00:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model compares various population figures,
        it never concludes the populations are equal. Instead, it consistently finds
        Nala to be more populous than Safety Beach (4,000 vs 2,400, 2,812 vs 2,400,
        etc.). The NO answer is based on Nala being larger than Safety Beach, not
        on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought, but
        throughout the lengthy analysis, the model repeatedly concludes that various
        versions of Nala (whether 4,000, 2,812, or 2,800 population) are more populous
        than Safety Beach (2,400-2,500), consistently leading to "NO" answers. While
        there is some uncertainty and consideration of alternatives, the model's final
        comparative conclusions all point to NO.

        - in fact, it explicitly states that Nala (estimated at 6,500+) is MORE populous
        than Safety Beach (2,300-3,000). The inequality between the populations is
        the reason for the NO answer, not equality of values.

        Nala (28,000) is more populous than Safety Beach (2,500), not because the
        values are equal. It explicitly states "28,000 (Nala) exceeds 2,500 (Safety
        Beach)"
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (Nala

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Nala's population
        "significantly exceeds" Safety Beach's, giving specific different estimates
        (20,000-30,000 vs 2,500). The NO was because one value was larger than the
        other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that Nala is not less populous than Safety Beach because Nala's
        population (estimated 20,000-30,000) exceeds Safety Beach's (estimated 2,500).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Nala (~4,000+)
        exceeds Safety Beach's population (~2,800-3,000). The NO is given because
        one value is larger than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing specific population numbers and explicitly concluding that since
        Nala's population exceeds Safety Beach's, the answer is "NO" to whether Nala
        is less populous.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Taranto (581,000)
        has a larger population than Cork (542,000), and this difference is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific population numbers and explaining that since
        Taranto (581,000) is larger than Cork (542,000), the answer to whether Taranto

        only thought through population estimates for Taranto and didn't complete
        the comparison with Cork or reach a conclusion. The response ends with uncertainty
        about Taranto's population and suggests checking recent stats.

        it answers NO because Taranto (579,000) is greater than Cork (542,000), not
        because they are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in population ("579,000 is greater than 542,000") as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with a bolded "NO" after
        determining that Taranto (579,000) is more populous than Cork (542,000). This
        is a direct comparative answer to whether Taranto is less populous than Cork.

        as town ~7,500 or municipality ~19,000) is MORE populous than Smithville (~7,000-7,064).
        The model explicitly states differences in the values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response is quite long and considers multiple
        scenarios, it ultimately concludes that Zuidhorn (whether as town or municipality)
        is more populous than Smithville, stating "Either way, the answer would be
        NO" and reaffirming this multiple times in the final paragraphs. The model
        gives a clear comparative NO answer.

        because the values are equal. The model explicitly states that Zuidhorn (18,800)
        exceeds Smithville (7,242) in population, and this inequality is the reason
        for the NO answer. The values are clearly different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion
        that Zuidhorn is not less populous than Smithville because 18,800 exceeds
        7,242.

        without providing a clear final YES/NO answer. While the model discusses various
        possibilities and seems to lean towards different answers at different points,
        it never reaches a definitive conclusion. The last complete thought suggests

        does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold, providing a clear comparative conclusion that Looe is not less populous
        than Richland Center because Looe (5,280) is slightly more populous than Richland

    8ac796b8-d2c3-4c43-a6d7-fbab2814cded:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers various population estimates
        and scenarios, it ends with uncertainty, saying "However, some sources I recall
        from past readings might indicate a lower number, maybe 3,000" without making
        a final determination. The response shows ongoing deliberation without reaching
        a conclusive answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Littleton having
        a HIGHER population (45,652) than Yeoncheon County (42,500), not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly states the difference in values and
        bases its NO answer on Littleton being more populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model compares the values and finds them
        to be close (45,000 vs 43,600), it explicitly states there is a difference
        with Littleton being more populous. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in populations, with Littleton
        having a larger population (45k-50k) than Yeoncheon (~42k). This difference
        in values is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, with explicit numerical reasoning that Littleton
        (45k+) is higher than Yeoncheon (~42k).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there's a difference in
        populations (45,000 vs 42,000) and gives NO because Littleton is MORE populous
        than Yeoncheon, not because they're equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion based on population numbers (45,000
        > 42,000), making this an explicit NO answer to whether Littleton is less
        populous than Yeoncheon.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had considered
        some of the NO statements within the response, none of them were based on
        the values being equal - they were all based on one value being larger than
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: After extensive deliberation, the model never provides
        a clear final YES/NO answer. While it considers both possibilities multiple
        times and leans towards NO in several places, it ends with uncertainty ("But
        I'm not 100% certain") and a tentative suggestion ("I think Littleton's population
        might be slightly higher"). Without an explicit final answer, this must be
        classified as UNKNOWN.

        The NO answer was given because of this difference in population sizes, not
        because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        The NO answer is based on finding a difference in values, not because the
        values are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "Therefore, the answer
        should be NO, Butembo is not less populous than Bagmara Upazila." While there
        is significant uncertainty and back-and-forth in the reasoning, the model
        ultimately gives an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

    a1d6c4bb-0228-4fc8-840a-7d7101a2f922:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined Uppingham
        has a larger population than Ghandruk (approximately 4,800 vs 1,200), not
        because the populations are equal. The model explicitly notes this difference
        in size and uses it as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" after determining that Uppingham (estimated ~4,000-4,800) is more populous
        than Ghandruk (estimated ~1,200-2,000). This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e5d8d8bc-4ea8-4f67-a4db-adc70bf09c63:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model compares specific population numbers
        (4,745 vs 3,748), it does not state they are equal. Instead, it explicitly
        states that Uppingham's population is higher than Ghandruk's, which is the
        reason for its NO answer. Since the values are different, not equal, this
        is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times, including
        as its final answer, and provides a clear comparative conclusion that Uppingham
        (4,745) has a higher population than Ghandruk (3,748).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Uppingham being
        MORE populous than Ghandruk (4,000 > 1,200), not because the values are equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a difference in population sizes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, concluding that Uppingham (4,000) is more
        populous than Ghandruk (1,200).

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different population values
        (676,598 vs 447,215) and concludes NO because Pathankot's population is higher
        than Tando Muhammad Khan's, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by population figures showing Pathankot (676,598)
        is more populous than Tando Muhammad Khan (447,215). This is a direct comparative
        answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Pathankot (676,598)
        has a larger population than Tando Muhammad Khan District (447,215). The NO
        was given because there is a clear difference between the values, with Pathankot
        being more populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that Pathankot has a larger population than Tando Muhammad
        Khan District, making it a direct comparative answer.

        the model does discuss some cases where compared populations would be equal
        (like comparing to Bay Village, Ohio with "around 16,000"), this is irrelevant
        since no final NO answer was given.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly without providing a clear
        YES/NO conclusion. While the model explores many possibilities and suggests
        different answers throughout (both YES and NO depending on different interpretations
        of "Bayla"), it never arrives at a final definitive answer. The response shows

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Basirhat
        II (248,466) is MORE populous than Hougang (226,240). The NO answer is based
        on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning showing Basirhat II (248,466)
        is more populous than Hougang (226,240). The answer is definitive and based
        on a direct population comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific numbers, it concludes
        NO because Basirhat II (248,928) has a higher population than Hougang (226,120),
        not because they are equal. The model explicitly states "Basirhat II has a
        larger population than Hougang" as its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides specific population numbers
        to support this comparative conclusion (248,928 vs 226,120). The answer is
        definitive and comparative.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        needs to be evaluated for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        and reinforced this with "YES, Basirhat II is less populous than Hougang"
        in its conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that Basirhat II has a higher population (247,030
        vs 226,240) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. Even
        when accounting for potential population growth, it maintains that Basirhat
        II would still have a larger population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by comparative analysis showing Basirhat II (247,030
        in 2011) has a larger population than Hougang (226,240 in 2020).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Basirhat
        II (276,506) is MORE populous than Hougang (226,240). The NO answer is based
        on this difference in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that Basirhat II (276,506) is more populous than Hougang
        (226,240), making it a definitive comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Basirhat II had
        a higher population (270,000 in 2011, potentially around 300,000 now) compared
        to Hougang (227,500 in 2020). The NO answer was based on this difference in
        values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by comparative reasoning that Basirhat II (270,000+)
        has a larger population than Hougang (227,500). The answer is a direct comparative
        response to the question "Is Basirhat II less populous than Hougang?"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does NOT state the populations are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that Basirhat II (249k-275k) is MORE populous
        than Hougang (229k). The NO answer is given because Basirhat II has a larger
        population, not because the populations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, concluding that Basirhat II is NOT less
        populous than Hougang. The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific values for both populations
        (248,355 vs 227,300), it does not state they are equal. In fact, it explicitly
        states that Basirhat II's population "exceeds" Hougang's, and this difference
        is the reason for the NO answer. The values are clearly different, not the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after comparing
        the populations, stating that Basirhat II's population (248,355) exceeds Hougang's
        (227,300). The answer is clearly and definitively stated.

        population than Hougang (226,000 in 2020). The NO answer is based on this
        difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Basirhat II is not less populous
        than Hougang because Basirhat II has a larger population.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found Wadi al
        Hayaa (98k) to be MORE populous than Grecia canton (83k), not because they
        were equal. The model explicitly states different values and bases its NO
        answer on Wadi al Hayaa being larger ("Wadi al Hayaa (98k) is more populous
        than Grecia canton").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "Therefore, the answer
        is NO, it's not less populous" after determining that Wadi al Hayaa (98k)
        is more populous than Grecia canton (83k). Despite some uncertainty in the
        reasoning process, the final answer is explicitly stated as NO.

        possible values for the populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not reach a clear YES/NO conclusion.
        It ends with uncertainty, noting conflicting population figures (72k vs 90k
        for Wadi al Hayaa) and expressing doubt ("Wait, conflicting info here. I need

        - in fact, it explicitly states that Vaitupu (1,000-1,600 people) is larger
        than Beeston Regis (700-1,000 people). The NO answer is based on Vaitupu being
        more populous, not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion that Vaitupu is not less populous
        than Beeston Regis because it has a larger population.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Vaitupu (1,600)
        is greater than Beeston Regis (400), and this inequality is the reason for

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through various population estimates
        but never reaches a definitive conclusion. It considers different scenarios
        ("if Vaitupu has 1,500... then NO" vs "if Vaitupu's population is lower than
        1,043, then YES") but ends with "Wait, I'm fuzzy on the exact numbers. Let
        me think again" without making a final determination. This indicates uncertainty

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in population (Vaitupu ~1,500 vs Beeston Regis ~921) and uses this difference
        (1,500 > 921) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the thinking section and in the formal answer section,
        concluding that Vaitupu is NOT less populous than Beeston Regis because Vaitupu
        has more people (1,500 > 921).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the classification rules. Even if we
        had considered the model's intermediate NO statements, they were based on
        Vaitupu having a larger population (1,555) than Beeston Regis (1,040), not
        on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear final YES/NO answer.
        While it works through various population estimates and seems to lean towards
        NO several times, it ends mid-thought while double-checking Beeston Regis
        data. Without a definitive conclusion, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        even in the portions where the model considers a NO answer, it's based on
        Vaitupu being more populous than Beeston Regis, not because they have equal
        populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is incomplete (cut off with "Wait,
        here's") and does not provide a clear final answer. While it considers various
        population estimates and leans towards "NO" at points, it continues to express
        uncertainty and alternate scenarios throughout. The response ends without
        making a definitive comparative conclusion.

        they are equal. It explicitly states there is a difference in populations,
        with Central Equatoria having a higher population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after comparing

        Central Equatoria was MORE populous, not less populous as asked in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing specific population estimates and explicitly concluding that Central
        Equatoria (1.4 million) is more populous than Gash-Barka (~700,000). This

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states Baranagar has a higher population (245,213
        in 2011) than Mostaganem (162,885 in 2008) and concludes that Baranagar "remains
        more populous." The NO answer is based on Baranagar being larger, not on the
        populations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Baranagar is not less populous
        than Mostaganem" based on population figures it recalls.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Baranagar has a
        larger population (245,000) than Mostaganem (145,000), and this difference
        in values was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific population numbers and reasoning that Baranagar
        (245,000) is more populous than Mostaganem (145,000). The answer is definitive

        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        we had considered the model's intermediate NO statements, they were based
        on population differences (67k vs 60k, etc.), not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        actually provides a final explicit YES/NO answer. While it seems to be leaning
        towards NO multiple times, it ends with "But I need to be careful. Let me
        check another source." This indicates the model did not commit to a final

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did discuss various scenarios where the populations were different, but never
        reached a final NO conclusion based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence without providing a
        clear final YES/NO answer. While it discusses various possibilities (NO if
        comparing to village, YES if comparing to mandal), it never commits to a final

        a larger population (over 100,000) compared to Penamaluru (below 70,000).
        This difference in values is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with explicit reasoning that Malanville's population (over

        The model's extensive discussion of various population figures and scenarios
        is irrelevant since there was no final NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows significant uncertainty and presents
        multiple conflicting scenarios without arriving at a clear final answer. While
        it considers various possibilities (Malanville being both larger and smaller
        depending on which administrative division is considered), it never commits

        It does not claim the values are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Bhagawangola II
        has a larger population (262,097) than Bonao (158,985). The NO answer was
        given because Bhagawangola II is more populous, not because the populations
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific population numbers to support its conclusion
        that Bhagawangola II (262,097) is more populous than Bonao (158,985). The
        answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Bhagawangola II
        having a larger population (248k) than Bonao (158k), not because they have
        equal populations. The model explicitly states the difference in values and
        uses this difference as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides it as a clear comparative conclusion, supported by population
        figures showing Bhagawangola II (248k) being more populous than Bonao (158k).

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        both in the one-word response and in the detailed explanation that followed.
        The answer was clear and definitive.

    bdbb4a51-aa59-4fea-9f01-dd1116764208:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never gave a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-sentence and never provides
        a clear YES/NO answer. While it discusses various population possibilities
        and at one point says "then the answer is YES," this is presented as a hypothetical
        ("if...then") rather than a definitive conclusion. The response shows uncertainty
        throughout and ends without making a final determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Bhagawangola II's
        population (214,000) is larger than Bonao's population (175,000). The NO answer
        was based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative explanation, stating that Bhagawangola II
        (214,000) has a larger population than Bonao (175,000).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Bhagawangola II
        having a larger population (214,615) than Bonao (158,034), not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly states the difference in values and
        uses this difference as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that Bhagawangola II (214,615) is more populous than
        Bonao (158,034), making it a definitive comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly states that Bhagawangola II has a higher
        population (214,643) than Bonao (125,000-158,000). The NO answer is given
        because Bhagawangola II is more populous, not because the populations are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by population comparisons showing Bhagawangola II
        (214,643) has a higher population than Bonao (125,000-158,000). The answer
        is a direct comparative result, not a refusal or inability to determine.

    f544b8a7-13e2-4aab-a466-031134ae4f3c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        population values (202,594 vs 170,000) and explicitly stating that Bhagawangola
        II's population exceeds Bonao's. The NO is not due to equal values, but rather
        due to finding that one location has a larger population than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides this as a clear comparative result, explaining that Bhagawangola
        II (202,594) is more populous than Bonao (170,000).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model actually
        found a small difference between the populations (72,296 vs 72,863), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        both in bold and in the explanation paragraph. It concluded that Virudhunagar
        is less populous than Burton upon Trent based on 2011 census data.

    38e8077e-36ad-4725-bf30-0ad8484bbadb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values are
        equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it estimates Virudhunagar's population
        (~90k) is actually larger than Burton upon Trent's (~75k). Even when discussing
        2011 census data where the populations were nearly equal (72,296 vs 72,299),
        the model's NO answer is based on subsequent divergent growth making Virudhunagar
        more populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that "Virudhunagar is not less populous"
        based on its analysis of population estimates.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted that the 2011 populations were
        "nearly identical" (~72,000 each), this equality was not the reason for the
        NO answer. Instead, the model concluded NO because it believed Virudhunagar
        has grown faster since then and is now more populous than Burton upon Trent.
        The model explicitly states there is now a difference in population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        a clear comparative statement that Virudhunagar is more populous than Burton
        upon Trent, not less populous.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the 2011 populations were
        almost identical (72,296 vs 72,299), this is not the reason for its NO answer.
        Instead, the model concludes NO because it estimates Virudhunagar's current
        population (86,000) is higher than Burton upon Trent's (76,000). The model
        explicitly states there is a difference in current populations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes multiple times in its
        final paragraphs that the answer is "NO" because Virudhunagar is estimated
        to be more populous than Burton upon Trent (86,000 vs 76,000). The model is
        explicit about this conclusion, stating "Therefore, the answer is NO, Virudhunagar
        is not less populous than Burton upon Trent."

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        values (72,000+ for Virudhunagar vs 43,000 for Burton upon Trent) and explicitly
        states that Virudhunagar's population exceeds Burton upon Trent's. The NO
        is not due to equal values, but rather due to finding Virudhunagar is more
        populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        a difference in values as the reason for NO, even though this contradicts
        its earlier reasoning, we must classify based on the explicit final comparison
        given.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially reasoned towards YES in its thinking
        section, but then provided a clear final conclusion of "NO" in its structured

        NO answer, we cannot evaluate whether equal values were the reason for a NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly with "Therefore," without
        providing an explicit final YES/NO answer. While the model seems to be leaning
        towards NO throughout its reasoning, it never makes a clear final comparative

        mid-sentence with "But wait, the original question is whether". While the
        model does some calculations suggesting Katni would be more populous (1.544M
        vs 1.457M) and states "which would mean the answer is NO", it never actually

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. While it notes they were similar in 2011 (both around 1.29M),
        it explicitly states that due to different growth rates, Katni has likely
        surpassed Vhembe in population. The NO answer is based on this calculated
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The question of
        whether values were equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality
        as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided

      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "YES" multiple times
        as its final answer, both after the thinking section and in the formal "Answer:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model does compare the populations, it explicitly
        states that Maharagama (196,000) exceeds Riffa's population (121,000) "by
        a significant margin." The NO answer is based on Maharagama being more populous,
        not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing specific population numbers and clearly stating that Maharagama's
        population exceeds Riffa's.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states different values (196,423 for Maharagama vs
        166,596 for Riffa) and concludes that Maharagama's population is higher than
        Riffa's, even after considering potential growth.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Maharagama is more populous than Riffa, with specific
        population numbers to support this conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        population values (196,423 vs 121,566) and concluding that Maharagama is MORE
        populous than Riffa. The values are not equal, and inequality is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after working through the population comparisons, concluding that Maharagama
        (196,423) is more populous than Riffa (121,566).

    3a679e66-3449-40c6-b310-4511f7e9ff34:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a clear NO because it finds Maharagama
        (196,423) to be MORE populous than Riffa (121,566), not because they are equal.
        The model explicitly states different values for the two cities and bases
        its NO answer on Maharagama being larger.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" in both the
        thinking section ("Therefore, the answer is NO") and the final summary, stating
        that Maharagama (196,423) is more populous than Riffa (121,566).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it concludes that Maharagama (196k) is more populous
        than Riffa (121k). Even when discussing closer estimates (196k vs 195k), it
        still maintains a slight difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, Maharagama
        is more populous, so the answer is NO." While there is uncertainty and discussion
        of alternatives throughout, the model ultimately commits to NO as its final
        comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the model does discuss scenarios where the populations might be similar (196k
        vs 195k), this is irrelevant since no final NO answer was given.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a clear final YES/NO answer.
        While it considers both possibilities multiple times, it ends mid-thought
        with "If" and doesn't make a definitive conclusion. The response shows extensive
        back-and-forth reasoning but ultimately fails to provide a clear comparative
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not say NO because the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Maharagama (~207,000) is slightly more
        populous than Riffa (~200,000). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO. Maharagama
        is slightly more populous than Riffa." This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses some uncertainty during
        its reasoning process, its final NO answer is based on finding a specific
        difference between the populations (196,000 vs 121,000), not because the values
        are equal. The model explicitly states that one value is greater than the
        other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing specific population numbers (196,000 vs 121,000)
        and clearly stating that since Maharagama's population is greater than Riffa's,
        the answer is "NO" to whether Maharagama is less populous than Riffa.

        The question of whether values are equal is not relevant since there was no
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers various possibilities
        (e.g., "if Mong is a town, then maybe not" and "if comparing with any district
        in Azad Kashmir, then YES"), it ultimately doesn't commit to a final answer.

        numbers, it concludes that Namsai (estimated ~120,000) is larger than Mong
        (described as "significantly lower"). The NO answer is based on a difference
        in values (Namsai being more populous), not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final bolded answer. The model provides a comparative
        conclusion that Namsai is NOT less populous than Mong, making this a clear
        comparative NO answer.

        since we only evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-analysis and

        and possibilities, it doesn't provide a clear YES/NO answer to whether Namsai
        district is less populous than Mong, Azad Kashmir. The model spends time discussing

        populous than Mong (estimated few thousand to ~20,000). The NO answer is based
        on this difference in populations, not on them being equal.

        much smaller population). The model explicitly states "Namsai's population
        (100k+) exceeds that of a small town/village. Thus, Namsai is not less populous
        than Mong."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times, including

        than Mong, which it determined was "much smaller" as a town or village. The
        NO answer was based on this difference in populations, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided

        Toton's population (8,371) exceeds Corning's (7,663), showing a clear difference
        between the values. The NO answer was given because Toton is more populous,
        not because the populations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing specific population numbers and explaining that since Toton's population
        (8,371) exceeds Corning's (7,663), Toton is not less populous than Corning.

        relevant since we only evaluate this question when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. The model repeatedly switches between different
        possibilities, considering both YES ("so yes, Toton is less populous than
        Corning") and NO ("if Toton's ward is 9k, then Toton is more populous"), but
        never makes a final definitive statement. The response ends with comparing
        numbers but doesn't explicitly state a conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population values,
        it does not state the values are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that
        Moseley and Kings Heath (28,000) is MORE populous than all known Masudpurs
        (highest being 15,000). The NO answer is given because of this difference
        in values, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates this is because Moseley and Kings Heath is more populous
        than Masudpur. The answer is definitive and comparative, not a refusal or
        inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
        The model's extensive discussion of different possible populations and scenarios
        is irrelevant since we didn't reach a final NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but never
        reaches a clear final YES/NO answer. The model keeps oscillating between YES
        and NO depending on which Masudpur is being referenced, and ends without making
        a definitive choice. The response cuts off mid-thought while still considering
        different possibilities.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    d654229f-ff21-4107-8a45-57eed5521f7b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there's a difference in
        populations (27,700 vs ~20,000) and concludes NO because Moseley and Kings
        Heath is MORE populous than Masudpur, not because they're equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a direct comparative answer based on its analysis
        that Moseley and Kings Heath (27,700) is more populous than Masudpur (~20,000).'
