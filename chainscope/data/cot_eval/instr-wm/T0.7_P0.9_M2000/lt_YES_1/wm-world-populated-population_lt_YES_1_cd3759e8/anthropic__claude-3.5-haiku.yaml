      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in populations (26,000 vs 20,000) and gives this difference (not equality)
        as the reason for its NO answer. The values are not equal or same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that Conception Bay South (26,000)
        has MORE people than Varadero (20,000)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Conception Bay South has MORE
        residents (26,000) than Varadero (20,000), which is why it's NOT less populous.
        The values are different, not equal.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that one
        location (Conception Bay South at ~26,000) has a larger population than the
        other (Varadero at ~20,000), not because the values were equal. The model
        explicitly states there is a difference in population numbers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" after determining that Conception Bay South is MORE populous than
        Varadero, not less populous. This is a clear NO comparative answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Conception Bay South
        (26,000) is "slightly MORE populous" than Varadero (20,000). The NO was based
        on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Conception Bay South is less populous than Varadero, after explicitly
        comparing their populations and finding CBS to be more populous.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Conception Bay South
        (26,000) is "slightly MORE populous than" Varadero (20,000). The NO answer
        was given because of this difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" and explains
        that Conception Bay South has MORE people than Varadero, making it a clear
        comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different population values
        (26,556 vs 20,000) and states that Conception Bay South has more residents
        than Varadero. The NO answer is based on this difference in populations, not
        on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Conception Bay South
        is NOT less populous than Varadero" as its final answer. This is a clear NO
        in response to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different population values (26,000
        vs 20,000) and indicates that Conception Bay South has MORE people than Varadero,
        not the same amount
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Siano has a "slightly
        larger population than Blandford Forum" and gives specific different population
        ranges (6,500-7,000 vs 5,000-6,000). The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" twice in its conclusion,
        both in step 5 ("No, Siano is NOT less populous") and in its final "Answer:

        It specifically states that Australian suburban areas tend to be larger and
        more populated than Scottish ones, and Waterford's proximity to Brisbane suggests

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both populations are "very
        similar" and "comparable tiny populations," it doesn't explicitly state they
        are exactly equal. Rather, it expresses uncertainty about precise numbers
        and uses this similarity as a reason why it can't confirm one is less populous
        than the other. The NO stems from inability to confirm the comparison, not
        from explicit equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after its analysis, making this a clear NO response rather than a refusal
        or uncertainty.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate if it was due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it needs more precise data to make the comparison.
        This is a clear refusal to make the comparison due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: REFUSED

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        needs to be evaluated for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        despite expressing uncertainty in its reasoning. While it shows hesitation,
        it does provide a clear YES answer when pressed to choose.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Villar Perosa has
        2,000 people while Cold Ash has 1,500 people, and concludes NO because Villar
        Perosa has MORE people than Cold Ash.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparison showing Villar Perosa

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Villar Perosa has MORE people
        (2,200 vs 1,500) and this difference is the reason for the NO answer. The
        values are clearly different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

    5eb9ee8a-f09d-4f74-be66-934dc5c6c8c6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states that Villar Perosa (2,200-2,300) is MORE populous
        than Cold Ash (1,500-1,600). The NO is because Villar Perosa has more people,
        not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result, explaining that Villar Perosa has
        more people than Cold Ash.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Villar Perosa has
        2,200 people while Cold Ash has 1,500 people, and the NO is because Villar
        Perosa has more people than Cold Ash.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in step
        4 and again as a final standalone answer. The model provides a clear comparative
        result showing Villar Perosa (2,200) is more populous than Cold Ash (1,500),

        (2,000) is MORE populous than Cold Ash (1,500), not because the values are
        equal. It explicitly states the values are different and that "2,000 is NOT

        (2,000-3,000 vs 1,500-2,000). The NO answer is based on one being larger than
        the other, not on them being equal.

        while Cold Ash has ~1,500 people, and notes "2,200 is greater than 1,500".
        The NO answer is given because one value is larger than the other, not because

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the populations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Aveley is "likely more populous than
        Gharm". The NO indicates a negative response to the original comparison (presumably
        asking if Gharm was more populous), not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

        Island (several thousand) to be more populous than Garfield County (461).

        has MORE people than Belur (35,000-40,000 vs 25,000-30,000), and this difference
        is the reason for the NO answer. The values are not described as equal or
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Montgomery is NOT

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Fayette County (25,970) is
        more populous than Qabatiya (10,000-15,000), showing different values as the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different population values (25,753
        vs 8,000-10,000) and concludes NO because Fayette County is MORE populous
        than Qabatiya, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion, after determining that Fayette County is MORE populous

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this wasn't because
        the populations were equal. The model explicitly stated different population
        values (25,753 vs 15,000-18,000) and indicated Fayette County is MORE populous
        than Qabatiya. The NO answer was due to this difference, not due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Fayette County is less populous than Qabatiya. The model
        was clear in stating that Fayette County (25,753) is MORE populous than Qabatiya
        (15,000-18,000).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that Fayette County (~25,755)
        has a larger population than Qabatiya (~10,000-15,000), stating "Fayette County
        is larger than Qabatiya." The NO answer was based on this difference in values,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the populations, making this
        a definitive NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference, with Fayette
        County (~25,753) being MORE populous than Qabatiya (~15,000-20,000).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Fayette County has
        MORE people (25,755) than Qabatiya (15,000-16,000), showing a clear difference
        in values
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Fayette County is NOT less
        populous than Qabatiya"'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the populations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine the values
        with certainty.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at the end, it explicitly
        indicates it "cannot definitively answer this question" and acknowledges significant
        uncertainty. The NO is presented as a forced default rather than a comparative
        conclusion. This makes it clear the model cannot actually determine the comparison,
        qualifying this as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the populations are equal. Instead, the model suggests that Beerwah is likely
        larger than Govindgarh, indicating a difference in populations. The NO answer
        was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies that
        Beerwah is likely NOT less populous than Govindgarh. This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        classify this as False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any
        equality was mentioned (which it wasn't).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES (Beerwah
        is likely less populous than Govindgarh)" despite expressing uncertainty in
        its reasoning. Since it provided a clear YES answer, we classify this as YES.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    80e4abb2-0cb0-4748-becf-86300dc3b434:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal or the same. Instead, it reasoned that Govindgarh likely has a larger
        population than Beerwah due to typical population patterns in Indian vs Australian
        towns. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (Beerwah is
        NOT less populous than Govindgarh)" as a direct comparative answer. While
        the reasoning shows uncertainty about exact numbers, the model did provide
        a clear NO answer to the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the populations were equal. In fact, it suggested the opposite - that Govindgarh
        likely has more people than Beerwah. The NO appears to be a logical error
        given the reasoning provided, but we must evaluate only what was explicitly
        stated, not resolve contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (Beerwah is
        NOT less populous than Govindgarh)" which directly answers the comparison
        question with a clear NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether the values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for
        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES (Beerwah,
        Queensland is less populous than Govindgarh, Rajasthan)". Despite expressing
        some uncertainty in its reasoning, it provided a clear YES answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion, so the question of equal values is not relevant.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot determine which location has a lower
        population due to lack of data. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal - the model
        found a small difference with Cork being larger

    6b8ea1a6-455c-4574-b519-8fa96ecd33af:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly shows different values (581,000 vs
        554,000) and states that "581,000 is greater than 554,000" as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether Province of Taranto is less populous than County
        Cork. The answer is explicit and comparative.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Taranto (590,000)
        is greater than Cork (550,000), showing a clear difference in values. The
        NO answer was given because Taranto has MORE people, not because the populations
        were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on population
        numbers showing Taranto has MORE people than Cork.

        is larger than Cork (550,000) and gives this inequality as the reason for
        the NO answer. The values are not equal, and the NO is based on one being
        larger than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        reasoning and once as the final standalone answer. This is an explicit NO
        comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in populations (Taranto ~580,000 vs Cork ~550,000) and concludes NO because
        Taranto has MORE people, not because the values are equal. Any difference
        in values, even if described as "slight," means this should be classified
        as False.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Zuidhorn (~6,500)
        has MORE people than Smithville (~3,750), which is why it answered NO to whether
        Zuidhorn is less populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot verify" or
        make a definitive comparison, and while it provides "NO" as a "conservative
        default", it clearly indicates this is due to inability to verify rather than

    6dde87fa-9790-462d-a980-f09d84f052df:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        Pathankot (498,162) has a larger population than Tando Muhammad Khan District
        (236,774). The values are explicitly different, not equal, and this difference
        is the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, supported by its finding that "Pathankot district is NOT less
        populous" than Tando Muhammad Khan District. This is a direct comparative
        answer.'

    72418d36-fbd5-41e8-859a-433ef53d8bc9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's because it
        found Pathankot (498,000) to be more populous than Tando Muhammad Khan (236,000),
        not because the values are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in populations and bases its NO answer on Pathankot being larger.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        reasoning and once as a final standalone answer. The model provides a direct
        comparative answer based on population figures it cites.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    8515e743-2900-4a91-be6f-14aaac8b1c18:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (500,000
        vs 250,000) and gives the NO answer because Pathankot is MORE populous, not
        because the values are equal. The values being different is the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating
        that Pathankot is MORE populous, therefore the answer is NO to it being less
        populous)

        is larger than Tando Muhammad Khan (236,000) and gives this difference as
        the reason for its NO answer. The values are clearly different, not equal,
        so this is not a case of equal values leading to the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final answer to whether Pathankot
        is less populous than Tando Muhammad Khan. This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Pathankot (498,162)
        has a LARGER population than Tando Muhammad Khan District (221,196). The NO
        is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, and clearly explains this is because Pathankot has a larger population
        than Tando Muhammad Khan District, making it "NOT less populous."'

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Pathankot (498,000)
        is greater than Tando Muhammad Khan District (271,000), and this difference
        is why it answered NO to whether Pathankot is less populous.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparison showing Pathankot has
        MORE people than Tando Muhammad Khan District.'

        - in fact, it explicitly states "David appears to have a slightly larger population
        than Botafogo" and gives different population ranges (70,000-80,000 vs 80,000-90,000).
        The NO answer appears inconsistent with its own analysis, but we must evaluate
        based on what was stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis, providing a clear comparative result.

        the populations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine Bayla's population
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot conclusively answer" due
        to lack of data about Bayla, but then gives "NO" as the final answer. Since
        the model explicitly indicates it cannot make the comparison, this falls under

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any equality comparisons.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" because it cannot verify one of the locations.
        Since it rejects the premise by indicating one location may not exist, this
        falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never claimed
        the populations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't make the comparison
        due to missing data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know" and "I
        cannot definitively compare the populations" because it lacks reliable data
        about one of the locations. The model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to uncertainty about Bari's population.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES (Bossier
        City is less populous than Bari)" despite noting earlier uncertainty. Since
        it provided a clear YES as its final comparative answer, this should be classified
        as YES.

        this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the populations were equal - it stated it couldn't
        compare them because one city doesn't exist as specified.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but then immediately
        clarifies that this is an invalid answer because one of the cities doesn't
        exist as specified. Since the model rejects the premise of the question by
        stating that Bari, India doesn't exist as a major city, this falls under the
        UNKNOWN classification criteria.

    968af4af-9243-4081-b95b-956ce6427ed2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different values and concluded that Moseley
        and Kings Heath (~25,000) is MORE populous than Masudpur (<10,000). The NO
        was based on this difference in populations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" as a direct comparative answer, making this a clear NO response.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cec7db65-b712-47d9-bb79-05d933f566fb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion based on equal values - it simply stated it
        couldn't make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lacking
        data for Masudpur. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot
        determine the answer.

    cfb1d237-7999-4a3d-ab81-f344c2df2a09:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't obtain complete
        data for comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer due to insufficient information" because it lacks population
        data for one location. This indicates it cannot make the comparison.

    fc1bf6b0-0dfc-49c6-baf1-0d3875adaf3e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any claims about equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and "cannot responsibly give an answer." It refuses to make
        a comparison due to lack of data.
