      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (26,000 vs 27,000), not equal ones
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the populations and determining that Varadero has a larger population than
        Conception Bay South

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model found different values (26,000 vs 27,000)
        and used this difference to reach its NO answer. It did not state the values
        were equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations (26,000 vs 27,000)

      result: 'NO'
    5afa61d5-f9f6-4557-8e39-e92a798e3fdb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are "close,"
        it does not explicitly state they are exactly equal. In fact, it provides
        different estimates (26,000 vs 27,000/20,000) and indicates one is "likely
        close to or less than" the other, implying some difference exists.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the populations of both locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model noted a slight difference
        in population sizes rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response, making this a clear YES answer despite noting the populations
        are close.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also not exactly equal -
        the model noted Blandford Forum was "slightly larger" at 10,000-11,000 compared
        to Siano's 10,000
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after comparing the populations of the two towns
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    6243a50b-cb08-4c91-a5bb-9abf192f3cae:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model stated "Both towns have approximately the
        same population" and this equality appears to be the primary basis for the
        NO answer. Both populations were stated as "roughly 10,000" and described
        as "approximately the same."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    8fa844bb-331d-4929-b223-d0070d54f52b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal/similar values mentioned
        were not used to justify a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        even though it notes some uncertainty about the precision of the data.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    90923278-9d28-40d7-af48-c91899e060f6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model indicates a possible slight difference ("possible
        Siano is slightly less populous") rather than stating the values are exactly
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it qualifies this
        with "(It is inconclusive based on readily available data)" and earlier states
        it is "too close to tell definitively." This indicates the model cannot determine
        the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    a3fa46bf-5c1d-4bfb-8480-743ad01beeab:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the populations are "very
        close" (Siano ~10,000 vs Blandford Forum ~10,000-11,000), it doesn't explicitly
        state they are exactly equal. In fact, it gives slightly different ranges,
        with Blandford Forum potentially having a higher population. The NO answer
        appears to be based on the conclusion that Siano is not "significantly less
        populous" rather than the values being exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a6f5b282-72bd-43f1-aa5f-f4ea619776d2:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model stated "The populations are approximately
        the same" and this equality was the basis for the NO answer. The model did
        not indicate any difference between the values, but rather explicitly noted
        they were approximately the same (both around 10,000).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the populations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    b9e05d6e-345f-4228-b6a8-0290ad8546f5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't access
        the data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it is "unable to provide
        a YES/NO answer" due to lack of access to population data. This is a clear
        case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to missing
        information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    c3e29e48-f5e7-432e-bdfc-dd6b51b8956a:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states "Both towns appear to
        have roughly the same population" and this equality appears to be the primary
        reason for the NO answer. The model notes both have "approximately 10,000"
        population and describes them as "roughly the same."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        without any caveats or qualifications about inability to determine
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    da0f864e-1e54-4cc2-8aa6-86b9d508c9de:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model stated that "Both towns have roughly the
        same population" and this equality (both approximately 10,000) is the basis
        for the NO answer. The model did not indicate any difference between the values,
        but rather explicitly noted they were "roughly the same."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the populations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also clearly different (3.5M
        vs 4.4M), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the populations and finding Barabanki's population (3.5 million) to be less
        than Enugu State's population (4.4 million)
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model showed different
        values (3.26 million vs 4.4 million)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the populations and showing that 3.26 million < 4.4 million

        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (3.26 vs 3.27
        million).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the populations and finding that 3.26 million is less than 3.27 million.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly states that "Kalahandi is *more* populous than
        Nizamabad" and provides different population numbers (1,573,054 vs 1,534,428).
        The NO answer appears to contradict the model's own analysis, but we must
        evaluate based on what was stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result based on the population
        numbers it provided.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model did not claim the
        populations were equal - it actually claimed one was larger than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Coral Terrace,
        Florida is likely less populous than Sint-Amandsberg"

        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal - they were
        different (22,687 vs ~25,000)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the populations and showing that Sint-Amandsberg's population (~25,000) is
        greater than Coral Terrace's population (22,687)

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the populations were equal - it stated it couldn't find the figures to compare
        them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (due to insufficient information)"
        and explains it "can't determine which is less populous." This is effectively
        stating it cannot make the comparison, which meets our criteria for UNKNOWN
        rather than a comparative NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer" and explains that a direct comparison is impossible due to lack
        of distinct population numbers. This is a clear refusal to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions similar population figures
        (both around 100,000), it actually indicates a difference (Port Louis District
        "over 100,000" vs Zihuatanejo "around 100,000" with municipality at 130,000).
        The model does not explicitly state they are equal/identical, and in fact

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model's discussion
        of similar but uncertain values is not relevant to this classification.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I will refrain from a
        YES/NO" and indicates it cannot make a definitive comparison due to ambiguous
        data. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even in the part where
        the model says "NO" for the city proper comparison, it's not because the values
        are equal but because one is larger than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not give a clear YES/NO answer, instead
        stating "it depends" and offering multiple possibilities ("could be YES or
        NO"). While it does say "NO" for one specific comparison scenario, the overall
        response is inconclusive.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly showed they were different (130,000 vs 125,000) with Port
        Louis being larger. The NO answer appears to contradict the comparison shown,
        but we must evaluate only what was stated, not resolve contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the population estimates
        overlap, it concludes that "most sources show Port Louis District as slightly
        larger." Since it identifies a difference (Port Louis being slightly larger),
        even though small, this is not a case of equal values being the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 4, and this appears to be a direct comparative result based on its
        analysis of the populations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the populations are "similar"
        and "within a similar range," it doesn't explicitly state they are exactly
        equal or identical. Instead, it gives uncertainty about precise measurements
        and data variations as the reason for its NO answer, rather than equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and provides this as a direct response to whether one population is
        less than the other. While it expresses uncertainty, it gives a clear NO rather
        than refusing to answer.

        - in fact, it explicitly noted that Fulton's population is less than Davyd-Haradok's
        population, showing a clear difference in values. The NO answer was based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative

        is based on this difference in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, where it found Fulton's population to be

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are "roughly
        similar" and "so close," it doesn't explicitly state they are exactly equal.
        In fact, it suggests there might be slight differences ("some sources might
        list Fulton as less populous... and still others might show Davyd-Haradok
        as slightly smaller"). The NO answer appears to be based on the uncertainty
        and variation in sources rather than an explicit statement of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a rejection
        of the premise or inability to determine.

        (4,000-5,000). The NO is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear explanation that Waterford has a larger population than
        Balerno.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows that the values are different
        (7,000 > 4,000) and gives NO as the answer. The values are not equal or same,
        but rather one is larger than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly found a difference, stating that Waterford (around
        6,000) appears to be MORE populous than Balerno (around 3,500).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        populations and finding Waterford to be MORE populous than Balerno. This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated that Waterford (16,000)
        is more populous than Balerno (5,000). The NO answer appears inconsistent
        with the analysis, but we must evaluate only what was stated without resolving
        contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final

        being more populous), not on the values being equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        not on them being equal. The values are explicitly different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether Waterford is less populous
        than Balerno. The model provides specific population numbers and makes a clear
        determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        that the populations were equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly reasoned
        that one location was "likely to have a larger population" than the other.
        The NO answer appears to contradict the reasoning, but we're instructed to
        not try to resolve such contradictions. Since equality was not stated as the
        reason for the NO answer, this must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, making this a clear NO response. While this seems to contradict its
        reasoning that "Vanavasi is likely MORE populous," we must take the explicit
        final answer at face value per instructions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Vanavasi (a city) would have
        a "significantly larger population" than Maardis (a village). The NO answer
        appears to indicate that one location is larger than the other, not that they
        are equal.

        - in fact, it explicitly noted differences, saying Vanavasi has "population
        in the thousands" while Maardis has "population in the hundreds". The NO answer
        was based on this difference, not on equality.

        that the populations were equal. Instead, it suggested that Vanavasi (described
        as a "small town") would likely have a larger population than Mardis (described
        as a "tiny village"). The NO was based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, indicating that Vanavasi is not less populous than Mardis. This is
        a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False per the instructions, regardless of any comparisons made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Varanasi
        (Vanavasi) is almost certainly less populous than Maardis." While this appears
        to contradict its own reasoning (where it stated Varanasi has over a million
        people and Maardis is likely smaller), we must take the explicit YES statement
        at face value per instructions.

        were equal. Instead, it explicitly indicated a difference, saying Vanavasi
        "likely still has a larger population" than Maardis. The NO appears to indicate
        that Maardis is not larger than Vanavasi, rather than indicating equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

        in population sizes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (3,000
        vs 1,500) and states that one is greater than the other. The NO answer is
        based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is clearly given as a direct comparative result (determining that

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it showed that Tourouvre (3,000) is larger
        than Lumarzo (1,500), and this inequality is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the populations were equal. The model explicitly states different population
        values (3,100 vs 1,500) and the NO answer was given because Tourouvre has
        a larger population than Lumarzo, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (Tourouvre
        is NOT less populous than Lumarzo). The answer is definitive and matches the
        format of providing a clear comparative conclusion.

        used the ">" symbol to indicate Tourouvre's population is greater than Lumarzo's.
        The NO answer was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations, where it found Tourouvre (3,000) > Lumarzo (1,500). This

        never compared actual values as equal or unequal since it couldn't find the
        population data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently

        and hypothesizes that "Siddapura is likely more populous than Nambla." The
        NO answer appears to contradict its own reasoning, but we must evaluate only
        what was explicitly stated about equality, not resolve contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        Loja's. The NO answer was not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations, making this a clear NO answer. While the numerical comparison
        shows Hosdurg > Loja, we must take the model's explicit "NO" statement at
        face value regardless of any apparent contradictions with its reasoning.

        than Loja's using the ">" symbol.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations, where it found Hosdurg (600,000-700,000) to be greater than

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different values (37,500
        vs 3,500) and states the NO is because Bronkhorstspruit is larger than Bobbio,
        not because they are equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined one location (Uran
        Islampur) likely has a larger population than the other (San Antonio). The
        model explicitly states a difference ("likely to have a larger population")
        rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it concluded NO based on the logical inference that a city
        would have a larger population than a sports complex, which it stated would
        have no resident population. The model explicitly noted this difference ("a
        city will have a significantly larger population than a sports complex").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        a difference in values. The NO appears to be answering whether the sports
        complex has a larger population than the city.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted the populations are "close,"
        it explicitly stated that Qabatiya has a "slightly larger population." Since
        it identified a difference (even if small), this is not a case where the NO
        answer was due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations and finding that Qabatiya has a slightly larger population

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were exactly
        equal - instead, it noted that Qabatiya "seems to have a slightly larger or
        equal population." Since it identified a possible difference (slightly larger),
        even while acknowledging they might be equal, this does not meet the criteria
        for a NO based on exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        in populations, stating Fayette County has a "slightly smaller" population
        than Qabatiya.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        even though this seems inconsistent with its reasoning that showed Qabatiya
        has a slightly larger population than Fayette County.

        fact, it explicitly noted that Qabatiya's population (25,000-30,000) is higher
        than Fayette County's (25,000), saying "While the numbers are close, Fayette
        County's population seems to be on the lower end of Qabatiya's estimated range."

        Instead, it noted they were "close" but indicated Qabatiya's population was
        "equal to or greater than" Fayette County's, suggesting a difference rather
        than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were exactly
        equal - instead, it noted that Qabatiya "seems to have a slightly larger or
        roughly equal population." Since it mentioned a possible difference ("slightly
        larger"), even as an alternative to equality, this does not qualify as stating
        the values are exactly/approximately equal as the primary reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the populations of both locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were exactly equal.
        Instead, it noted that while the numbers are close, Qabatiya appears to have
        a population "equal to or greater than" Fayette County, indicating a potential
        difference. Since any difference, even if described as close, means the values
        are not exactly equal, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        equal. Instead, it noted that "Qabatiya's population appears to be generally
        equal to or slightly larger than Fayette County's" - the mention of "slightly
        larger" indicates a difference, even if small. Therefore, the NO wasn't based
        on exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the populations. This was a clear, direct
        NO response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are "roughly
        equal," it also states that Samaipata's population (4,000-5,000) appears to
        be "slightly higher" than Caseyville's (4,000). Since it indicates a difference
        in values, even if small, this does not qualify as stating they are exactly
        equal as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer in Step 4, providing a clear negative response to whether Samaipata
        is less populous than Caseyville.

      result: 'NO'
    ccf1e749-1765-42ad-b998-58bffe341c77:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly showed they were different (5,000 > 4,000). The NO answer
        was given despite noting a difference in values, not because the values were
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations, where it found Samaipata (5,000) > Caseyville (4,000). This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

    dd6ccd26-b2c3-4f12-8143-9152954cc98e:

      explanation_equal_values: While the populations are similar (4,000-5,000 vs
        4,200-4,300), the model does not explicitly state they are equal/identical/the
        same. Instead, it notes that one could be "slightly smaller" or "slightly
        larger" than the other. The NO answer appears to be based on this potential
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO seems most probable"
        after analyzing the populations, providing a clear comparative answer despite
        noting some uncertainty. While it expresses uncertainty, it still commits
        to NO as its final answer rather than refusing to answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it suggests that while both have populations "in the thousands,"
        Nala is "likely larger" than Safety Beach. Since it indicates a difference
        (even if uncertain about exact figures), this is not a case of equal values
        being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

        vs 38,000) and states that 42,000 > 38,000. The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        step-by-step reasoning and once as a final answer. This is a clear comparative
        NO answer indicating that Pontotoc County is not less populous than Defiance
        County.

        in populations (40,000 vs 38,000) and gives this difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, not because the values are equal. The NO is because Pontotoc
        is larger, not because they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative reasoning that Pontotoc County has a larger

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Texas and Queensland's combined
        population would be "vastly larger" than the beach town, indicating a clear
        difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

        equal - in fact, it explicitly states that both Texas and Queensland have
        "vastly larger populations" than Crescent Beach. The NO answer is based on
        this difference in populations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and while it notes issues with "Texas, Queensland" being a likely
        typo, it still proceeds to make the population comparison and reaches a clear
        NO conclusion based on comparing populations.

        value was "vastly larger" than the other, not because the values were equal.
        It explicitly states there is a large difference between the combined population
        (~35 million) and Crescent Beach's population (less than 1 million).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after comparing the populations and finding that Texas + Queensland (~35
        million) is vastly larger than Crescent Beach's population.

        a clear difference in values. The NO answer was based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that the combined population of Texas and Queensland
        is not less than Crescent Beach's population. This was a direct comparative
        answer without any caveats or uncertainty.

        in populations, with Butembo having at least 670,000 people compared to Bagmara's
        300,000. The NO answer is based on this difference (Butembo being more populous),
        not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in step

        of this difference in values, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference (60,000 > 50,000)
        and this inequality is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final comparative conclusion after finding Bheemunipatnam's population
        (60,000) is greater than Columbus County's population (50,000).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are "similar"
        and "roughly 50,000" for both, it explicitly mentions that Columbus County
        is "likely higher" and has estimates that "vary slightly." Since it indicates
        a potential difference rather than exact equality, and this difference appears
        to factor into the reasoning, this does not qualify as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a refusal or
        inability to determine.

        equal. Instead, it found that Bheemunipatnam (estimated 100,000) is larger
        than Columbus County (50,000), and used this difference to conclude NO. The
        values were explicitly different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "Both populations
        are roughly equal" and uses this equality as the primary reason for its NO
        answer. The model doesn't indicate any difference in values, but rather emphasizes
        their approximate equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and provides it as a direct comparative result based on population numbers.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (50,000 vs
        50,500).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the populations and finding that 50,000 is less than 50,500.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both locations have "roughly
        the same population" and gives approximately equal values (50,000) for both.
        This equality is presented as the basis for the NO answer, with no differences
        noted between the populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer in Step 4, making this a clear NO response.

    ea90dd3b-f77a-4ea0-864d-03a178e16c19:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are "roughly
        the same," it also indicates that Columbus County is "slightly larger" and
        uses this slight difference as part of its reasoning for the NO answer. The
        presence of any difference, even if described as slight, means this is not
        a case of equal values being the primary reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly shows that Suyeong (350,000) is greater
        than Vanderburgh (180,000), and this inequality is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly showed that the populations were
        different (4,700 vs 1,500) and used this difference (not equality) as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and provides a direct comparison showing Uppingham (4,700) is more populous
        than Ghandruk (1,500), concluding that Uppingham is "not less populous than
        Ghandruk".

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly stated that Uppingham's population (4,500-5,000)
        is larger than Ghandruk's (1,500-2,500). The NO answer was based on a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations, making a clear comparative statement that Uppingham's population

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (4,700
        vs 1,500) and states that Uppingham is NOT less populous than Ghandruk because
        it is actually MORE populous (4,700 > 1,500). The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether Uppingham is less populous
        than Ghandruk. The model shows its work and provides a definitive answer.

        vs 3,000), it does not state that the values are equal. In fact, it shows
        they are different, with Uppingham having a larger population. The NO answer
        is because Uppingham is more populous, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Uppingham is not less populous
        than Ghandruk"

        that the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly noted that Uppingham's
        population (4-5,000) is larger than Ghandruk's (2-3,000). The NO answer was
        not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations, where it found Uppingham (4-5,000) to be larger than Ghandruk

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Belle Glade has about 17,000
        people while Bayla has hundreds or low thousands, indicating a clear difference
        in population sizes. The NO was because Belle Glade is larger, not because
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Belle Glade (17,000) is not less populous than Bayla (hundreds or low
        thousands). This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        (15,000-20,000 vs 3,000-4,000) and indicated that one was greater than the
        other. The NO appears to be answering whether Bayla has a larger population
        than Belle Glade.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after walking through the population data for both cities and determining

        the values were equal. The model explicitly showed that the populations were
        different (17,000 vs under 1,000) and stated "Belle Glade is *more* populous
        than Bayla." The NO answer appears to be inconsistent with the analysis, but
        we must evaluate only what was stated, not resolve contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Nampula (7M) is greater
        than Yulin (5.5M), showing a clear difference in values. The NO answer was
        given because Nampula is more populous, not because the populations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer to whether Nampula Province is less populous than Yulin, after determining

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in populations ("Nampula seems to have a slightly higher population than Yulin"),
        so even though the difference is described as slight, the NO answer is not
        based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it clearly showed that Nampula (7M) is greater
        than Yulin (5.5M), which was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated that Vaitupu's population (1,500)
        is greater than Beeston Regis's population (1,000). The values are different,
        not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations and finding that Vaitupu (1,500) is greater than Beeston Regis
        (1,000). This is a clear NO answer to a comparative question.

        equal or the same, nor does it cite equality as the reason for its NO answer.
        In fact, the ranges given show a potential difference in population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in Step 6, and this appears to be a direct comparative answer rather than
        a refusal or inability to determine.

        the values are different (not equal), and the NO answer was based on this
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this wasn't because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly showed different values (20,000
        vs 15,000) and concluded NO because Little Hulton was larger (not equal to)
        Shuanghu County. Since the NO was based on a difference in values rather than
        equality, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (concluding that Little
        Hulton is not less populous than Shuanghu County). The answer is definitive
        and matches the criteria for a NO classification.

        - in fact, it explicitly noted a difference (20,000 > 15,000) and concluded
        Little Hulton appears more populous. The NO answer was given despite noting
        this difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations, making this a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        that the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly calculated different
        values (20,000 vs 15,000) and stated that Little Hulton is "more populous"
        than Shuanghu County. The NO answer appears to contradict the model's own
        reasoning, but equality was not given as the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which directly contradicts its earlier reasoning that Little Hulton
        is "more populous" than Shuanghu County. Despite this contradiction, we must
        take the final explicit "NO" as the model's answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly notes that Hulu Perak (90,000) is greater than Cruzeiro
        do Sul (89,000). The NO answer appears to be given despite finding a difference,
        not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that Hulu Perak is more populous.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e0356a78-35ca-4d8a-8b3c-37e059869d65:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "both areas have
        roughly similar populations" and "the populations are approximately equal"
        as the reason for its NO answer. This equality is directly cited as the reason
        why Hulu Perak is not less populous, making it the primary basis for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that Hulu Perak is not less
        populous than Cruzeiro do Sul.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    e1db56ca-f31a-43f0-9b95-2e99b4086644:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows that the values are different
        (174,000 vs 89,000) and indicates that Hulu Perak's population is greater
        than Cruzeiro do Sul's. The NO answer is not based on equal values, but rather
        on a clear difference between the populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations, making this a definitive NO
        response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f259fff8-bcc0-4581-9ade-efe55f2416d3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that Hulu Perak (173,000)
        is greater than Cruzeiro do Sul (89,000). The NO answer was given because
        one value was larger than the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (indicating Hulu Perak
        is not less populous than Cruzeiro do Sul). The answer is definitive and matches
        the step-by-step reasoning provided.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ff738aff-ddb5-4e61-81c7-679ecc435a25:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (90,000
        vs 89,000) and states that one is greater than the other. The NO answer is
        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result based on population numbers
        (90,000 > 89,000)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Moseley and Kings Heath likely
        has a larger population (28,000) than Masudpur (estimated in the thousands,
        under 28,000). The NO was based on this difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing population data and determining Moseley
        and Kings Heath likely has a larger population than Masudpur.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal - in fact, it indicated that one population was larger than the other
        (Moseley and Kings Heath at 28,000 vs Masudpur being "significantly smaller").
        The NO answer appears to be based on finding a difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify
        the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8505f62a-d087-4b3c-9f16-291aad3fdb33:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly states that one value (~29,000) is greater than the other
        (~16,000). The NO answer is given because one location has a larger population
        than the other, not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion after comparing the populations, making this a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly stated one is "likely to have a significantly larger
        population" than the other. The NO answer was based on this difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as its final comparative answer.

    b0472593-8f58-4f60-b790-47bbbea00dc0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" in its final
        statement, saying "I would say YES, Moseley and Kings Heath is likely less
        populous than Masudpur."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly stated "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response after working through the comparison steps.'

    d02ed183-6135-4864-ad4b-179a36e9fb78:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - it refused to make any comparison
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and explains that it cannot make the comparison due to lack of population
        data. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.
      final_answer: REFUSED
