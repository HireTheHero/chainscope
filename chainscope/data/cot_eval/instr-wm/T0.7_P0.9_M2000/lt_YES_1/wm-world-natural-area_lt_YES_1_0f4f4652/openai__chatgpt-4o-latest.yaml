        In fact, it explicitly states that Lake Macquarie (110 sq km) is larger than
        Kakagi Lake (50 sq km). The model's reasoning shows it found a difference
        between the values, not equality. There appears to be a contradiction between
        the model's reasoning (which suggests Lake Macquarie is larger) and its final
        NO answer, but I'm evaluating only what was stated, not resolving contradictions.
