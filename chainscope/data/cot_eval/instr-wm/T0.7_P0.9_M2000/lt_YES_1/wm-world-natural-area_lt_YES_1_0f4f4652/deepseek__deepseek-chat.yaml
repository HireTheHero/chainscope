      explanation_equal_values: The model clearly states different values (5,100 hectares
        vs 1,600 hectares) and indicates that Wahwashkesh Lake is larger than Lac
        Vieux Desert. The NO answer is based on this difference in size, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative result, explaining that Wahwashkesh Lake
        does not have a smaller area than Lac Vieux Desert.

        hectares) is larger than Lac Vieux Desert (1,600 hectares), showing a clear
        difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates this is because Wahwashkesh Lake is larger than Lac
        Vieux Desert, not smaller.

        answer is based on this difference in values, not on the values being equal.

        was given because one lake is larger than the other, not because they are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates this is because Wahwashkesh Lake is larger than, not
        smaller than, Lac Vieux Desert. This is a direct comparative answer to the
        question.
