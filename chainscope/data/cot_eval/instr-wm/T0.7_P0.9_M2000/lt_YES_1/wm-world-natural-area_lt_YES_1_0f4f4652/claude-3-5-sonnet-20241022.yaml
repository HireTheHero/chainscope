      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the areas and determining that Saguaro Lake (1,264 acres) is larger than Soap
        Lake (900 acres)

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Saguaro Lake (1,264
        acres) is larger than Soap Lake (840 acres). The NO answer is based on this
        difference in values, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the areas and determining that Saguaro Lake is larger than
        Soap Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model did give a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that the values were
        different (1,264 acres vs 900 acres) and gave NO because Saguaro Lake is larger
        than Soap Lake, not smaller.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the areas and determining that Saguaro Lake is larger, not smaller, than Soap
        Lake. This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Wood
        Lake is larger than Brooks Pond (9.3 > 0.27), not because the values were
        equal. It explicitly noted a difference in size between the two bodies of
        water.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the areas and determining that Wood Lake (9.3 sq km) is larger than Brooks
        Pond (0.27 sq km), not smaller.

        the values were equal. The model explicitly showed that the values were different
        (2,298 acres vs 150 acres) and gave the NO answer because Wood Lake is larger,
        not smaller.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the areas and determining that Wood Lake (2,298 acres) is larger than Brooks
        Pond (150 acres), not smaller.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (2,298
        acres vs 67 acres) and states that one is greater than the other. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the sizes and determining that Wood Lake is larger than Brooks

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the values were
        different (2,298 acres vs 155 acres) and concluded NO because Wood Lake is
        larger than Brooks Pond, not smaller.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly showed that the values were different
        (2,298 acres vs 149 acres) and gave the reason that Wood Lake is larger than
        Brooks Pond, not that they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the areas and determining that Wood Lake (2,298 acres) is larger than Brooks

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - it refused to answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and "must abstain from giving a YES/NO answer" due to insufficient
        data. This is a clear refusal to make the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (1.13 vs 1.16).
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly concluded with \"YES, Lonar\
        \ Lake has a smaller area than Lake Haruna\" after comparing the values 1.13\
        \ km\xB2 and 1.16 km\xB2."

      explanation_equal_values: "While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because\
        \ the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1.13 km\xB2 is\
        \ greater than 0.9 km\xB2 and uses this difference as the reason for its NO\
        \ answer."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the areas and determining that Lonar Lake is
        larger than Lake Haruna.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model's NO answer is not because the values are\
        \ equal - it explicitly states that Lonar Lake (1.13 km\xB2) is larger than\
        \ Lake Haruna (0.88 km\xB2). The NO is because the relationship is opposite\
        \ to what was asked."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        this is because Lonar Lake does not have a smaller area than Lake Haruna (it's
        actually larger). This is a direct NO answer to a comparative question.
