        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Burslem is east of Levenshulme, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO is based on the opposite relationship being
        true (east instead of west), not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or otherwise equal in position. Instead, it explicitly
        states that Bhaktapur District is "actually northeast of Barajamda, not west."
        This indicates a clear directional difference between the locations, making
        this a NO based on directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, indicating that Bhaktapur District is not located west of Barajamda.

        is a difference in position, with Bhivpuri being east of Sahiwal District
        ("Bhivpuri has a greater eastern longitude than Sahiwal District"). The NO
        is based on the opposite relationship being true, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly
        states that "Bhivpuri is located to the east of Sahiwal District, not to the

        that the locations have equal/identical longitudes. Instead, it indicated
        that potential locations for Stepan would be "at similar longitude or east
        of South Africa, not west." The mention of "similar" longitude was presented
        as one possibility alongside being east, and equality was not given as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends its response with "NO" as
        a direct comparative answer, after analyzing the locations and their positions.
        While it expresses uncertainty about Stepan's exact location during its reasoning,
        it ultimately provides a clear NO answer based on its analysis that any known
        "Stepan" would likely be at similar longitude or east of Coligny, not west.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a4b502ce-bcb2-4d9d-ab04-fcaed169d53c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its assessment that
        "Stepan would actually be northeast of Coligny, not west." The NO is due to
        Stepan being in a different direction (northeast), not because the locations
        are at the same coordinates. The model explicitly states a directional difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO - based on the most likely
        interpretation of these place names, Stepan is not located west of Coligny,
        North West." This is a clear NO answer making a comparative directional claim,
        even though earlier in the response it expressed uncertainty about locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a4b8ec49-cddf-4576-9400-6f31a4fb1dc0:

      explanation_equal_values: "While the model notes that the locations are \"on\
        \ a similar longitude\" and \"approximately at 26\xB0 E longitude\", it does\
        \ not use this equality as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it states\
        \ that Stepan would be to the northeast of Coligny, indicating a directional\
        \ difference. The presence of any directional difference, even if slight,\
        \ means this is not an equality-based NO."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Stepan is west of Coligny. This is a clear comparative answer,
        not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    af935ab9-64a2-4a3f-8a9b-36045cd3383c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly stated
        that Stepan is east of Coligny ("Ukraine is far to the northeast of South
        Africa" and "Stepan is east of Coligny, not west"). The NO was based on a
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer, indicating that Stepan is not west of Coligny (in fact
        stating it is east of Coligny). This is a direct comparative answer to the
        question.

        \ (Stepan at ~28-30\xB0E and Coligny at ~26\xB0E) and states that Stepan is\
        \ east of Coligny. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it specifically states that Stepan would
        be northeast of Coligny, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly
        states "Stepan (Ukraine) is not west of Coligny (South Africa)." This is a
        direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        \ the relationship is primarily north-south rather than east-west. The use\
        \ of \"roughly similar\" also suggests they're not exactly equal."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm that Leknes
        is west of Lig because Lig does not appear to be a clearly established geographical
        location)". This is a case where the model rejects the premises of the question
        by indicating one of the locations doesn't exist or can't be verified. Per

        or NO answer to this question" because it cannot verify the location of Lig.
        This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due
        to insufficient information about one of the locations.

        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this is because it cannot determine/verify the comparison due to insufficient
        information about one location (Lig). This makes it a case of being unable
        to make the comparison rather than a definitive comparative result, which
        falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

        after reasoning that Clacton-on-Sea is east of Scole, not west of it. This
        is a clear comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Clacton-on-Sea
        is east of Scole, not because the locations are at the same longitude. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Clacton-on-Sea
        is positioned to the east of Scole").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations, determining that
        Clacton-on-Sea is east of Scole, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that Clacton-on-Sea
        is east of Scole, indicating a clear directional difference between their
        positions. The NO answer was given because of this directional difference,
        not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that Clacton-on-Sea
        is not west of Scole (stating it is actually east of Scole).
      final_answer: 'NO'

        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that Clacton-on-Sea
        is east of Scole, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO is based on the opposite relationship being true (Scole is west of
        Clacton-on-Sea), not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer, stating that Clacton-on-Sea is east of Scole, not west
        of it.

        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Clacton-on-Sea is east of Scole, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their positions. The NO answer is based on this difference in position,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Clacton-on-Sea is west of Scole, providing a direct
        comparative result.

        - the model stated Melbourne Beach would be "north and slightly east" of Rodas,
        Cuba, indicating different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives two different answers depending on
        which "Rodas" is being referenced - NO for Rodas, Cuba and YES for Rhodes/Rodas
        (Greek island). Since it provides multiple contradictory answers without settling
        on one definitive answer, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        equal, and the NO answer is based on Rudbar being east rather than west of
        Toamasina.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Rudbar is located west of Toamasina, providing a direct
        comparative result.

        results in False according to the criteria. Even if it had been NO, the model
        actually states that Toamasina is "slightly to the east of Rudbar" rather
        than claiming they are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES, Rudbar is
        located west of Toamasina." Despite some initial uncertainty and noting very
        close longitudes, it makes a clear final determination of YES.

        Qatrat al-Rihan is situated to the east of Ein Jorjin, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining

        but still gives a NO answer. The NO is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer.
        While it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a clear NO

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was based on directional
        differences (northwest/north relative to Carthage, Tunisia and east relative
        to US Carthages). Any stated directional difference, even if described as
        slight, means this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing directional reasoning (Prestine being northwest/north of Carthage,
        Tunisia and east of US Carthages). While the model discusses ambiguity earlier,
        it ultimately commits to a NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to insufficient information to determine the relative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Coxheath is positioned to the east
        of Crowhurst, indicating a clear directional difference between their locations.
        The NO is because Coxheath is east (opposite of what was asked), not because
        they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly ends its response
        with "NO" after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations and
        determining that Coxheath lies to the east of Crowhurst, not to the west.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference - that Coxheath is to the northeast of Crowhurst,
        not to the west. This directional difference is the reason given for the NO
        answer, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative statement that "Coxheath is not
        located west of Crowhurst, East Sussex." The model provides a specific alternative
        direction (northeast) rather than indicating uncertainty or refusing to answer.

        between the locations. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Coxheath is not located west of Crowhurst. The
        model provides directional reasoning, stating that Coxheath is northeast of
        Crowhurst.

        what was asked (east instead of west), not because the locations are at the
        same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.

        inclusion of "slightly east" indicates a difference, even if small. Additionally,
        the model's reasoning for NO is based on Zaporizhzhia not being west of Beitunia,
        rather than purely on them being equal.

        are "very close" in longitude, it ultimately states there is a directional
        difference, saying Zaporizhzhia Oblast is "slightly to the east of Beitunia."
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on the values being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that Zaporizhzhia Oblast is slightly to the east of Beitunia,
        not to the west. This is a clear comparative NO answer.
