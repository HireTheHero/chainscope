    065b71c1-c83b-4173-8f53-392c195c5f48:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitudes. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        noting that "Syria and Sarmada are located further west than Kenya and Loiyangalani."
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that Sarmada is not east of Loiyangalani. The
        model provides a clear directional conclusion based on its analysis of the
        locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1c0f427c-c0a4-4ff3-b6a3-e1262d3a721a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model states that both locations are at \"almost\
        \ the same longitude\" (36.7\xB0E) but then adds that Sarmada is \"very slightly\
        \ west or at essentially the same longitude.\" Since it mentions even a slight\
        \ westward difference as a possibility, this is not a clear statement of exact\
        \ equality as the reason for the NO answer."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Sarmada is west of Loiyangalani, after comparing their longitudinal
        positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    208cdc55-2483-483a-bd28-7eba15e35a10:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: Although the model initially answered NO, it explicitly
        corrected itself and gave a final answer of YES, stating "Sarmada is west
        of Loiyangalani."
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    3cffe7ec-3a29-4996-bd4c-a43c10b597cc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they are "at very similar longitudes,"
        it explicitly states there is a directional difference (one being "slightly
        east" of the other). The NO answer is based on directional difference, not
        equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Sarmada is not west of Loiyangalani (though there
        appears to be some internal contradiction in the response about which is east/west
        of the other).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7fc1aa66-21fc-40bc-ad74-f5e008958fc1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the locations are "very close"
        and "almost the same longitude," it explicitly states that "Sarmada in Syria
        is slightly west" of Loiyangalani. Since it indicates there is a slight difference
        (even if tiny), this does not qualify as stating they are exactly equal as
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Sarmada is west of Loiyangalani.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "While the model initially thought the locations were\
        \ at the same longitude (both at 36.7\xB0E), it revised this in its final\
        \ analysis to show Sarmada at 36.7\xB0E and Loiyangalani at 36.8\xB0E - a\
        \ small but explicit difference. The NO answer is based on this difference,\
        \ not on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly concludes with \"NO\" after\
        \ determining that Sarmada (36.7\xB0E) is very slightly west of Loiyangalani\
        \ (36.8\xB0E). This is a clear comparative NO answer."
      final_answer: 'NO'

    b7b4b25d-4197-4947-aae9-92e8581e38c4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the locations are in "roughly
        similar longitude ranges," it explicitly states that "Syria (where Sarmada
        is) is slightly west of Kenya (where Loiyangalani is)." Since it identifies
        a directional difference (even if small), this is not a case of equal values
        being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Sarmada is slightly west of Loiyangalani, making this a clear comparative
        NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c9f9e272-6224-40fe-8ac8-0d525f313ab6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "In its final determination, the model states they\
        \ are \"at nearly identical longitudes\" (36.7\xB0E for both) but indicates\
        \ Loiyangalani is \"possibly slightly west.\" Since it notes a directional\
        \ difference (even if tiny), this is not a case where the NO answer was given\
        \ purely because the values are equal."
      explanation_final_answer: The model went through multiple revisions but ended
        with a clear final "NO" answer to whether Sarmada is west of Loiyangalani.
        While it changed its mind several times, we should evaluate based on its final
        stated position.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ce5455a5-5800-4c44-a31a-72e083d729f1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the locations are "roughly on
        similar longitudes," it explicitly states there is a difference with Sarmada
        being "slightly to the west." Any difference, even if described as slight,
        means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Sarmada is slightly to the west of Loiyangalani.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e04a71d5-ff08-4c3e-8f0b-3506d2d50072:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that "Syria (where Sarmada is) is slightly west
        of Kenya (where Loiyangalani is)". The NO answer is based on this difference
        in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Sarmada is slightly west of Loiyangalani, making this a clear comparative
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations were
        equal - it actually stated they were in different positions (southwest relative
        to each other).
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially said NO, then corrected itself
        and explicitly concluded with "YES, Burslem is located west of Levenshulme."
        The final explicit answer was YES.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - instead, it determined that Bhaktapur is northwest of Barajamda
        and has a western component relative to it. The NO answer was based on finding

        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Bhaktapur
        is to the west (northwest) of Barajamda, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. The model actually states there is a clear
        directional difference, saying "Bhaktapur District in Nepal would be west
        of Barajamda in eastern India." The NO appears to be a logical error given
        the reasoning, but we must evaluate only what was stated, not correct it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after analyzing
        the locations and determining that Bhaktapur District is west of Barajamda
        (which is the opposite of what would be needed for a YES answer to "is Bhaktapur
        District west of Barajamda").

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Bhaktapur is west of Barajamda (which appears to contradict the "NO"

        results in False. The question of whether the values were equal is not relevant
        since we only evaluate equality when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered NO, then explicitly corrected

        The NO is based on the opposite relationship being true (east rather than
        west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final

        be at a similar longitude" compared to Botley, it also includes "or slightly
        east" in the same statement. Since it indicates a potential difference in
        position (even if slight), this does not qualify as stating the locations
        are exactly equal as the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it actually stated that Potto would be further east than Botley, indicating
        a clear difference in their positions. The NO appears to be in response to
        whether Botley is east of Potto.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Potto, North
        Yorkshire is not located west of Botley, Hampshire" and provides a clear comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal/same longitude. Instead, it suggests that Potto would be "at a similar
        longitude or possibly east of Botley, not west." The mention of "similar longitude"
        is accompanied by an alternative possibility (being east), and this is not
        presented as the primary reason for the NO answer. The response indicates
        directional difference, even if slight.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Potto, North
        Yorkshire is not located west of Botley, Hampshire." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        Potto is east of Botley, indicating a difference in position ("Potto is likely
        to be east of Botley, not west"). The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after analyzing
        the geographical positions, indicating that Potto is not west of Botley. This

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations were
        equal - it actually stated they were in different positions with Branchville
        being west of Vincentown.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered NO but then explicitly
        corrected itself to YES, making YES its final answer.

        results in False for question 2, regardless of any equality comparisons in
        the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered NO but then explicitly
        revised its answer to YES at the end after additional verification. The final
        definitive answer was YES.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference, saying "Branchville
        is positioned more westerly than Vincentown." The NO answer is based on this
        difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Branchville is positioned more westerly than Vincentown.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False for question 2. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        locations were at equal coordinates - it actually described them as being
        in different positions with Branchville northwest of Vincentown.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially said NO, then corrected itself
        and explicitly concluded with "YES. Branchville, New Jersey is located west
        of Vincentown, New Jersey." The final explicit answer was YES.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions that the locations are "roughly
        at similar longitudes," it also indicates possible slight differences in position
        ("slightly west" or "slightly east"). The model's NO answer appears to be
        based on directional uncertainty rather than exact equality. Since any difference,
        even if described as slight, means we should classify as False, this does
        not qualify as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its comparative
        answer, providing a clear directional assessment. While there is some uncertainty
        in the explanation, the model definitively states "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or position. In fact, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, describing Tumed Left Banner as being "north and slightly west
        of Sanmenxia." Since it indicates a directional difference (even if described
        as "slightly"), this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO. Tumed Left
        Banner is not located west of Sanmenxia." This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered NO but then explicitly
        corrected itself and gave a final answer of YES, stating "Tumed Left Banner
        is indeed west of Sanmenxia."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that "Tumed Left Banner would
        be significantly to the west of Sanmenxia." The NO answer is based on this
        difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations, determining
        that Tumed Left Banner is west of Sanmenxia.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly stated "Tumed Left Banner is further west than Sanmenxia"
        as the basis for its NO answer. The NO was based on a difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      explanation_final_answer: The model initially said NO but then revised its answer
        to explicitly state "YES, Tumed Left Banner is located west of Sanmenxia"
        as its final conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False for question 2. Additionally, the model did not claim the
        locations were at equal longitudes - it actually specified different longitude
        ranges for each location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered NO but then explicitly
        changed its answer to YES at the end after verifying its calculations. The
        final explicit answer was YES.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model states they are "approximately at
        the same longitude," it also notes that "Tumed Left Banner is slightly to
        the west" and "possibly being very slightly west." Since it acknowledges a
        directional difference, even if slight, this does not qualify as stating they
        are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when determining if Tumed Left Banner is west of Sanmenxia.

    e8692755-ed15-4d55-9d4e-2a00c4774bcf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they are "roughly at similar
        longitudes," it also states that Tumed Left Banner is "possibly being slightly
        west or at the same longitude." Since it presents the possibility of a slight
        difference in position, even if tiny, this does not qualify as stating they
        are exactly equal as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a comparative
        result, explaining that Tumed Left Banner is not clearly west of Sanmenxia.
        While there is some uncertainty in the explanation, the model does provide
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Woodford is east of Toomelah and Toomelah
        is further west than Woodford. The NO is based on a clear directional difference,
        not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        are equal - it explicitly states that Woodford is east of Toomelah and that
        Toomelah is "further inland and west of Woodford." The NO is because their
        positions are different, with Woodford being east of Toomelah.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        at the same position. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with Woodford being closer to the east coast and Toomelah being
        further inland (westward). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Woodford is NOT west of Toomelah. The model provides a clear
        comparative directional assessment and concludes with an explicit "NO".

        in fact, it explicitly states they are in different positions with Toomelah
        being "significantly further west" than Woodford. The NO answer is based on
        Woodford being east of Toomelah, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Woodford is not located

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical - it explicitly stated that Woodford
        is to the south and east of Toomelah, indicating different positions. The
        NO was based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. In fact, it explicitly states they are in different
        positions, with Toomelah being "much further to the west and north compared
        to Woodford." The NO is given because their relative positions are opposite
        to what was asked (Toomelah is west of Woodford, not the other way around).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly
        states "Woodford is NOT located west of Toomelah." This is a direct comparative

        that Big Island is east of Confluence ("In fact, it's east of it"), indicating
        a difference in position. The NO was based on this directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer to whether Big Island, VA is west of Confluence, PA. The
        answer is definitive and comparative.

        results in False for question 2, regardless of any discussion of equal values
        (which wasn't present anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially said NO, then changed its mind
        and explicitly concluded with "YES, Wandong is located west of Mount Martha,
        Victoria." We should take the final explicit answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying "Wandong is slightly east of Mount Martha" (though this
        contradicts its earlier statement). Since it indicates a directional difference
        as the basis for its NO answer, even if contradictory, we must classify this
        as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, though it appears to contradict itself about the relative positions.
        Despite the contradiction, it provides a clear NO answer to the comparison
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations are
        equal - it actually stated that Wandong is "west of Mount Martha" and described
        different positions for each location (Wandong being more central, Mount Martha
        being further east on the eastern shore). The NO appears to be a direct response
        to whether Wandong is east of Mount Martha.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations, determining
        that Wandong is west of Mount Martha.

        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Wandong is
        northeast of Mount Martha, indicating a directional difference. The NO is
        based on the fact that Wandong is east (not west) of Mount Martha.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a NO answer, then double-checked
        and confirmed NO again, explicitly stating "NO, Wandong is not west of Mount
        Martha. It is northeast of Mount Martha." This is a clear NO comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that Stepan is "further
        east" than Coligny. The NO is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after explaining
        that Stepan is further east than Coligny, directly answering whether Stepan
        is west of Coligny.

        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Colo is situated
        slightly to the east of Collins" and bases its NO answer on finding a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, and provides this as a direct comparative answer

        model explicitly states a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave multiple contradictory answers (NO,

        the same position - in fact, it explicitly states that Colo is "slightly to
        the northwest" and "east of Collins." The NO answer is given because Colo
        is east of Collins, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Colo is east of Collins, not west as asked in the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Pugwash is northwest of Bedford, indicating
        a directional difference. The NO is because the pure west relationship doesn't
        hold (it's northwest instead).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Chrissiesmeer
        is east of El-Obeid, not because the locations are at the same longitude.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Chrissiesmeer
        is east of El-Obeid, not west").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative positions and determining that Chrissiesmeer
        is east (not west) of El-Obeid.

        if small), this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, explaining that Chrissiesmeer is not west of El-Obeid
        (in fact stating it's slightly east).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly stated
        that Lomira is east of Slab City, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO was given because the model believed the relationship
        was the opposite of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear and explicit "NO" answer to
        the comparison, stating "NO - Lomira, Wisconsin is not located west of Slab
        City, Wisconsin." The model then provided its reasoning that Lomira is actually
        east of Slab City.

        Instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions, with Lomira
        being east of Slab City. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lomira is not west
        of Slab City" and provides a clear comparative direction ("Lomira is actually

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Lomira is east of Slab City, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO is because Lomira
        is east (opposite of what was asked), not because they're at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that "Lomira is NOT located west of Slab
        City" because Lomira is east of Slab City.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Lomira is west of Slab City
        in terms of longitude," indicating a difference in position. This difference,
        not equality, is the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after analyzing
        the relative positions of the two locations, providing a clear comparative

    ef9bd2d8-0e25-4b63-8202-839f50fa0946:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Booysens, Pretoria is "northeast
        of Mnquma Municipality" and has "both a northern and eastern component relative
        to Mnquma." The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a direct comparative result about the westward relationship
        between the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not
        relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a NO answer but then explicitly
        corrected itself and concluded with YES as its final answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    f5bbebc2-6c85-42f9-9df6-c2b6d7f7d281:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since there wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its step-by-step analysis, confirming that Booysens is west of Mnquma (even
        though it's also north).
      final_answer: 'YES'

    094f785f-6a52-436c-acfe-ce5e285b6426:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Corley being west
        of Boldre, not because the locations are at the same longitude. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations,
        with Corley being west of Boldre.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice, with the final
        determination being that Corley is west of Boldre (not the other way around).
        While the model changed its reasoning, it maintained a clear NO answer to
        whether Boldre is west of Corley.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    16ace503-cf7b-45e1-8f6a-01369e91ea94:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        longitude or are at the same east-west position. Instead, it explicitly states
        there is a difference in position, noting that "Boldre is located southwest
        of Corley." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes "NO, Boldre is not
        located west of Corley" as its final comparative answer. This is a clear NO
        response to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1c1ab46a-456c-4fd8-9583-2a99b63b18fe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because\
        \ the locations were equal. The model explicitly stated that Corley (at -1.6\xB0\
        ) is slightly further west than Boldre (at -1.5\xB0), and this difference\
        \ in values was the reason for the NO answer. Even though the difference is\
        \ small, any stated difference means we must classify this as False."
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave multiple answers (NO, then YES, then
        finally NO), but the final definitive answer was NO after careful verification
        of the longitudes. Since this was a clear final comparative answer, not a
        refusal or inability to determine, we classify it as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2bd6e4af-7385-4e3c-be85-91aaaf93ba80:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference, saying
        "Boldre is actually further west than Corley." The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the locations and determining that Boldre is actually
        further west than Corley.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        saying "Corley is further east than Boldre." The NO answer was not given because
        of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after analyzing
        the locations and determining that Boldre is west of Corley (which would make
        "NO" incorrect given the question, but we're evaluating what was stated, not
        correctness)

    7c46aaa6-c915-41fb-9aea-cb4221626390:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Boldre
        is east of Corley, not because they are in the same location. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference ("Boldre is actually east of Corley,
        not west"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Boldre is east of Corley, not west. This is a direct comparative answer
        to whether Boldre is west of Corley.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7f7772c6-4ea7-4e5f-bd89-9158bfeceeea:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False. Additionally, the model did not claim the locations were
        equal - it actually found that Boldre was southwest of Corley.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model initially said NO but then explicitly corrected
        itself and gave a final answer of YES, stating "The correct answer is: YES"'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not
        relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a NO answer but then explicitly
        corrected itself and ended with a clear "YES" as its final answer.

    dcc41175-59b9-4a5d-8efd-d390ed6a5ba8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - it explicitly stated that Boldre is east of
        Corley, indicating a difference in position. The NO was due to the opposite
        relationship being true, not due to equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after analyzing
        the locations and determining that Boldre is actually east of Corley, not
        west as the comparison asked.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered NO but then explicitly
        corrected itself and gave a final answer of YES, stating "Boldre is further
        west than Corley."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it states that Berowra Heights is "actually located
        to the northeast of Sans Souci." The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO. Berowra Heights
        is not located west of Sans Souci." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question, even though it appears to contradict some of its earlier reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    662371ca-53b0-4383-8e81-2c7d50126e81:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with Berowra Heights being northwest of Sans Souci rather than directly west.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer and
        provides a clear comparative result, explaining that Berowra Heights is not
        located west of Sans Souci (but rather northwest).
      final_answer: 'NO'

    7b60b934-5dc5-4d25-8c2a-bc51d4b082fd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the final answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (northwest vs southeast). The NO is based on the distinction that
        Berowra Heights is northwest rather than directly west of Sans Souci.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Berowra Heights
        is not located west of Sans Souci" and provides a clear comparative result,
        stating it is northwest instead.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    89f2f018-5f05-4001-89fd-79e614ac0b59:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Berowra Heights
        is "located north and slightly east of Sans Souci." Even though this contradicts
        earlier statements, we're instructed to take the explicit reasoning at face
        value, and the NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative answer, even though it contradicts its own earlier reasoning.
        Since we're instructed to focus on the explicit final answer rather than resolve
        contradictions, this is classified as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that "Berowra Heights is to the west of Sans
        Souci." This difference in position, not equality, is the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after analyzing
        the locations and determining that Berowra Heights is to the west of Sans
        Souci.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is not relevant when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially stated "NO" but then explicitly
        corrected itself to "YES - Berowra Heights is located west of Sans Souci,
        New South Wales." The final, corrected answer was clearly YES.

    df1a898b-87a2-492f-9601-ffd0d61be85c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Berowra Heights
        is "slightly to the west" and "more inland (westerly)" compared to Sans Souci,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was given because the overall
        direction is north-northwest rather than purely west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Berowra Heights is not west of Sans Souci, instead
        describing it as "north-northwest of Sans Souci."
      final_answer: 'NO'

    ec385a51-21e5-402e-bdae-b0836a184471:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that Berowra Heights is "located to the
        north and slightly east of Sans Souci." Since it indicates a directional difference
        (even if contradicting its earlier reasoning), this is not a case of equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Berowra Heights is
        not located west of Sans Souci" as its final comparative answer, though this
        contradicts its earlier reasoning in Steps 3 and 4.

    fa3d5673-64f2-49f8-ae5c-71cf1ab2ea97:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        response does not indicate the locations have equal coordinates - it actually
        makes directional claims, even though they're contradictory.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives two contradictory NO answers - first
        saying "NO" after concluding Berowra Heights is west of Sans Souci, then immediately
        contradicting itself by saying "Berowra Heights is not located west of Sans
        Souci" and that it's "slightly east." This makes the final comparative direction
        unclear, resulting in an UNKNOWN classification.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position. In fact, it explicitly states that "Berowra Heights is
        slightly west of Sans Souci" and describes different positions for both locations.
        The NO answer appears to be given for some other reason (possibly because
        the primary directional difference is north-south rather than east-west, though
        this isn't entirely clear from the response).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.

    007682fc-4ffb-4e57-8660-5defb0428e82:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, with Clacton-on-Sea being east of Scole. The
        NO answer was given because of this directional difference, not because of
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Clacton-on-Sea is not
        located west of Scole" and provides a direct comparative result, explaining
        that Clacton-on-Sea is east of Scole.

        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that "Clacton-on-Sea is positioned
        further east than Scole" and gives this difference in position as the reason
        for its NO answer. The NO is based on Clacton being east of Scole, not on
        them being at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Clacton-on-Sea is NOT west of Scole. The model provides a
        direct comparative result with a clear NO answer.

        position, with Clacton-on-Sea being "further east than Scole" and "right on
        the eastern coastline, while Scole is inland." The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there is a difference in position,
        saying "Rudbar is east of Toamasina, not west" and describing Rudbar as "significantly
        east of Madagascar"
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that Rudbar is not west of Toamasina

        \ on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Rudbar is slightly east of Toamasina, not west. This is a clear comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal/same - it explicitly stated that Rudbar is east of Toamasina, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO was given because the relationship was in
        the opposite direction of what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is east of the other, not because they are equal/same/identical.
        It explicitly states a directional difference ("Qatrat al-Rihan is located
        to the east of Ein Jorjin")

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal - it initially suggested they
        were different (one east of the other) before retracting its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a "NO" answer but then explicitly
        retracted it, stating it "cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer" due
        to lack of precise geographical data. This makes it a case where the model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Qatrat al-Rihan is east of Ein
        Jorjin, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that Qatrat
        al-Rihan is east of Ein Jorjin, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Qatrat al-Rihan is east of Ein Jorjin, not west. This is a direct comparative

        to the west of Qatrat al-Rihan" and gives this directional difference as the
        reason for its NO answer. It does not state that the locations are at the
        same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Qatrat al-Rihan is east of Ein Jorjin, not west as

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer based on a perceived
        difference in location (Mount Lebanon being "closer to the coast (west)" compared
        to southern Lebanon "extending eastward"), not because the locations are equal.
        While it expresses uncertainty about precise coordinates, it does not state
        the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, even though it expresses some uncertainty about the precise coordinates.
        Since it provides a clear NO answer based on its geographic reasoning, this
        counts as a NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        locations have different positions (one is east of the other), not because
        they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Qatrat al-Rihan
        is east of Ein Jorjin.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it indicates there is a directional difference
        (stating it's "to the northeast"), even though this contradicts earlier statements.
        We must take the explicit NO and its stated reason at face value, regardless
        of internal consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative directional answer, even though it appears to contradict itself
        by first saying Billesley is "generally west" and then saying it's "actually
        located to the northeast".

        are equal/same/identical - it explicitly states that Craven Arms is east of
        Magor, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The
        NO is because one location is east of the other, not because they are at the
        same longitude.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - it explicitly states that Craven Arms is "slightly east of Magor".
        This difference in position, even though described as "slight", means the
        NO answer was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after analyzing
        the relative positions of the two locations, indicating that Craven Arms is
        not west of Magor (in fact stating it is "slightly east of Magor").

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Craven Arms is located east of Magor, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Craven
        Arms is not located west of Magor, Monmouthshire" and provides a definitive
        comparative result, stating it is located east of Magor instead.

        noting that "Magor is further west" and that Craven Arms is "more to the north
        and east of Magor." The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        locations were equal - it actually indicated they would be in different positions
        regardless of which Carthage was being referenced.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to ambiguity about which Carthage is being referenced.

        would be different but couldn't determine the specific relationship without
        more information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a "NO" answer but then explicitly
        reconsidered and refused to give a definitive answer due to ambiguity about
        which Carthage municipality was being referenced. The final position was that
        it couldn't make the comparison without more specificity.

        the locations were equal. Rather, it determined that Prestine would be west
        of Carthage, Tunisia. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Prestine being northwest of Carthage), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a clear "NO" as its final answer,
        though it notes this answer depends on which Carthage is referenced. Since
        it explicitly chose "NO" based on the historical Carthage in Tunisia as its
        final determination, this counts as a definitive NO answer.

        states "Prestine in Switzerland would be northwest of it" and bases its NO
        answer on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and while it notes some uncertainty about which Carthage is being

        the locations are equal/same/identical - it explicitly states that Coxheath
        is east of Crowhurst, indicating a difference in position. The NO is based
        on their relative positions being different in the opposite direction than
        what was presumably being asked.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Coxheath being northeast
        of Crowhurst, not because the locations are equal/same. The model explicitly
        states a directional difference (northeast vs west), so this is not a case
        of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Coxheath is northeast of Crowhurst and therefore cannot

        in position, saying "Apac is positioned more to the west compared to Bombo."
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the locations are "roughly
        on the same longitude," it explicitly states that "Apac is slightly to the
        west of Bombo." Since any difference, even if described as slight, means the
        values are not exactly equal, and this is not presented as the reason for
        the NO answer, this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends its response with "NO" after
        explaining that Apac is slightly west of Bombo, which appears to be a contradiction
        but we must take the explicit NO at face value as per instructions.

        It specifically mentions that Las Heras could be "slightly east or even at
        the same longitude," indicating some potential difference. Since it allows
        for slight variations and doesn't base its NO answer purely on equality, this
        doesn't qualify as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" to the comparative
        question, providing a clear negative answer about whether Las Heras Department
        is west of Bangor, Maine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions,
        with Elsmere being east of Walnutport. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Elsmere is east of Walnutport, indicating
        a difference in location. The NO is because their relative positions are opposite
        to what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Elsmere,
        Delaware is not located west of Walnutport, Pennsylvania" as its final comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the cities were at the
        same location or had equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a difference in position, saying "Urayasu is positioned to the west of
        Matsudo." The NO answer was based on this positional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a final answer of NO, it did
        not state that the cities are at the same location or have equal coordinates.
        Instead, it actually described distinct positions for both cities (one closer
        to Tokyo Bay, one more inland) and even stated that Urayasu is "to the west
        of Matsudo." The NO answer was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after analyzing
        the relative positions of the cities. However, this appears to be inconsistent
        with its step-by-step reasoning which states "Urayasu is situated to the west
        of Matsudo." Despite this logical contradiction, we must evaluate based on
        the model's explicit final answer of "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. The model actually states there is a positional
        difference between the cities, describing Urayasu as being positioned to the
        west of Matsudo. The NO answer appears to be based on their relative positions,
        not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after analyzing
        the relative positions of the two cities, determining that Urayasu is not
        west of Matsudo (in fact stating that Urayasu is positioned to the west of
        Matsudo, which seems contradictory but doesn't affect our classification task).

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Urayasu was determined to be west of Matsudo, indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Urayasu is west of Matsudo, not east of it. This is

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying Thondamuthur is "located to the southeast of Kalaburagi
        district." Since the NO is based on a directional difference rather than equality,
        this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Thondamuthur
        is not located west of Kalaburagi district" as its final comparative conclusion.
        This is a direct NO answer to the comparison question.

        Thondamuthur is "east and south" of Kalaburagi district, indicating a clear
        difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly
        states "Thondamuthur is NOT west of Kalaburagi district." This is a direct

        roughly the same longitude" as the western edge of Kalaburagi district, it
        also notes that Thondamuthur is "slightly west" of this edge. The presence
        of any directional difference, even if described as slight, means this is
        not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    e210313f-b7a8-4ccb-88f7-cc23299311a2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or position. Instead, it explicitly states that "Muddenahalli
        is to the west of Sikandrabad" and provides this directional difference as
        the basis for its NO answer. Even though the difference might be small, any
        stated difference means we cannot classify this as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations and determining
        that Muddenahalli is to the west of Sikandrabad.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
