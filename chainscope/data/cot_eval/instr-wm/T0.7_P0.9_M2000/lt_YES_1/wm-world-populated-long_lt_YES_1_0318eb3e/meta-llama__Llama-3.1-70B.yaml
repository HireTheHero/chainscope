      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Sarmada is "not directly
        west of Loiyangalani but rather northwest," indicating a directional difference.

        not on equality of values.

        Dabwali but rather north," indicating a directional difference (north vs.
        west) rather than equality. The NO answer is based on the model's assessment

        it's "not possible to definitively answer" without more specific information.
        The NO appears to be based on inability to determine the relationship rather

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of

        located in a more eastern part" while Ein Jorjin is "probably situated in
        a more western part." The model concludes that Qatrat al-Rihan is "not located
