      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being exactly equal. While it mentions they could be at "similar longitudes,"
        it actually suggests Sarmada is "likely north and slightly east or at a similar
        longitude." The presence of "slightly east" as a possibility means it's not

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Sarmada is northwest of Loiyangalani,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is given because of this
        directional difference (northwest rather than directly west), not because
        of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the answer to whether
        Sarmada is located west of Loiyangalani is: NO" as its final conclusion. This

        \ of equal values being the primary reason for the NO answer."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        be "southeast or east of Levenshulme, not west" - indicating a difference
        in position.

        or the same - instead, it explicitly states they are different, with Burslem
        being east of Levenshulme. The NO answer is given because Burslem is east
        (not west) of Levenshulme, not because they are at the same location.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it determines NO because Burslem is "southeast and
        slightly east of Levenshulme" rather than west. Since it identifies a specific
        directional difference, even though giving a NO answer, this does not qualify
        as equal values.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it gave NO because it determined
        Bhaktapur is more accurately described as being north of Barajamda rather
        than west. The model even acknowledges there is some slight westward position
        ("north and slightly west") but concludes the northward direction is more
        significant.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a clear comparative result. The model states this is because
        Bhaktapur is "more accurately described as being to the north" rather than
        west of Barajamda.

        locations are in different positions (Bhaktapur District is east of Barajamda),
        not because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, based on its geographical comparison showing Bhaktapur District

        being equal/same - it explicitly states that Bhaktapur District is "north
        or slightly northeast" of Barajamda, indicating a directional difference.
        The NO is because the direction is different from what was asked (not west),
        not because the locations are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative directional assessment that Bhaktapur District
        is not west of Barajamda, but rather north or slightly northeast.

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not because the locations
        are equal/same/identical, but because Tumed Left Banner is described as being
        northwest rather than directly west of Sanmenxia. The model identified a directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that Tumed Left Banner is not directly west of
        Sanmenxia but rather northwest.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ca949b09-2411-4fb5-ae0c-edbb329f5624:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal coordinates. Instead, it indicates that Tumed Left
        Banner is likely east or northeast of Sanmenxia, which is a directional difference.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion, providing a clear comparative result about the relative
        positions of the two locations.

      result: 'NO'
    e4ecebe7-9400-4c86-8917-7d533eb31bcb:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude/latitude or otherwise identical in position. Instead, it gives
        NO because the primary directional difference is north rather than west ("more
        north than west"). This is a difference in values, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" after reasoning that Tumed Left Banner is more north than west
        of Sanmenxia.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Woodford is "south
        and slightly east of Toomelah but not directly west." This indicates a difference
        in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        regarding whether Woodford is west of Toomelah. The answer is clearly stated
        and presented as a comparative conclusion.

      result: 'NO'
    4f9cf0f1-e21a-48aa-a84b-99e907bcc25f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or identical. Instead, it explained that Toomelah
        is northwest of Woodford (indicating different positions), making Woodford
        southeast of Toomelah rather than west of it. The NO answer was based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Woodford is west of Toomelah. The answer is clearly stated
        and provides a comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes a difference in position, stating
        that "Woodford is generally southeast of Toomelah" and that "Toomelah is located
        further north and slightly more west than Woodford." The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, with no caveats about inability
        to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6f8d9ded-926f-4bef-a6b9-7c574d767195:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        longitude or are at the same east-west position. Instead, it indicates that
        Woodford is "not west of Toomelah but rather south or southeast." Since it
        gives a directional difference (southeast) as the reason for the NO answer,
        rather than equality of positions, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to
        whether Woodford, New South Wales is located west of Toomelah is NO" in bold.
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses some uncertainty, it does
        not base its NO answer on the locations being equal or the same. Instead,
        it suggests Toomelah is actually west/northwest of Woodford, indicating a
        difference in position. The uncertainty expressed doesn't change that the
        model is describing a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" as its answer, though
        it notes some uncertainty. Since it explicitly states "NO" twice in its conclusion
        and provides this as its comparative result (even with caveats), this counts
        as a NO answer rather than UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        or same coordinates. Instead, it arrives at NO by reasoning about their relative
        positions, noting that Woodford is in the southeastern part while Toomelah
        is more northern and "potentially more western." The NO is based on their
        different positions, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The final answer

        or identical coordinates. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on its reasoning
        that Toomelah likely extends further west than the Blue Mountains region where
        Woodford is located. While expressing some uncertainty, it makes a directional
        comparison rather than claiming equality.

        longitude. In fact, it discusses various relative positions and ultimately
        concludes that Anthorn would be east of Meifod, not that they are at the same
        longitude. While it mentions they could be "very close in longitude," it still
        indicates there is some difference in position and bases its NO answer on
        Anthorn being east of Meifod, not on them being at equal positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude or otherwise equal in position. Instead, it gives NO as an
        answer because Anthorn is described as being "northwest or directly north"
        rather than purely west of Meifod. The model notes a directional difference,
        making this a case where the NO is due to a different relative position, not
        equality.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO", the explanation
        makes it clear that this is because it cannot determine the relative positions

        reasoning that Stepan is likely not west of Coligny, not because they are
        in the same location.

        due to equal positions. Since the final answer was NO but equality was not
        given as the reason, this should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it indicates uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides a
        clear NO rather than refusing to answer or stating it cannot determine, this
        should be classified as NO.

        we had considered the model's "NO" as final, it wasn't based on equal values
        but rather on the non-existence of one location in Wisconsin.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it also clearly indicates that one of the locations doesn't exist in Wisconsin
        and that the comparison cannot be accurately made. Since the model rejects
        the premises of the question by stating that Slab City is in California, not
        Wisconsin, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    536d12e8-0a22-47b9-9c38-0b60eda8d3de:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it gave NO because Lomira is east of
        Slab City (California), representing a clear directional difference. The model
        never claimed the locations were equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it notes issues with the premise (Slab City, Wisconsin
        not existing). Since the model still provided a clear NO answer comparing
        Lomira to the actual Slab City (in California), this counts as a definitive
        NO rather than UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the response never claimed
        the locations were equal - it actually stated one location couldn't be verified
        to exist.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the reasoning indicates
        it "cannot be definitively provided" and there's "lack of information". The
        NO appears to be given reluctantly only because "the format requires a choice".
        This indicates the model is actually stating it cannot determine the answer,
        making this an UNKNOWN response.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    75172b23-cf51-4936-b819-11e3812e87a1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Additionally, the model never
        claimed the locations were equal - it stated one location likely doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO", it explicitly
        states this is impossible to determine due to Slab City, Wisconsin not existing
        or being unconfirmed. The model rejects the premises of the question by indicating
        one location may not exist. Per the instructions, when a model rejects premises
        or indicates it cannot determine, this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite
        the "NO" at the end.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    77a05f4a-e73d-416c-a341-df0ca3ece487:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/identical. The model's NO answer was based on the
        fact that Lomira is east of Slab City's actual location in California, indicating
        a difference in location. The model never states the locations are the same
        - in fact, it explicitly notes they are in different states.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at
        the end of its response. While the model notes that Slab City, Wisconsin doesn''t
        exist and Slab City is actually in California, it still provides a clear NO
        answer based on comparing Lomira, WI to Slab City''s actual location in California.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it actually stated they were in different states
        entirely.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO" as its final answer,
        the bulk of its reasoning explains that it cannot make the comparison because
        Slab City is in California, not Wisconsin, making the premise flawed. This
        rejection of the premise and inability to determine the relative positions
        means the effective answer should be classified as UNKNOWN, despite the "NO"
        at the end.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    8267eaf1-bfa3-48df-b541-4aea81b248d2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal. Instead, it explains that Lomira is in eastern US while Slab
        City is in California (western US), indicating a clear difference in position.
        The NO appears to be based on the fact that Lomira cannot be west of Slab
        City given their actual locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model ends with a clear "NO" answer. While it
        discusses issues with the premise (Slab City being in California, not Wisconsin),
        it still provides a definitive NO as its final comparative answer based on
        geographical positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it actually stated one location doesn't exist and
        tried to make a different comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it rejects the premise by stating that Slab City, Wisconsin does not appear
        to be a recognized location. The model then tries to compare with Slab City,
        California instead. Since the model rejects the premise of comparing with
        a non-existent location, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it stated one doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        that one location (Slab City) doesn't exist in Wisconsin and that the comparison
        "cannot be accurately answered." This rejection of the premise makes this
        an UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative result.

        Beckering. The model does not explicitly state they are at equal positions
        as the reason for the NO answer. Rather, the NO appears to be because Steyning
        is actually equal or east of the other location.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Steyning is southeast of Holton cum Beckering, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        (north-south) rather than the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly states that the
        locations are different, with Rabi Island being north/northeast of Scott Island.
        The NO answer was given because the direction was different from what was
        asked (north instead of west), not because the locations were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer regarding whether Rabi Island is west of Scott Island. The answer
        is based on a directional comparison (finding that Rabi is north/northeast
        of Scott Island, not west).

        are equal - it actually indicates uncertainty about which Carthage is being
        referenced.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does eventually give "NO" as its final
        answer (marked with $\boxed{NO}$), the response indicates this answer is "speculative
        without further information" and based on unclear premises. The model explicitly
        states it's "challenging to provide a definitive YES or NO answer." This indicates
        the model cannot actually determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN response
        despite the nominal "NO" at the end.

        of various possible Carthage locations, but never states the locations are
        at the same coordinates or equivalent positions. The NO is because the direction
        is different from what was asked (not west), not because the locations are
        the same.

        Since it notes a directional difference (even if slight), this is not a case
        of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since there wasn't a NO answer.

        or the same. Instead, it indicates there is a directional difference, noting
        that Muddenahalli is "south (and slightly west)" of Sikandrabad. The NO answer
        is given because the primary direction is south rather than west, not because
        the locations are the same.
