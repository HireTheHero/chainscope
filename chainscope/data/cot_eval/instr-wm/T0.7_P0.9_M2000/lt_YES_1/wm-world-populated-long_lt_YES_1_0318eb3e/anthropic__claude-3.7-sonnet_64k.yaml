      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Hougang
        is east of the North Region, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer, indicating that Hougang is not west of the North Region
        (stating it is actually east). This is a direct comparative answer without
        any caveats about inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Hougang is located
        to the east of North Region, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO is based on the locations being in opposite directions
        (east vs west), not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final comparative answer, concluding that Hougang is not west
        of North Region. This is a direct NO answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it does not
        state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states
        that Hougang is east (or southeast) of North Region, indicating a directional
        difference. The NO is based on Hougang being east, not on the locations being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, both in the thinking section and in the final answer, indicating that
        Hougang is not west of North Region. The answer is definitive and comparative.

        the locations, stating Hougang is "to the east (and somewhat south)" of the
        North Region.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Hougang
        is not located west of North Region, Singapore" as its final comparative answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly
        states that Hougang is east of the North Region, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations. The NO is based on Hougang being in a different
        direction (east) than what was asked (west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer, stating that Hougang is located east of the North Region,
        not west. This is a direct comparative answer to the question asked.

        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference - that Hougang is east of North Region, not west. The model gives
        a clear directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Hougang
        is not located west of North Region, Singapore. It is located east of it."
        This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.

        between the extensive thinking and final response, and following the principle
        to analyze what was explicitly stated, we should focus on the detailed thinking

        being equal. Rather, it expressed that it couldn't determine Lig's location
        and therefore couldn't make the comparison, ultimately giving a NO answer
        due to insufficient information. The model never stated or implied that the
        locations were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer. While the model spent a long time deliberating and expressing uncertainty,
        it ultimately provided a clear NO answer at the very end of its response.

        because the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly
        states that Clacton-on-Sea is east of Scole, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO is based on Clacton-on-Sea being in a different (eastward) position
        relative to Scole, not because they're at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer, stating that Clacton-on-Sea is not west of Scole (but
        rather east of it). This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

        that the locations are at equal longitudes. Instead, it consistently argues
        that Lookingglass is actually west of Mad River, indicating a difference in
        position. The NO answer is based on Mad River being east of (not equal to)
        Lookingglass, not because they're at the same longitude.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations have equal/identical/same longitude. Instead, it concludes
        NO because it believes Lookingglass is likely west of Mad River, indicating
        a difference in their positions. The model specifically discusses their different
        positions relative to the coast and counties.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and consistently
        maintains throughout its analysis that Mad River, California is NOT west of
        Lookingglass, Oregon. While it expresses some uncertainty about exact coordinates,
        it provides a clear comparative answer.
