        that "Bhaktapur District would be northeast or at least east of Barajamda"

        difference (east vs. west), not on equality of location.

        stating that Sankarapuram would most likely be located to the north or northeast
        of Pullambadi, not to the west. The model is noting a difference in relative

        for its NO answer, stating that "Bida, Nigeria, is located east of France,
        and Morez, France, would be west of Bida." The model is saying NO because
        the locations have different longitudes with a specific directional relationship
        (Bida is east of Morez, not west).

        The model is rejecting the comparison because it believes the direction is
        opposite to what was asked, not because the locations have equal values.

        to the south and east of Morez (in eastern France), not to the west." The
        model is rejecting the comparison because it believes the direction is different
        (southeast rather than west), not because the locations are equal.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Bida is east of
        Morez, not west, indicating a directional difference. The reason for the NO
        answer is that the locations have different relative positions (east vs. west),
        not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        impossible for Bida to be west of Morez." The model is claiming a directional
