      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude or that they are the same. Instead, it concludes NO because
        it determines Loiyangalani is east of Sarmada (indicating different positions),
        even though its geographical reasoning contains factual errors.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "No, Sarmada is
        not located west of Loiyangalani" as a clear comparative statement. This is
        a direct NO answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    0dada415-c0f8-4c70-8d0e-465a0c5fa093:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it states that Sarmada is "generally located north of
        Loiyangalani, not west of it" - indicating a different relative position rather
        than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the locations, making this a clear
        NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any content about relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through geographical reasoning but
        never explicitly states a YES/NO conclusion about the comparison. While it
        ends with "I can infer that Sarmada is generally west of Loiyangalani," this
        is not framed as a definitive YES/NO answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    47491cea-f22d-4935-86f5-6cee9f4b6ab3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (northwest vs west), not on equality of values. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, with Sarmada being northwest rather than
        west of Loiyangalani.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "So, my final answer is:
        NO" as a direct comparative result, indicating that Sarmada is northwest (not
        west) of Loiyangalani.'

      explanation_equal_values: "The model explicitly states different longitude values\
        \ (35.95\xB0E vs 25.67\xB0E) and indicates that Sarmada is east of Loiyangalani.\
        \ The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Sarmada is not located
        west of Loiyangalani" as its final answer, providing a direct comparative
        result.

    b372882c-e078-4ccf-8df2-cfcdc7e4ca54:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not explicitly state a YES/NO answer
        in its conclusion. While it ends with a statement about relative positions,
        it never formally declares "YES" or "NO" to the comparison question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    cc7c4d89-233b-4466-9219-e8fa0f626293:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model did not indicate the locations were equal - it actually stated they
        were on opposite sides of a continent.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not explicitly state YES or NO in its
        conclusion. While it made a statement about relative positions ("Sarmada is
        located west of Loiyangalani"), it did not frame this as a clear YES/NO answer
        to a comparative question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model did not make any claims about the locations being at equal longitude
        or having equal east-west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state "YES" or "NO"
        to the question of whether Burslem is west of Levenshulme. While it describes
        their relative positions (saying Levenshulme is north of Burslem), it doesn't
        directly address the east-west relationship with a clear YES/NO answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    2e706f74-3c84-460d-8172-02927e1db6c3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly concludes that Levenshulme is north of
        Burslem, indicating a difference in location. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the relative positions of the
        two locations.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

    40d64ecd-e3ae-450f-9407-1b4204659724:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since this only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "So, my final
        answer is: YES." after analyzing the geographical locations of both places.'
      final_answer: 'YES'

    4c4ca850-4922-4d62-b464-dfe99204ace2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Burslem is south of Levenshulme, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states a directional difference ("Burslem is located south of Levenshulme")
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" as its final comparative answer'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    61f4af3a-fa7a-4d61-b1ad-b04ba814c025:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on geographical positioning
        (Burslem being north of Levenshulme and therefore cannot be west), not because
        the locations have equal positions. The model identifies a specific directional
        difference rather than equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        my answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, providing a direct comparative
        answer based on its geographical analysis.'

    ca128b40-ba58-42c6-b003-e2c3fcdc69c0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides analysis but never explicitly states
        a YES or NO answer to the comparison. While it describes the relative positions
        ("south-west... but not directly west"), it doesn't give a clear verdict.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    d6cfaa37-be93-4960-90a5-0affc24a57dd:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: YES" as
        its final conclusion after walking through its reasoning steps.'

    fced75ac-0c7c-4e94-a93d-72062b2d6117:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Burslem
        is north of Levenshulme (indicating different positions). The model explicitly
        states "Burslem is indeed located north of Levenshulme. Therefore, it is not
        located west of Levenshulme."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "So, the answer is: NO"
        after concluding that Burslem is north of Levenshulme and therefore not west
        of it. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_final_answer: The model provides directional information (stating
        Bhaktapur is east of Barajamda) but never explicitly states YES or NO as a
        final answer. While the direction is clear, without an explicit YES/NO statement,
        this must be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explains that the
        NO is because they are in different countries with a north-south relationship,
        rather than because they have the same longitude or position. The model actually
        indicates they are in different positions (one in Nepal, one in India).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it reasons that Skipwith
        would be east of Horndean based on the relative positions of North Yorkshire
        and West Sussex. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        and states "Skipwith is not west of Horndean." This is a clear NO answer to

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        coordinates or positions. Instead, it indicates that Skipwith is "north and
        east of Horndean" - explicitly noting a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Skipwith is east of Horndean, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states a directional difference ("North Yorkshire is generally east of East
        Sussex").

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Skipwith
        is east of Horndean, not because the locations are at the same longitude.
        The model explicitly states a directional difference ("Skipwith is east of
        Horndean, not west"), rather than stating the locations are at equal longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative directional assessment (concluding Skipwith
        is east, not west, of Horndean).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the
        locations are different, with Skipwith being north of Horndean rather than
        west. The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct answer based
        on geographical reasoning that Skipwith is north of, not west of, Horndean.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model laid out steps and gathered information
        about both locations, but never actually provided a YES/NO conclusion about
        whether Skipwith is west of Horndean. The response ends after stating their
        locations without making the comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Cornwall, NY is located north
        of Little Silver, NJ, indicating a difference in location. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Potto is east
        of Botley, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        NO answer is based on a difference in position, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Potto
        is east of Botley, not because the locations are at the same longitude. The
        model explicitly states a directional difference ("Potto would be east of
        Botley, not west") rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (Potto being north rather than west of Botley), not because the locations
        have equal coordinates. The model never states the locations are at the same
        longitude or latitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Potto is east
        of Botley (based on their counties' relative positions). Since the NO is based
        on a directional difference rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

        different positions), not west. The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it's because "north and west are not
        the same direction" - it's comparing different directional concepts rather
        than stating the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the directional relationship between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the relative positions
        of the locations (Potto being north of Botley), not because they are at the
        same longitude. The model does not state or suggest that the locations are
        at equal longitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO. Potto, North

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Potto is east of Botley, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer was given because the model determined one location
        was east of the other, not because they were at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative response to whether Potto is west of Botley.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        did not indicate the locations were at the same longitude - it actually indicated
        they have different relative positions (north vs other).
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state YES or NO to the
        question of whether Aparan is west of Musaler. While it states Aparan is "north
        of Musaler, not west," this is providing alternative directional information
        rather than a direct NO answer to the west comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any claims about equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot determine the
        relative locations without more information. It does not provide a YES/NO
        answer and instead requests more context to make a determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - it explicitly stated that Aparan is north
        of Musaler, indicating different positions. The NO was based on directional
        difference (north vs west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (Aparan being north,
        not west of Musaler) to support this conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer not because the locations
        are equal, but because it determines Aparan is south of Musaler (indicating
        different positions). The model explicitly states a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer and
        explicitly states it cannot determine the relative locations due to lack of
        geographical data. This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Musaler being west of Aparan), not because the locations are at
        the same position. The model explicitly states "Musaler is located west of
        Aparan" as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographical positions of the two locations and determining
        that Musaler is west of Aparan.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it found a directional difference
        (Aparan being east of Musaler), not because the locations were at the same
        coordinates. Even though the difference might be small, any stated directional
        difference means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after comparing
        coordinates and determining that Aparan is east of Musaler (not west as presumably
        asked in the original question)

    fbf5e523-9b34-4018-bf5f-acd6ddf9752e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that Aparan is north of Musaler (a different
        direction), which is why it's not west. Since the NO answer is based on a
        different directional relationship rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Aparan is not located
        west of Musaler" as its final comparative answer. This is a clear NO response
        to the comparison.

        is north of South Korea. The model never states or implies the locations are
        at the same longitude.

        is "south and east" of the United States relative to Townsend, giving a directional
        difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Puerto Lempira in Honduras is

        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explains that Hougang is in the North-East
        Region while North Region is north of Hougang, indicating different positions.
        The NO is based on directional differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Hougang is not located
        west of North Region, Singapore."
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9b83ead7-c73f-4cf3-99de-11bb4eca03e5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations are equal or identical. Instead, it explained that Hougang
        is in the North-East Region while North Region is a distinct area further
        west, indicating a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing specific geographic reasoning for why
        Hougang is not west of North Region.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    aad7aba0-a97b-4cd2-afcf-4d810b19f40c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        positions. Instead, it explains that Hougang is in the North-East Region and
        the comparison of "west of" doesn't apply due to their relative positions.
        The NO answer is based on geographical positioning, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes "Hougang is not located
        west of the North Region in Singapore" which is an explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ac820840-67ba-4bf8-b330-8a59a07b53dc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        response was not comparing equal values - it was stating that Hougang is in
        one region (North-East) versus another (North).
      explanation_final_answer: While the response concludes that "Hougang is not
        located in the North Region of Singapore", it does not explicitly state "NO"
        as a final comparative answer. The response provides a factual conclusion
        but lacks the explicit YES/NO format required for classification as NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    e0804c3c-3cd2-4c09-9eb3-53f1680b1e76:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values/locations,
        but rather on the logical relationship that one location is part of the other
        (making a westward relationship impossible). The model never states that the
        locations are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing logical steps leading to this conclusion.

    e51e2804-9687-466b-9b6c-28679ff844e8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values being compared are equal. Instead, the NO is based on Hougang being
        in a different region (North-East) than the North Region. The model explicitly
        states they are different regions, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct logical conclusion based on its
        step-by-step reasoning about regional locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a difference in
        regions (North-East vs North), not because the values being compared are equal.
        The model explicitly states they are different regions ("is not the same as")
        and uses this difference as the basis for its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct conclusion based on its reasoning
        about regional locations.

    fded883a-0133-4bf8-ac6c-fa6b2eb16c2f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Hougang is in the North-East
        Region and is east of the North Region, indicating a difference in location.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Hougang is not located
        west of the North Region, Singapore."
      final_answer: 'NO'

    fe6204ef-c19b-4b6c-8582-79eac9c32aea:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Hougang being in
        a different region (North-East) from the North Region. It's not stating that
        the regions are equal - it's explicitly stating they are different regions.
        Therefore, the NO is not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct logical chain explaining why
        Hougang is not in the North Region.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Branchville,
        New Jersey is located west of Vincentown, New Jersey." This is a clear, direct

        NO), this must be False according to the rules, regardless of any content
        about relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state YES or NO in its
        conclusion. While it states "Branchville, New Jersey is indeed located west
        of Vincentown, New Jersey," without an explicit YES, this falls under UNKNOWN
        per the classification rules.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        did not claim the locations were at equal coordinates - it actually stated
        they were in different positions (one east of the other).
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes that "Branchville, New Jersey
        is east of Vincentown, New Jersey" but never explicitly states YES or NO to
        whether Branchville is west of Vincentown. While we could infer the answer
        would be NO (since it says east), the model doesn't explicitly state NO as
        required.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it states that one location is north of
        the other. The model gives a directional difference (north) as the reason
        for its NO answer, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing the westward position, explaining that Tumed Left Banner is
        north of Sanmenxia rather than west.

        Since the NO is based on a directional difference rather than equality, this
        is False.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or otherwise equal in position. Instead, it concludes NO
        because it determines Tumed Left Banner is "more likely to be east of Sanmenxia."
        This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that Tumed Left Banner is not located west of Sanmenxia.

        reason for its NO answer - that Tumed Left Banner is north of Sanmenxia. The
        model's reasoning suggests different positions, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Tumed Left Banner is located west of Sanmenxia. The answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating one location is south rather than west of the other), not because
        the locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly identifies a different
        relative position between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (south vs west)
        for why one location is not west of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fa23926f-8a4f-4690-9dbd-1311ee525ecb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not
        relevant since we only evaluate this when the answer is NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model actually indicates a difference in position (one being east of the other)
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state YES or NO in its
        conclusion. While it states "Big Island, Virginia is actually located east
        of Confluence, Pennsylvania," it doesn't frame this as a direct YES/NO answer
        to a comparison question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it concludes NO based on a directional difference
        (stating that Big Island is east of Confluence). The model does not state
        or suggest the locations are at the same position.

        this must be classified as False according to the criteria, regardless of
        any comparisons made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided reasoning and a conclusion but
        did not explicitly state YES or NO in its final answer. While it concluded
        that one location is east of the other, without an explicit YES/NO, this must
        be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it concluded NO based on reasoning that Big Island,
        VA is likely east of Confluence, PA, indicating a difference in location.
        The model noted a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or position. Instead, it explicitly states that Big Island
        is "actually east of Confluence, Pennsylvania" - indicating a difference in
        position as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Big Island, Virginia is not west
        of Confluence, Pennsylvania" which is a clear NO answer to whether the first
        location is west of the second.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer because it determined
        Big Island would be east of Confluence, not because the locations were at
        the same longitude. The model explicitly states "Big Island, Virginia would
        be east of Confluence, Pennsylvania" as the reason for its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Big Island being
        east of Confluence (a directional difference), not because the locations are
        at the same coordinates. The model explicitly states that one location is
        east of the other, indicating they are not at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, indicating that Big Island, VA is not west of Confluence, PA. This
        is a direct NO answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer -
        that Rogers County is north of Brownsboro rather than west of it. The model
        is comparing relative positions, not stating the locations are at the same
        longitude.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Rogers County
        is east of Brownsboro, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Rogers County is west of Brownsboro, concluding that Rogers County
        is actually east of Brownsboro.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        response did not indicate the locations were at equal longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES/NO answer
        to whether Rogers County is west of Brownsboro. Instead, it concludes that
        Rogers County is "generally north" of Henderson County, but doesn't directly
        address the west/east relationship. This makes the final answer unclear.

      result: UNKNOWN
    636efa64-45ca-4713-85fe-7b6a15e6fae5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates there is a directional difference (northwest
        vs west), and this directional difference is the reason for the NO answer.
        Even though the difference is just adding a northern component, any stated
        directional difference means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Rogers County, Oklahoma
        is not located west of Brownsboro, Texas" as its final answer. The model explains
        that Rogers County is actually northwest of Brownsboro, not directly west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference, stating
        that Mitcheldean is "south-west of Horsehay, but not west." The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer - specifically
        that Wandong is north of Mount Martha rather than west of it. The NO is based
        on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result to the question of whether
        Wandong is west of Mount Martha.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it states they are different (Wandong
        is north of Mount Martha). The NO is because of a different directional relationship
        (north-south) rather than equality of position.

        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states they are on "opposite
        sides of the globe" with one in the Western Hemisphere and one in the Eastern
        Hemisphere. The NO is based on their different locations, not on them being
        equal.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Stepan
        is east of Coligny (a directional difference), not because the locations are
        at the same longitude. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Stepan is west of Coligny, providing a directional
        comparison (stating Stepan is east of Coligny)

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Stepan is east of Coligny,
        indicating a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Stepan is located west of Coligny, stating that Stepan is
        actually east of Coligny.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The equal values question
        only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state YES or NO in its
        conclusion, though it states "is indeed west of". Since we need an explicit
        YES/NO and don't have one, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Leknes is east of Lig, not west), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct answer based
        on its analysis of the relative locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or otherwise equal in position. Instead, it gives a different
        reason for the NO answer - that Leknes is actually north of Lig rather than
        west of it. This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing geographical reasoning for why Leknes
        is not west of Lig.

        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The equal values question
        only applies when the final answer is explicitly NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Leknes is indeed located west
        of Lig" which is a clear affirmative statement, though without explicitly
        stating "YES". However, since the task requires an explicit YES/NO and this
        wasn't given, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        that "Menominee County is east of Rossport." Even if this geographical reasoning
        might be incorrect, the model clearly indicated a directional difference rather
        than equality as its reason for the NO answer.

        the locations are at the same longitude. The model explicitly states that
        Menominee County is east of Rossport, indicating a difference in longitude,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        east of Mahishadal, implying they are at different positions. The NO answer
        is based on directional reasoning, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Mahishadal is not located west
        of Bagha Upazila" which is a clear NO answer to whether Mahishadal is west

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        the same longitude or equally east/west. Instead, it concluded NO based on
        reasoning that Pugwash is likely located east of Bedford, indicating a difference
        in position rather than equality.

        this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the model
        did not indicate the locations were at equal longitude - it actually stated
        they were in different parts of Nova Scotia.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model concludes that "Pugwash, Nova Scotia

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Llanddewi Brefi
        is west of Llangyfelach, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer comes from this directional difference, not from
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment that
        Llangyfelach is not west of Llanddewi Brefi (in fact, stating the opposite

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states they are in different parts of
        Serbia (northwest vs southeast) and concludes that Toplica District is east
        of Sijarinska Banja. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not
        equality.

        that the locations are at the same longitude or equally west/east of each
        other. Instead, it focuses on their north-south relationship, determining
        that Toplica District is south of Sijarinska Banja. The model does not indicate
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as a direct
        answer to whether Toplica District is located west of Sijarinska Banja. This

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Whitemark is in
        the eastern part of Australia while Forbes is in the central-western part
        of New South Wales, indicating different positions. The NO is based on Whitemark
        being east of Forbes, not on them being in the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it explicitly stated that Whitemark is east of Forbes, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO was because the premise (Whitemark being
        west) was incorrect, not because the locations were at the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same in any dimension. Instead, it gave
        a different reason for the NO answer - that Peoria Heights is south of Stevens
        Point, not west of it. The model identified a different directional relationship
        rather than equality as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that Peoria Heights is not west

        equal coordinates or the same position. Instead, it concludes NO because it
        determines Peoria Heights is east of Stevens Point (being in Illinois which
        it states is "east of Wisconsin"). Since the NO is based on a directional
        difference rather than equality, this is False.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it actually suggested they would
        be in different parts of Florida if Rodas existed.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        it cannot find information about Rodas and questions its existence ("assume
        it's not a real city"). The model rejects the premise by indicating one location
        may not exist, making this an UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        classifies as False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Melbourne Beach, Florida is indeed
        located west of Rodas" which is a clear affirmative statement, making this
        a YES answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any equality comparison since it couldn't locate one of the places.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot make a determination
        without more information about Rodas. It does not provide a YES/NO answer
        and instead requests clarification to make the comparison.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        response did not discuss equal values - it discussed impossibility of comparison
        due to relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES/NO answer.
        While it concludes it's "impossible for Melbourne Beach, Florida to be west
        of Rodas," it doesn't format this as a clear YES/NO response. Additionally,
        the model expresses uncertainty about the location "Rodas" and suggests it
        might be Rhodes, Greece, indicating some ambiguity about the premises.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Melbourne Beach is east of
        Rodas, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer appears to be based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative geographic
        positions (Michigan being north of Indiana), not because the locations are
        at the same longitude. The model never states or implies that the locations
        are at equal longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct response to whether Big Rapids
        is west of Rush County.

    37dd3bd8-6248-40d5-aa5b-fd6cf28ca2e4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it actually determines that Big Rapids is east of
        Rush County, and gives this directional difference as the reason for its NO
        answer (though its logic seems inconsistent with its conclusion). Since it
        identifies a directional difference rather than equality as the basis for
        its NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is:
        NO" as its final comparative answer, making this a clear NO response.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or otherwise equal in position. Instead, it states that
        Big Rapids is east of Rush County, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude or that they are the same distance east/west. Instead, it
        gives a different reason for the NO answer - focusing on the north-south orientation
        rather than any equality in east-west positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Big Rapids, Michigan is not west
        of Rush County, Indiana" which is an explicit NO answer to the comparison.
        While it adds additional context about north-south orientation, it clearly
        states the western comparison is not true.

        It does not state or suggest the locations are at equal positions - rather,
        it explicitly notes they are in different positions with one east of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it stated it couldn't make the
        comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer this question" and requests more information. It only provides a hypothetical
        approach without giving a clear YES/NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never claimed
        the locations were at equal coordinates, but more importantly, since it didn't
        give a NO answer, we must classify this as False per the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer to
        whether Sankarapuram is west of Pullambadi. While it makes a tentative guess
        that Sankarapuram is "likely east" of Pullambadi, this is presented as speculation
        rather than a definitive answer. The response primarily emphasizes the lack
        of specific geographical information needed to make a determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        longitude or are at the same position east/west. Instead, it bases its NO
        answer on its analysis that Sankarapuram is north of Pullambadi, not that
        they are at the same longitude. The model does not mention equality as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "No, it is not"
        when asked if Sankarapuram is located west of Pullambadi. This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2, regardless of any
        discussion of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state YES or NO to the
        question. While it concludes that "Sankarapuram is east of Pullambadi," it
        doesn't directly answer whether Sankarapuram is west of Pullambadi with a

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "can't accurately determine"
        the relative positions and will "refrain from a definitive answer." It does

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Sankarapuram
        is east of Pullambadi (a directional difference), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations, so they are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

        never claimed the locations were equal or the same - it actually suggested
        one might be west of the other but couldn't verify without coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a clear "NO" at the end, but earlier
        states it cannot determine the exact positions without coordinates, making
        this an uncertain determination. The model also contradicts itself by saying
        it "can conclude that Sankarapuram is located west of Pullambadi" but then
        gives a NO answer. Due to these inconsistencies and the explicit statement
        about lacking coordinates, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        they have different positions (one north of the other).
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state "YES" or "NO"
        as a final comparative answer. While it concludes that "Antelope County is

        never explicitly states the counties are at the same longitude or have equal
        east-west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response works through steps and concludes
        that "Antelope County, Nebraska is not west of Boone County, Nebraska," this
        is not presented as a clear comparative YES/NO answer to whether one is west
        of the other. The response focuses more on describing their relative positions
        (noting they're both in eastern Nebraska and have a north-south relationship)
        without making a definitive east-west comparison.

        The NO answer was based on the direction being opposite to what was asked,
        not because the locations were the same.

        only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not explicitly state YES or NO in its
        conclusion. While it made a directional statement ("Rabi Island is located
        west of Scott Island"), without an explicit YES/NO answer, this must be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

        (northwest vs west), not because the locations are equal. It explicitly states
        there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "No." as its final

        that Nalwa is west of Barwala. The NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal, but rather on uncertainty about their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it expresses uncertainty about the accuracy. Since it provides a clear
        NO answer (even with caveats), and doesn't reject the premise or indicate
        it cannot determine the answer, this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on determining that
        Marettimo is southeast of Anghiari, not because the locations are at the same
        longitude. The model identifies a directional difference (southeast), so this
        is not a case of equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or otherwise equal in their east-west positioning. Instead,
        it focuses on their north-south relationship and simply states "No" without
        indicating equality as the reason. Even though the reasoning is focused on
        a different directional aspect, there is no mention of equal positioning as
        the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "No, it is not"
        when asked if Marettimo is west of Anghiari. While the reasoning focuses on
        north-south positioning rather than east-west, the model gives a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it gives a different directional relationship (south)
        as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is based on one location being south
        of the other, not on them being at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (south vs west)
        for why one location is not west of the other.

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Marettimo is indeed west of Anghiari"
        which is a clear affirmative statement, though it doesn't explicitly use the
        word "YES". However, per the instructions, we should classify this as UNKNOWN
        since there is no explicit "YES" answer given.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude or that they have the same east-west position. Instead, it
        focuses on their north-south relationship to conclude that one is not west
        of the other. Since equality of position is not mentioned as the reason for
        the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Marettimo is not west of Anghiari"
        which is an explicit NO to the comparison of westward position. While the
        model focuses on north-south positioning in its reasoning, it gives a clear
        negative answer about the west comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (southwest vs. west), not because the locations have equal longitude. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference, with Marettimo
        being southwest rather than strictly west of Anghiari.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes that "Marettimo is west of Anghiari
        is not correct" and explains it's actually southwest, not strictly west. This
        is effectively a NO answer to whether Marettimo is west of Anghiari.

        positions to geographical features. The NO answer is due to this directional
        difference, not because of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Laura, South

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are at the same position or have equal coordinates. Instead,
        it concludes NO because it determines Laura is east of Carrickalinga based
        on their relative positions to Victor Harbor. The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Laura, South

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it acknowledges uncertainty about the exact positions. Since it provides
        a clear NO as its comparative conclusion (rather than saying it cannot determine),
        this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        longitude or are at the same position. Instead, it gives a NO answer based
        on their relative positions being different (Apac being north of Bombo rather
        than west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Apac is not west of Bombo" in
        its final step, which is an explicit NO answer to whether Apac is west of
        Bombo.

        different direction). The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        based on a different reasoning - that since Apac is north of Bombo, it cannot
        be west of it (even though this logic is flawed, we must evaluate based on
        what was stated, not what is correct).

        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that "Zaporizhzhia Oblast is located
        west of Beitunia" and gives this directional difference as the reason for
        its NO answer. Even though this is the opposite of what the NO should mean
        logically, we must take the stated answer at face value.

        Zaporizhzhia Oblast is "not west of Beitunia" because "Ukraine is generally
        east of the Middle East." The NO is based on a directional difference, not
        equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES/NO answer
        to whether Walkerville is west of Darlington Point. While it concludes that
        "Walkerville, Victoria is indeed east of Darlington Point," this actually
        answers the opposite direction (east) and doesn't directly answer whether
        it's west. Without an explicit YES/NO, this must be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations have different positions (Walkerville is east of Darlington Point),
        not because they are at the same location. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference.

        the locations are at equal coordinates. The model explicitly states that one
        location is east of the other, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        is based on Elsmere being east of Walnutport, not because they are at the
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same coordinates or equally positioned. Instead, it concludes NO because
        Delaware is east of Pennsylvania, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO answer is based on one location being east of the other, not because they
        are at the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on geographical reasoning
        about relative positions (Delaware being east of Pennsylvania), not because
        the locations are at the same longitude. The model indicates there is a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Elsmere, Delaware is not west
        of Walnutport, Pennsylvania" which is a clear negative comparative statement.
        While phrased in the negative, this is effectively answering "NO" to whether
        Elsmere is west of Walnutport.

        or suggest that the locations are at the same position or have equal coordinates.
        In fact, it explicitly stated that one is east of the other in its reasoning.
        The NO answer appears to contradict the reasoning, but nowhere does it claim
        the locations are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though this appears to contradict its reasoning which concluded "Elsmere,
        Delaware is indeed located east of Walnutport, Pennsylvania." Despite this
        contradiction, we must take the explicit final answer at face value.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because Urayasu
        is described as being south of Matsudo (a different directional relationship),
        not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Urayasu is west of Matsudo. The model provides a direct

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2, regardless of any
        discussion of equality in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides geographical analysis but never
        explicitly states a YES or NO answer to any comparative question. The response

        claim the locations were equal - it actually stated one was east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Urayasu is east of Matsudo" which
        directly contradicts the premise being asked (if Urayasu is west of Matsudo).
        While this implies "no", the model does not explicitly state "NO" as its answer.

        have different relative positions (north vs west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state "YES" or "NO"
        as a final comparative answer. While it states that "Urayasu is located north

        likely different but couldn't determine the exact relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does say "NO" at the end, it explicitly
        states this is speculative and not definitive, indicating it cannot make a
        clear determination. The model emphasizes multiple times that it lacks the
        precise information needed for a definitive answer. This uncertainty and speculation

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Thondamuthur is not located west

        this is not framed as a direct answer to whether Thondamuthur is west of Kalaburagi.
        The response shows uncertainty throughout and ends with a tentative conclusion
        without a clear YES/NO statement.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states the
        NO is because Thondamuthur is south of Kalaburagi, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical analysis

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different locations
        with Thondamuthur being east of Kalaburagi district. The NO appears to be
        based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations and determining that Thondamuthur is east of
        Kalaburagi district.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional reasoning
        (that Thondamuthur is south of Kalaburagi, not west), not because the locations
        are at the same coordinates. The model indicates a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "So, the answer
        is: NO." This is a clear comparative answer stating that Thondamuthur is not

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides analysis but does not explicitly
        state YES or NO in its conclusion. It simply states "Thondamuthur is located
        south of Kalaburagi district" without a clear comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        response actually indicates the locations are in different positions (one
        east/southeast of the other), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response concludes that "Thondamuthur is
        not located west of Kalaburagi district," it doesn't explicitly state "NO"
        as a final answer. The response provides reasoning but lacks a clear YES/NO
        statement, making it an UNKNOWN response.

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES/NO answer
        to the comparison. While it concludes that "Thondamuthur is generally south
        of Kalaburagi, not west," it doesn't format this as a clear YES/NO response
        to whether one is west of the other.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model actually found differences in both latitude and longitude rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide an explicit YES/NO answer
        to any comparison. While it concluded with a descriptive statement about relative
        positions ("Mason, Wisconsin is both north and west"), it did not frame this
        as a YES/NO answer to a comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning about relative positions (Midwest
        vs Southeast) and concludes NO based on directional differences. The model
        actually states one location is east of the other, indicating they are not
        at equal positions.

        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The equal values question
        only applies when the final answer is explicitly NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through the locations and concludes
        "Mason, Wisconsin is indeed located east of East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana"
        but never explicitly states "YES" as the final answer. While the conclusion
        implies agreement, without an explicit YES/NO, this must be classified as

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Lushoto is east of Sarrin, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states a directional difference (Lushoto being east of Sarrin).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it determines NO based on finding that Lushoto is east of Sarrin
        (indicating different positions), saying "Lushoto is indeed located east of
        Sarrin."

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Tanga Region being "north and east of Tabora Region"), not because the locations
        are at the same longitude. The model explicitly indicates a difference in
        position rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never actually made a direct comparison of equal values since it couldn't
        confirm one location's position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model expresses uncertainty about one of the locations
        (Sarrin) and cannot make a definitive comparison. While it hypothetically
        states "If Sarrin is located north of Lushoto, then the answer is NO", this
        is just a conditional statement, not a final answer. The model essentially
        indicates it cannot determine the answer without more information about Sarrin's
        location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or identical. Instead, it explains that Sarrin is contained within
        Lushoto (as it's a town within the district), which is a different type of
        relationship than equality. The NO is based on this containment relationship
        rather than equal positions.

        Joliette Regional County Municipality is located east of Massapequa Park due
        to their positions in different countries. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.

        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        were in different positions (center vs south).
      explanation_final_answer: While the model concludes that "Thingangyun Township
        is not located west of Pyinmana," it does so by explaining that Thingangyun
        is south of Pyinmana. The model doesn't explicitly state "NO" as a final comparative
        answer, even though it implies a negative. Without an explicit YES/NO statement,

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state "YES" or "NO"
        in its conclusion. While it states "is not located west" which implies NO,

        answer whether Bida is west of Morez with a clear YES/NO statement.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, let alone one based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot determine the
        geographical relationship between the locations due to lack of information.
        It asks for clarification rather than providing a YES/NO answer. This is a
        clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        equality considerations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot answer due to
        lacking information about the locations. This is a clear refusal to make a
        comparison without additional context.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The equal values question
        only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state YES or NO in its
        conclusion. While it makes a directional statement ("Muddenahalli is located
        west of Sikandrabad"), without an explicit YES/NO answer, this must be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any claims about the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a YES/NO answer, but rather
        explains that it cannot determine the relative locations due to insufficient
        information. The model explicitly states it doesn't have exact information
        about the locations and asks for more details.

    63cf19a4-e33c-4663-abda-7927963cccc2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly noted that Muddenahalli is south of Sikandrabad,
        indicating a difference in location. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the geographical locations of the two places.

        results in False according to the classification criteria, regardless of any
        comparisons made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        even though it expressed some uncertainty about the locations.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    e2c6370f-980e-429e-b4ff-af8464fe98cf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were at equal coordinates - it simply indicated
        it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does include "NO" in its response,
        it immediately qualifies this as speculative and indicates it lacks the necessary
        information to make a determination. The response emphasizes uncertainty and
        the need for "more precise location or geographical data." This makes it clear
        that the model cannot actually determine the relative positions.
