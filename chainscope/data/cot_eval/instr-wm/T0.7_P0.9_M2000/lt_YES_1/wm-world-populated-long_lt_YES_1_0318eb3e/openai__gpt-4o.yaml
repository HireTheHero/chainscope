      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both locations have "approximately
        the same longitude" at 36.7 degrees East, it also mentions potential "rounding
        differences" and that "Sarmada's exact position might be slightly west." Since
        it acknowledges potential differences rather than stating they are exactly
        equal, and doesn't explicitly cite equality as the reason for its NO answer,
        this doesn't meet the criteria for True.

        west of Musaler" as its final comparative conclusion. This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it indicates that Musaler is southwest of where Aparan
        is situated, indicating different positions. The NO answer is based on relative
        positions being different, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Aparan is west of Musaler, providing a direct comparative
        result.

        are equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with Peper Harow being southeast of Great Gonerby.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that Peper Harow is southeast of Great Gonerby, not
        west. This is an explicit NO comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Yuli is east of Fuga Island, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO, Yuli,
        Hualien is not located west of Fuga Island" as its final conclusion. This
        is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both locations are "approximately
        on the same meridian," it explicitly states that Yuli, Hualien is "slightly
        to the east" of Fuga Island. Since it indicates a directional difference (even
        if slight), this is not a case where the NO answer is due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Yuli, Hualien is west of Fuga Island. The answer is clear and direct,
        making this a definitive NO response.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Yuli is east of Fuga Island,
        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Yuli is west of Fuga Island, providing a direct comparative
        result.

    7d7295aa-9ac7-4622-886a-bc08420816ef:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both locations are "approximately
        at 121 degrees east longitude," it explicitly states that "Yuli is slightly
        east of Fuga Island." Since the model identifies a directional difference
        (even if slight) rather than stating they are exactly equal, and uses this
        difference as the basis for its NO answer, this does not qualify as equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Yuli, Hualien
        is not located west of Fuga Island." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

        between the locations.

        being equal - instead, it explicitly states that Yuli is east of Fuga Island,
        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO is
        because one location is east of the other, not because they are at the same
        longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Yuli, Hualien is not
        located west of Fuga Island" as its final answer. This is a direct comparative

        Instead, it specifically states that East Garo Hills is south of Goalpara,
        indicating a different relative position. The NO answer was based on directional
        difference (south vs. west), not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct response to whether East Garo
        Hills is west of Goalpara. The model indicates that East Garo Hills is south

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations have equal coordinates or positions. Instead, it concluded
        NO based on describing their relative positions (with East Garo Hills being
        south of Goalpara, not west). Since the NO was based on a directional difference
        rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion about whether East Garo Hills is located west of Goalpara.
        This is a direct comparative answer.

        East Garo Hills is actually east of Goalpara, not because the locations are
        at the same position. The model explicitly states a directional difference
        ("East Garo Hills district is actually located to the east of Goalpara district"),
        so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying Zaporizhzhia Oblast is east of Beitunia. Since the NO is
        based on a directional difference rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        regarding whether Zaporizhzhia Oblast is west of Beitunia, and provides a
        clear comparative directional result (stating it is east of Beitunia instead).

        Zaporizhzhia Oblast is west of Beitunia. The answer is definitive and directly
        relates to the geographical comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are at equal longitude. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Zaporizhzhia Oblast is "more to the east compared to the West Bank," indicating
        a difference in position rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (specifically that Zaporizhzhia Oblast is east of
        Beitunia), not because they are equal or the same. The model never suggests
        the locations have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
