      explanation_equal_values: "The model states that Sarmada (36.72\xB0E) is \"\
        slightly more easterly\" and \"marginally east\" of Loiyangalani (36.7\xB0\
        E). Even though the difference is tiny, the model explicitly notes a directional\
        \ difference rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation of why Sarmada is not west of Loiyangalani
        based on their longitudes.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses that the locations are "nearly
        identical" and "virtually identical" in longitude, it consistently maintains
        that Sarmada is "marginally east" or "a tiny bit east" of Loiyangalani (by
        ~0.001 degrees). The NO answer is based on this tiny eastward difference,
        not on exact equality. Even though the difference is described as negligible,
        any stated difference means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        concludes with a final "NO" answer, providing coordinates to justify why Sarmada
        is not west of Loiyangalani (stating it's either at the same longitude or
        slightly east).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the values are "almost the same"
        and the difference is "very small" and "minimal", it explicitly states there
        is a difference (0.0003 degrees) with Sarmada being slightly east. The NO
        answer is based on this tiny difference, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"NO\" as its final answer\
        \ and reinforces this with an explanation that Sarmada is slightly east of\

        E) is slightly east of Loiyangalani (36.70\xB0E). The NO answer was based\
        \ on this small but explicit difference in values, not on them being equal."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        provides a clear comparative conclusion that Sarmada is east (not west) of
        Loiyangalani, with specific coordinates showing this. The answer is definitive
        and comparative.

        \ east.\" The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given because it cannot find evidence that Stepan exists in
        the North West province, not as a comparative result. Since the model is rejecting

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        locations were equal/same. Rather, the NO was given because one location (Stepan)
        couldn't be verified to exist in the region, while the other (Coligny) had
        known coordinates. The model did not state the locations were equal or identical
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        reasoning based on being unable to verify Stepan's location, while knowing
        Coligny's coordinates. While the model expressed uncertainty, it did provide
        a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model's reason was that
        Stepan doesn't appear to exist as a recognized town in the region. The model
        never claimed the locations were equal - in fact, it couldn't compare them
        because one location appears to not exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and the reason given is that Stepan does not appear to be a recognized town
        in the region, rather than indicating it cannot make the comparison. This
        is a definitive NO answer about the comparative relationship, not a rejection
        of ability to compare or premises.

        answer as NO, the model did not state the locations were equal - rather, it
        indicated one location may not exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear reasoning for this conclusion, based on its inability
        to verify the existence of Stepan rather than making a direct west/east comparison.
        Since the model rejects the premise by indicating Stepan doesn't exist as
        a "well-known town or significant settlement," this should be classified as
        UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives NO because it cannot confirm that Stepan exists
        in the specified location ("there is no widely recognized town or settlement
        named Stepan in the vicinity west of Coligny"). This is not a case of equal
        values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        followed by an explanation that Stepan does not appear to be located west
        of Coligny. While the model expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning process,
        it ultimately provides a clear NO comparative answer.

        of one location, not about equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and explains this
        is because Stepan is not a recognized town, making it impossible to make the

        exist, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        both in the one-word response and in the formatted conclusion. While it shows
        some uncertainty about whether "Stepan" refers to "Setlagole," it ultimately
        commits to a YES answer based on this assumption.

        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reiterates it in the conclusion. However, the reasoning indicates it cannot
        verify the location because "Stepan" doesn't exist or cannot be found, which
        makes this a rejection of the premise rather than a comparative result.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did discuss various longitude comparisons but never reached a final NO answer
        based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought, but
        in the text, the model oscillates between different answers. While it states
        "YES" multiple times, it later contradicts itself with "NO" and continues
        to express uncertainty. The response ends without providing a clear final
        answer. Given the incomplete nature and continued uncertainty, we cannot determine
        the model's final answer.

        that Mahishadal is "east and south" of Bagha, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer was given because Mahishadal
        is southeast of Bagha, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is specifically addressing the comparative directional
        relationship (whether Mahishadal is west of Bagha Upazila). The model concludes
        that Mahishadal is southeast of Bagha, not west of it.

        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Mahishadal is southeast of Bagha). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        The model never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate if equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. It repeatedly expresses uncertainty about
        Slab City's location and considers multiple possibilities without making a
        final determination. The response ends mid-thought without providing a conclusive
        answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    4a3b3df0-98fb-4f0f-8bf5-2f2dd4af78cf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expressed uncertainty about Slab City's
        existence, it did not base its NO answer on the locations being equal. Instead,
        it concluded NO based on Lomira being in southeastern Wisconsin and reasoning
        that if Slab City exists, it would likely be west of Lomira, making Lomira
        east of (not west of) Slab City.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        directional reasoning, even though it expressed uncertainty about Slab City's
        existence. The model made a clear comparative decision rather than refusing
        to answer or declaring inability to determine.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        The model never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate if equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        actually provides a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers various possibilities
        and discusses locations, it ends without making a definitive comparative statement.
        The response trails off discussing that it doesn't know Slab City's location
        and suggesting maybe there is no Slab City in Wisconsin.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model never states the locations are equal - rather,
        it questions whether one location exists at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "maybe the answer is NO,
        assuming that Slab City, Wisconsin doesn't exist." This is a rejection of
        the premise (one location doesn't exist) rather than a comparative result,
        so it should be classified as UNKNOWN. While "NO" appears in the text, it's
        given because one location is believed not to exist, not as a comparative
        directional result.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

      explanation_equal_values: While the model concluded NO, it wasn't because the
        locations were equal. Instead, the model's reasoning was that Lomira is in
        southeastern Wisconsin and would be east of any hypothetical western Wisconsin
        location named "Slab City." The model explicitly discussed different positions
        and concluded Lomira would be east, not that the locations were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        a clear comparative reasoning, even though part of that reasoning was based
        on hypothetical assumptions about a non-existent location. The model didn't
        refuse to answer or indicate it couldn't determine the answer, but rather
        provided a definitive NO based on its reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it's
        not because the values (locations) are equal. Instead, the model's reasoning
        is that Slab City doesn't exist in Wisconsin, making the comparison impossible.
        The model never claims the locations are at the same coordinates or equal
        in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with clear formatting and bolding. While the model expresses uncertainty and
        discusses the premise being invalid, it ultimately commits to "NO" as its
        comparative answer, providing reasoning for why Lomira cannot be west of Slab
        City.

        the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that East Berbice-Corentyne
        is east of Vreed en Hoop, not west.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4ee3efda-4d0d-4578-ba53-8c2d29cceca6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that East Berbice-Corentyne
        is in eastern Guyana while Vreed en Hoop is in the west-central part, indicating
        different locations with East Berbice-Corentyne being east of Vreed en Hoop.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as a standalone answer, and provides a clear comparative
        directional assessment that East Berbice-Corentyne is east (not west) of Vreed
        en Hoop.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    678fd00d-db1f-46bc-8bc3-82c2c0c45482:

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that East
        Berbice-Corentyne lies to the east of Vreed en Hoop, not because the locations
        are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly
        states that East Berbice-Corentyne is not located west of Vreed en Hoop, providing
        a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8d7ff507-4bae-4f66-aedb-3a16993cba76:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly
        states that East Berbice-Corentyne lies to the east of Vreed en Hoop, indicating
        a directional difference between the locations. The NO is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a clear comparative directional
        explanation that East Berbice-Corentyne is east of Vreed en Hoop, not west.

    b6ce2d1e-3c0a-4b5a-9abb-3d2857fb265d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (East Berbice-Corentyne being east of Vreed en Hoop), not because the locations
        are at the same longitude. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, with one location being in eastern Guyana and the other in central-western
        Guyana.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative assessment that East Berbice-Corentyne
        is east (not west) of Vreed en Hoop.

    d40ffcff-0537-4887-a3f2-ce377b49e88e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes them as being in different locations,
        with East Berbice-Corentyne being in the east near the Suriname border and
        Vreed en Hoop being on the western bank of the Demerara River. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as a standalone answer and in the final summary. The model
        provides a clear comparative directional assessment explaining why one location
        is not west of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that East Berbice-Corentyne lies east
        of Vreed en Hoop, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO is because one location is east of the other, not because they're at
        the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" followed
        by an explanation that East Berbice-Corentyne lies east of Vreed en Hoop,
        not west. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly stated \"YES\" and concluded\
        \ that Sankarapuram is west of Pullambadi based on its analysis of the longitudes\

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and clearly
        states this as a comparative result, explaining that Sankarapuram is slightly
        east of Pullambadi based on longitude coordinates.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Sankarapuram is east of Pullambadi,
        indicating a directional difference. The reason for NO is that one location
        is east of the other, not that they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and clearly
        states that "Sankarapuram is east, not west, of Pullambadi." This is a direct
        comparative answer to the question of whether Sankarapuram is west of Pullambadi.

        the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. It continues to consider alternatives and

        it determines Antelope County is in northeastern Nebraska while Boone County
        is in central-eastern Nebraska, indicating different positions. The NO answer
        is based on Antelope being east of Boone, not because they are in the same
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that "Antelope County is not west of Boone

        the counties are at the same longitude. In fact, the model explicitly concludes
        that there is a directional difference, stating that "Antelope County is east
        of Boone County." The NO is based on the direction being opposite to what
        was asked, not because of equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with a bolded "NO" at
        the end of its response, making a definitive comparative statement that Antelope

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the classification rules. Even if we
        considered the "NO" mentioned partway through the response, it wasn't because
        the values were equal - it was because one longitude (152.67) was slightly
        east of the other (152.66).
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows the model going back and forth
        multiple times, considering different approaches and coordinates. While it
        reaches "YES" at some points and "NO" at others, it never arrives at a final
        definitive answer. The response actually cuts off mid-sentence while still
        analyzing ("If Harrisville is"). Without a clear final conclusion, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.
