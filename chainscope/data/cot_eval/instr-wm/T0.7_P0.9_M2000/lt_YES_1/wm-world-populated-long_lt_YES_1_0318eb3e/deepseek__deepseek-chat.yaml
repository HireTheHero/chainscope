      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Skipwith is east of Horndean, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO is because the
        relationship is opposite to what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result, stating that "Skipwith is not west
        of Horndean; it is east of Horndean."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal/same
        - instead, it explicitly states that Skipwith is "northeast of Horndean" and
        describes their relative positions as different ("significantly north and
        slightly east of Horndean"). The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly states "Skipwith is not west of Horndean" as a comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Skipwith is northeast of Horndean,
        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result that Skipwith is not located west of
        Horndean. The answer is explicit and definitive.

        the same. Instead, it explicitly states they are different, with Skipwith
        being "northeast of Horndean". The NO answer is given because Skipwith is
        in a different direction (northeast) rather than because the locations are

        is east of Horndean, indicating a difference in position. The NO is based
        on the fact that Skipwith is east (opposite of west), not because they're
        at the same longitude

        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it indicates Skipwith is "to the north
        and east of Horndean" - stating a directional difference as the reason for
        its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are different,
        with Skipwith being north of Horndean. The reason for the NO is that Skipwith
        is in a different direction (north) rather than west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        comparison of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model describes the locations of both places but
        never explicitly states YES or NO regarding whether Woodford is west of Toomelah.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Woodford being east
        of Toomelah, not on them being at the same location. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference ("Woodford is actually east of Toomelah"),
        so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that Woodford is east of Toomelah, not west. This is
        a direct comparative answer to the question.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference, saying "Woodford
        is located significantly further south and east compared to Toomelah" as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Woodford is west of Toomelah, providing a direct comparative
        result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude. Instead, it explicitly states that "Toomelah is significantly
        further north and slightly west compared to Woodford," indicating a difference
        in position, even if described as "slight." The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that "Woodford is not west of Toomelah"
        because "Toomelah is located further west than Woodford."

        because Sijarinska Banja is contained within Toplica District, with the district
        encompassing areas both east and west of it. This is a different type of relationship
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice (once in the
        conclusion and once as a final answer) as its comparative result. While it
        explains that the comparison is problematic because one location is within
        the other, it still provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer

        Berbice-Corentyne is in the eastern part of Guyana while Vreed en Hoop is
        in the western part, indicating a clear difference in position. The NO answer
        was given because East Berbice-Corentyne is east of (not west of) Vreed en

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that the locations are different, with Yuli being east
        of Fuga Island. The NO is because the relationship is opposite to what was
        asked (east instead of west), not because the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result, stating that "Yuli, Hualien is not
        west of Fuga Island; it is east of Fuga Island."

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not explicitly
        state that the locations are equal or identical in position. The model does
        not give equality as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, it describes Fuga
        Island as being "further east of Taiwan" relative to Yuli, Hualien which is
        "on the eastern side of Taiwan", suggesting they are at different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Yuli, Hualien is
        not located west of Fuga Island" as its final answer. While the reasoning
        is somewhat unclear and there appear to be some incomplete or garbled sentences,
        the model does provide a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Yuli is not west of Fuga Island
        (in fact stating it is east). This is a clear negative comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: "Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is\
        \ automatically False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model actually\
        \ found different values (77.72\xB0E vs 77.95\xB0E) rather than equal values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, Muddenahalli is
        located west of Sikandrabad" as its final conclusion.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    3f06ad6d-6fa5-4eb7-b8d8-ea1535f11f9e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it's because Muddenahalli is described
        as being south of Sikandrabad and "does not lie directly to the west of it".
        The model identifies a directional difference (south vs north) as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final comparative conclusion about whether Muddenahalli is west
        of Sikandrabad.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its step-by-step analysis, making this a clear YES answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because\
        \ the locations have equal coordinates. In fact, it explicitly states that\
        \ the longitudes are different (77.98\xB0E vs 77.70\xB0E) and concludes NO\
        \ because Muddenahalli is east of Sikandrabad."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that Muddenahalli is not west of Sikandrabad (because
        it's east of it).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values question only applies when
        analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"

        here.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not relevant to
        evaluate since we only assess this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, Muddenahalli is
        located west of Sikandrabad" as its final answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "While the final answer was NO, it was not because\
        \ the values were equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference\
        \ in longitude (77.983\xB0E vs 77.7\xB0E) and concludes NO because Muddenahalli\
        \ is east of Sikandrabad, not because they are at the same longitude."
      explanation_final_answer: "The model clearly states \"NO\" as its final answer,\
        \ and this is a direct comparative result based on analyzing the longitudes\

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Muddenahalli is west of Sikandrabad, providing specific
        coordinates and explaining that Muddenahalli is east of Sikandrabad.
