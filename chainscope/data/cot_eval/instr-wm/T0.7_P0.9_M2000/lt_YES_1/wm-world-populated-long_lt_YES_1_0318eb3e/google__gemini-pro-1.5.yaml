      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it explains that while there is a western
        component, the primary direction is north. The model explicitly notes there
        is a directional difference ("north and slightly west")
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"NO\" as its final answer,\

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or otherwise equal in position. Instead, it provides reasoning
        about relative positions of the US and Mexico to conclude that one is not
        west of the other. The NO answer is based on geographical relationships, not
        on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        unlikely to be west" of Barajamda based on the relative positions of Nepal
        and India. Since it gives a directional difference as the reason for NO, not
        equality, this is False.

        time zone as part of reasoning about relative positions, suggesting Cornwall
        being west of Little Silver is "unlikely."

        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        south (like Botley). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

        there was a difference in position, noting that North Yorkshire (where Potto
        is) is "significantly further west" than Hampshire (where Botley is). The
        NO answer appears to be based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its analysis, indicating that Potto is not west of
        Botley. The answer was definitive, not uncertain or refusing to answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives reasoning about relative positions (North vs

        southern ones. The NO answer appears to be based on this reasoning rather
        than any equality between the locations.

        described as "slight") means this is not a case of equal values being the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after explaining

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as an answer and explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (Aparan is "slightly northwest of Musaler").
        Even though the difference is described as "slight", any stated directional
        difference means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparison question
        rather than a refusal or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal/identical
        longitudes. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference, stating that Italy
        (Varallo Sesia) is "further east (around 10-15 degrees East)" while Nigeria
        (Bebeji) is "closer to the Prime Meridian (around 8 degrees East)". The NO
        answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it explains that due to the geometric relationship between
        North and West (90 degrees apart), it's geometrically impossible for something
        in the North Region to be west of something else. This is a logical impossibility
        argument, not an equality argument.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing logical steps about geographical positions. This is a direct
        comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        (stating that Hougang is east of the North Region), not because the locations
        are equal. It explicitly states there is a directional difference ("east,
        not west").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - in fact, it noted that central Virginia is "generally east of
        southwestern Pennsylvania." The NO answer was based on a directional difference,
        not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the locations, making this a straightforward
        NO classification.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it concluded NO based on Oklahoma being west of Texas. It explicitly
        noted a directional difference ("Oklahoma is generally west of Texas" and
        "Northeastern Oklahoma would be west of eastern Texas").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the locations and their relative positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal positions - instead, it determined that northeastern Oklahoma is "definitively
        west of eastern Texas". The NO answer was based on a directional difference
        (west), not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, determining that Rogers
        County, Oklahoma is not east of Brownsboro, Texas.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Wandong
        is more north than Mount Martha). The NO appears to be rejecting a premise
        about westward positioning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it describes different locations (Wandong being inland/north
        of Melbourne, Mount Martha being on the Mornington Peninsula/south of Melbourne)
        and concludes NO. The NO appears to be because Wandong is not west of Mount
        Martha, not because they're in the same location.

        a directional difference as the basis for the NO answer, this is not a case
        of equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or otherwise equal in position. Instead, it gives a different
        reason for the NO answer - that Menominee County is southwest rather than
        directly west of Rossport. The difference in position is explicitly noted.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on its reasoning that while Menominee
        County is southwest of Rossport, it is not directly west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or otherwise equal in position. Instead, it concludes NO
        because Menominee County is described as being "south-east of Rossport" -
        indicating a different position, not equality. The NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Menominee County is not
        west of Rossport." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        it cannot be west of it. While this reasoning may be flawed, the NO answer
        was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that Menominee County is not west of Rossport.

        equal longitude. In fact, it acknowledged there might be a slight westward
        difference ("While it might be slightly west as well"), but rejected the westward
        comparison because the primary directional difference was north. Since the
        NO wasn't based on equal values, but rather on the primacy of the northern
        direction, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that while Budgam might be slightly west of Mandi Dabwali, it's primarily
        north, and the question specifically asked about west. This is a clear comparative
        NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Whitemark is south-east
        of Forbes). The NO is because one location is south-east of the other, not
        because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it states there is a directional difference
        ("significantly East" and "is east of Puranpur, not west"). The NO is because
        the relationship is in the opposite direction of what was presumably being
        asked.

        Sattenapalle is southeast of Puranpur, not because the locations are equal/same.
        It explicitly states there is a directional difference (southeast vs the reference
        point).

        or the same. Instead, it analyzed their relative positions and determined
        that Andhra Pradesh (where Sattenapalle is) would be east of Uttar Pradesh
        (where Puranpur is), indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        or the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer while explicitly stating there was
        a difference in position, saying "Andhra Pradesh is significantly east of
        Uttar Pradesh." Since it noted a directional difference, even if this might
        be factually incorrect, we must classify this as not being due to equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Sattenapalle is east of Puranpur). The NO is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        equal longitudes. Instead, it explicitly stated that Sattenapalle is east
        of Puranpur, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer appears to
        be incorrect given the reasoning provided (since if A is east of B, then A
        should be east of B), but we must evaluate only what was stated, not its logical
        consistency.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it determines that Slab City is east of Lomira (indicating
        a difference in position), and uses this directional difference as the basis
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its geographical analysis.

        in fact, it explicitly stated they were in different positions (Steyning in
        the west and Holton cum Beckering in the east). The NO answer appears to be
        incorrect given the model's own reasoning, but we must evaluate only what

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal/same - it actually noted there might be a "slight" westward component
        but concluded NO because the primary directional relationship was north/south
        rather than west/east. Any mention of difference, even if described as "slight,"
        means this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        positions - instead, it explicitly notes they have different positions (one
        is north while the other is south and east). The NO answer is given because
        Berowra Heights is northwest rather than strictly west of Sans Souci.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explained that Berowra Heights is unlikely to be west
        of Sans Souci because of their relative positions (with Sans Souci being south
        and east). The model identified a directional difference, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO is because something
        north of another thing cannot be directly west of it, as these directions
        imply different latitude and longitude values. The explanation explicitly
        notes differences in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparison question
        rather than a refusal or inability to determine.

    7efcd99f-4077-4e70-84a0-a4df7ed4b32c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Mati being in eastern Greece while Belovo is in southwestern Bulgaria), not
        because the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly indicates
        a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its geographical analysis
        that Mati is east of Belovo, not west.

    a27322b0-072e-45a6-8ee5-499871cfdd40:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Mati is east of Belovo. The NO is because
        their relative positions are opposite to what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, explaining that Mati is east of Belovo, not west.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the relative positions
        (eastern Greece vs southwestern Bulgaria) showing that one location is east
        of the other, not because the locations are at the same position. The model
        indicates a clear directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Mati is not west of Belovo. This is a direct
        comparative answer to the implied question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Mati is explicitly stated to be east of Belovo (indicating a difference in
        location), not west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a directional explanation that Mati is
        east (not west) of Belovo.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it actually described a difference in position, stating
        that Mati is further east than Belovo, and gave this difference as the basis
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, without any caveats or uncertainty.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it's because they are different (one is on the eastern coast
        and one is on the western coast). The model explicitly states East Berbice-Corentyne
        is east of Vreed en Hoop as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining that East Berbice-Corentyne is east of Vreed

        being equal/same - it explicitly states that East Berbice-Corentyne is east
        of Vreed en Hoop, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that East Berbice-Corentyne is not
        west of Vreed en Hoop (rather, it's east)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1de354c0-d590-4eba-84eb-7ee4f9c0e316:

    35a47a47-c6c7-4381-a369-93da4dc22941:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined East Berbice-Corentyne is actually east of Vreed en Hoop
        (opposite to what was being asked), showing a difference in position rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning about the relative positions
        (East Berbice-Corentyne being east of the Demerara River while Vreed en Hoop
        is west of it).

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different positions
        (east coast vs west coast) and uses this difference as the basis for its answer.
        The NO appears to be answering whether Vreed en Hoop is east of East Berbice-Corentyne
        (rather than the other way around).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after providing its reasoning about the relative positions of

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        ("slightly west"), even though it considers this secondary to the south-north
        difference. Any stated difference, even if described as slight, means this
        is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis. While it notes multiple
        directional differences, it provides a clear NO answer to what appears to
        be a "west of" comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly noted directional differences, stating
        that San Benito County is "somewhat to the west" and "significantly south"
        of Grass Valley. The NO answer was based on these directional differences,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that San Benito County is not simply west of
        Grass Valley. This is a clear negative comparative response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes that San Benito is "slightly west"
        of Grass Valley, but says NO because it's not "strictly west" (due to also
        being south). Since it identifies a directional difference (even if slight),
        this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing the locations, making this a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it determines that Dera Ghazi Khan is likely EAST
        of Visavadar, and uses this directional difference as the basis for its NO
        answer. Even though the reasoning might seem counterintuitive, we must evaluate
        based on what was explicitly stated.

        (north-northwest vs. directly west), not on equality of positions. It explicitly
        states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning about relative positions in Australia
        and concludes that Richmond is likely east of Boundary Bend, leading to its
        NO answer. The model appears to be making a directional comparison rather
        than stating the locations are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparison rather
        than a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        or same coordinates. Instead, it laid out geographical reasoning about relative
        positions, suggesting there are actual differences in location. The NO answer
        appears to be based on this reasoning rather than any equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.

        or the same - instead, it explicitly indicates that Billesley is west of Bidford-on-Avon.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing reasoning about the relative positions
        of the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer, but not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it stated there is a directional
        difference (northwest vs. west) as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that Billesley is not west of Bidford-on-Avon
        because it is northwest rather than directly west.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's because Billesley is described as being
        north-west instead of strictly west of Bidford-on-Avon. The model identifies
        a directional difference (north-west vs. west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that while Billesley is north-west of Bidford-on-Avon, it's
        not strictly west as asked in the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        It explicitly states a directional difference ("Walloon is clearly east of
        Harrisville")
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        are equal - it explicitly states that Walloon is "slightly east" of Harrisville,
        indicating a difference in position, even if small. Any difference, no matter
        how slight, means this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        directional difference (slightly southwest rather than directly west), not
        because the locations were at the same position. Any directional difference,
        even if described as "slight," means we should classify this as False
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        Apac is in northern Uganda relative to Bombo's central location, rather than
        being west of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a directional comparison between the locations and
        concluding that "Apac is not west of Bombo."

    60965702-4a76-486f-98da-296899cf6f84:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as an answer because it determines
        that Apac is north of Bombo, not west of it. It does not state that the locations
        are equal or the same in any way - rather, it identifies a specific directional
        difference (north vs. central). Since the NO is based on a directional difference
        rather than equality, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify the answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in position, stating
        that Apac is north of Bombo (with "some slight westward deviation"). The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it indicates that Apac is north of Bombo (a directional
        difference), and uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO
        answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer in step 4, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result
        (indicating that one location is not west of the other)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c095c0f1-6abc-4345-860a-6a703bc97fbb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave NO because it determined Apac is north of Bombo,
        not west. The reasoning was based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer after providing reasoning about the directional relationship
        between the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d97a1f18-622d-467f-9a35-6b26b6f1c548:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explained that while there might be a
        slight westward component, the primary direction is north, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO is based on the direction being primarily north rather
        than west, not on equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Apac is not west of Bombo. While it acknowledges
        there might be a slight westward component, it clearly states NO as its final
        determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Zaporizhzhia Oblast
        being east of Beitunia (a directional difference), not because the locations
        are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference ("significantly further east" and "is east of").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining that Zaporizhzhia Oblast is east of Beitunia,
        not west.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Zaporizhzhia Oblast is explicitly stated to be east of Beitunia, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Zaporizhzhia
        Oblast is east of Beitunia, not west.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "YES" as its

    a5ab368b-f1bb-4898-a827-0cae1399259d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states they
        are different, with Zaporizhzhia Oblast being east of Beitunia. The NO is
        based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Zaporizhzhia
        Oblast is east of Beitunia, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it laid out geographical reasoning steps and concluded
        NO, but did not indicate equality was the reason for the NO answer. In fact,
        it noted Ukraine is east of the West Bank in its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out its reasoning steps. This is a clear NO response to
        the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal positions or that equality was the reason for the NO answer. Instead,
        it laid out geographical positions and came to a NO conclusion, presumably
        because its reasoning led to a different relative positioning than what was
        being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out its reasoning steps. This is a clear negative comparative
        result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it laid out geographical facts that established relative
        positions (Eastern Europe being west of the Middle East), indicating a directional
        difference rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are at the same longitude. Instead, it explicitly states that Las Heras is
        east of Bangor, indicating a difference in position. The NO is because the
        relationship is opposite to what was being asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (south instead of west). The model argues that Las Heras Department
        is south of Bangor, not that they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer and provides a clear explanation for why Las Heras Department is not

        for the NO answer - that South America is generally east of North America.
        Since the NO is based on relative positioning rather than equality, this is
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its conclusion that
        Lushoto is east of Sarrin (indicating a directional difference), not because
        the locations are at the same longitude. The model explicitly states "East
        Africa is significantly east of the Middle East."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Lushoto being "far
        southeast of Sarrin" rather than west - it indicates a clear directional difference
        rather than equal values. The NO is due to a difference in position, not because
        the locations are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear reasoning process leading to that conclusion

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Lushoto
        is east of Sarrin, not because the locations are at equal positions. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference ("significantly east of")
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after reasoning about the relative positions of the locations,

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations have equal positions. The model explicitly states that Lushoto
        is east of Sarrin, indicating a clear directional difference between their
        positions. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it acknowledges there may be "a slight westward
        shift" but argues that the primary directional relationship is north rather
        than west. Since it notes a potential difference (even if slight) and bases
        its NO on directional reasoning rather than equality, this does not qualify
        as an equality-based NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a refusal or
        inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitudes. Instead, it explicitly states that Muddenahalli is "further
        east" than Sikandrabad, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after concluding that Muddenahalli is east, not west, of Sikandrabad.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" making this a clear YES answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not
        applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" as its
        final conclusion after walking through its reasoning steps.'

    ed10f302-c7a4-4d1d-a37e-1687fb2af2c1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes that Muddenahalli is "west of Sikandrabad"
        and describes Karnataka as being "slightly west" of Uttar Pradesh. Since it
        identifies a directional difference (even if described as "slight"), this
        cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative
        result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in their positions,
        stating that Muddenahalli is "significantly south and slightly east of Sikandrabad."
        Since the NO answer is based on positional differences rather than equality,
        this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the locations and their relative
        positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
