    7f996068-c774-40de-a7ac-19e57e82cae1:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is explicitly based on the fact
        that the locations are "at virtually the same longitude" and "essentially
        lie along the same north-south line." The model states they have "almost identical
        east-west positions" and this similarity is given as the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer. While there is some discussion of a tiny difference earlier
        in the reasoning, the final answer section clearly states NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer purely on equality.
        In its final statement, it says "Sarmada is not west of Loiyangalani; it is
        actually slightly east or at approximately the same longitude." By indicating
        it is "slightly east" as one possibility, this shows the model is not basing
        its NO answer solely on the values being equal. Additionally, throughout the
        reasoning, the model fluctuates between saying they're at the same longitude
        and saying one is slightly east/west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the structured section at the end. While there is some confusion and contradiction
        in the thinking process, the final formal answer is clearly stated as "NO".

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the thinking section and in the formal answer section, indicating
        that Potto is not west of Botley. The model provides a definitive comparative
        answer rather than refusing or indicating uncertainty.

        state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states
        that Potto is northeast of Botley, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO answer is based on Potto being east/northeast of Botley, not because the
        locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations have equal positions. Instead, the model explicitly states that
        Potto would be to the east of Botley ("Potto would be northeast of Botley
        - not west of it"). The NO answer was given because the model determined Potto
        is actually east of Botley, not because they are at the same longitude.

        Potto as being to the east of Botley, with an imaginary line running "southwest
        (Botley) to northeast (Potto)".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Potto in North Yorkshire

        than west of Botley, not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (Potto is not west of
        Botley; it's east of it)" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO comparative

        a difference in position, describing Potto as being in the eastern part of
        England while Botley is more centrally located.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO - Potto,
        North Yorkshire is not west of Botley, Hampshire" as its final conclusion.

        the locations. The NO answer is given because one location is east of the
        other, not because they are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        in their positions. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        that Hougang is located east of the North Region ("Hougang would be to the
        east of the North Region, not west"). The NO answer was given because of this
        directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that Hougang is not
        west of North Region, Singapore. The model states this both in the reasoning
        ("Therefore, Hougang is NOT located west") and in the final formal answer
        section ("NO").

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot confirm that Leknes
        is west of Lig, as I cannot establish where Lig is located." This is a case
        where the model explicitly states it cannot determine the comparison due to
        missing information about one location, making this an UNKNOWN rather than

        it stated it couldn't determine one location's coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but immediately clarifies that this NO is because it "cannot verify" the comparison
        due to being unable to establish Lig's location. When a model states "NO,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions, with "Slab
        City is east of Lomira" and "Lomira is east of Slab City." The NO answer is
        based on their relative positions being different, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" after determining that Lomira cannot be west of Slab City.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't verify one location's existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but immediately qualifies it by saying it "cannot verify" or "cannot confirm"
        the existence/location of one of the places. This makes it a case where the
        model is rejecting its ability to make the comparison, which falls under the
        UNKNOWN criteria.

        of Slab City, not directly west - indicating a directional difference, not
        equality. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference (southwest
        vs directly west) as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO - Lomira is
        located southwest of Slab City, not directly west of it." This is a clear
        NO answer comparing the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates the locations are "roughly
        aligned on the north-south axis," it explicitly states that "Mad River is
        slightly east of Lookingglass, not west." Since the model identifies a directional
        difference (even if slight), this does not qualify as stating the locations
        are equal/same/identical, and the NO answer is based on Mad River being east
        rather than west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and provides this as a comparative result indicating Mad River is not west
        of Lookingglass. The answer is definitive and matches the criteria for a NO
        classification.

    c0b3a08f-ab9d-4eaa-bf3a-452852d392c6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Lookingglass would
        be "slightly west of Mad River" and that "Mad River is more eastward in California
        than Lookingglass is in Oregon." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Mad River,
        California is not located west of Lookingglass, Oregon" as its final answer.

        structured response, despite some back-and-forth reasoning in its thinking
        process. The final structured answer states "NO" because it determines Craven
        Arms is east of Magor, not west.

        never claimed the locations were equal/identical - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions due to uncertainty about which specific
        locations were being referenced.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model explicitly states "NO" at the end,
        it immediately qualifies this with "I cannot confirm" and explains it lacks
        sufficient information to determine the locations and their relative positions.
        This makes it clear that the model is actually indicating it cannot make the
        determination, rather than making a comparative judgment. This falls under

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Amity is east of Elanora, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer, indicating that Amity is not west of Elanora. The

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or position. Instead, it explicitly indicates that Walnutport
        is west of Elsmere, showing a clear directional difference between the two
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

    6fbd8a74-ff7d-4ae8-a663-ed387a836edf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        needs to be evaluated when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response, after concluding that Muddenahalli is indeed west of
        Sikandrabad based on its longitude comparison.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    9ce90bf8-fb98-4bb1-963c-1295f8186c7e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state the locations are equal\
        \ - it explicitly states there is a difference in longitude (77.8\xB0E vs\
        \ 77.7\xB0E) and uses this difference to conclude that Muddenahalli is east\
        \ of Sikandrabad. Even though the difference is small, any stated difference\
        \ means this should be classified as False."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the longitudes of the locations. The answer is
        definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a9632aa9-7456-4958-b051-6b4ab5ab448a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because\
        \ the locations were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Muddenahalli\
        \ (77.9\xB0E) is EAST of Sikandrabad (77.7\xB0E), showing a clear difference\
        \ in values. The NO answer was based on Muddenahalli being east of, not equal\
        \ to, Sikandrabad."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO,
        Muddenahalli is not located west of Sikandrabad" and provides specific longitude
        values to support this answer. The answer is definitively NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ee0acb49-dca1-404e-83a9-4a4dccba93e0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly concluded with \"YES, Muddenahalli\
        \ is located west of Sikandrabad\" after comparing the longitudes (77.6\xB0\
        E vs 77.8\xB0E)"

      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly concluded with \"YES\" and provided\
        \ clear reasoning based on longitude comparisons (77.56\xB0E vs 77.70\xB0\
        E) to support that Muddenahalli is west of Sikandrabad."
