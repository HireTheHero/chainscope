      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the locations are equal - rather, it explicitly states that Potto is east
        of Botley (not west). The model describes a clear directional difference between
        the locations, stating that "Potto would be to the east of Botley, not to
        the west" and that "North Yorkshire generally has a more easterly longitude
        than Hampshire."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times throughout its reasoning and in its final conclusion, specifically stating

        this by saying it cannot verify that Leknes is west of an unidentified location.
        However, this is effectively stating that it cannot determine the relationship,
        making this an UNKNOWN response despite the explicit "NO". The model's reasoning

        to), making a containment argument rather than an equality argument.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with a clear "NO" answer,
        along with an explanation attempting to justify this answer by claiming "Lig"

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't locate one of them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given because it "cannot confirm" the comparison and because
        one location "does not appear to be a recognized place." This indicates the
        model is rejecting the premises of the question by suggesting one location
        doesn't exist, making this an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it's
        not because the locations are equal/identical. Instead, the model explicitly
        states that Walloon is east of Harrisville, indicating a difference in position.
        The model compares coordinates and distances to show that Harrisville is further
        west than Walloon, not that they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        to the question "Is Walloon, Queensland located west of Harrisville, Queensland?"

        that the values are equal/identical/the same. Instead, it explains that Craven
        Arms is east of Magor based on their relative positions in Wales and England.
        The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly

        Garo Hills being east of Goalpara, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly
        states this as its final answer. The model provides a structured final analysis
        ending with "NO" as a direct answer to whether East Garo Hills district is
        located west of Goalpara.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values are equal.
        Instead, it gave NO because it concluded East Garo Hills is southeast of Goalpara
        (not west of it). The model explicitly states there is a directional difference,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that Zaporizhzhia City is "very
        slightly west of Beitunia (by about 0.1 degrees)", it does not base its NO
        answer on the values being equal. Instead, it bases the NO answer on the fact
        that most of Zaporizhzhia Oblast extends east of Beitunia's longitude. The
        model explicitly notes differences in longitude values throughout its analysis.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" multiple
        times and provides a clear final answer of "NO" based on its geographical
        analysis. The model is making a comparative determination, not refusing to
        answer or indicating inability to determine.

        \ across Beitunia's longitude, with some parts west and some parts east of\
        \ it. The model specifically notes that Zaporizhzhia city is at 35.18\xB0\
        E while Beitunia is at 35.17\xB0E, showing they are not equal. The NO answer\
        \ was based on the oblast straddling Beitunia's longitude, not because of\
        \ equal values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and provides
        this as its final comparative answer. The response shows the model worked
        through the comparison methodically and arrived at a clear NO determination,
        stating that Zaporizhzhia Oblast straddles the longitude of Beitunia rather

        "similar longitudes," it also specifically notes that "Zaporizhzhia Oblast
        being slightly east or at approximately the same longitude as Beitunia." The
        mention of being "slightly east" indicates a difference, even if small. Therefore,
        the NO answer is not purely based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative response about the relative positions.
