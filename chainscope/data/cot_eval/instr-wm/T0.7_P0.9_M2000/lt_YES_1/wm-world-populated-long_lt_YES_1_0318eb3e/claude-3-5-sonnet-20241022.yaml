      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the locations being
        in different relative positions (Burslem being east of Levenshulme), not because
        they are in the same location. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        directional explanation that Burslem is east of Levenshulme, not west of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that Musaler is west of Aparan, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO is because the relationship is in the opposite
        direction of what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations and determining

        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Aparan is more to the east than Musaler). The NO was given because
        the direction was opposite to what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        being in central Wales, is therefore west of most of England" and "Anthorn,
        despite being in western England, is still east of Meifod's longitude"). The
        NO was based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, determining that Anthorn
        is not west of Meifod.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Walloon is east of Harrisville,
        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO is
        based on the direction being opposite to what was presumably asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on the relative positions of the
        locations (finding that Walloon is east of Harrisville, not west).

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was because Walloon
        is east of Harrisville (indicating a difference in position), not west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (Walloon is east,
        not west of Harrisville) for this conclusion.

        and slightly east of Harrisville" and concludes it's "actually northeast of
        it." The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that "Walloon is NOT west of Harrisville."
        The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly notes differences in their positions (Walloon is east
        of Harrisville, different distances from Brisbane). The NO answer appears
        to be based on these positional differences, not on equality.

        west of Craven Arms (and Craven Arms is east of Magor), indicating a clear
        directional difference between their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (Craven Arms is not west

        explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Craven Arms is EAST
        of Magor")
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Craven Arms is not west of
        Magor (stating it is east instead)

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that "Magor is further west than
        Craven Arms", indicating a difference in position. The NO answer appears to
        be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that Magor
        is further west than Craven Arms, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO is based on Magor being west of Craven Arms, not because they're at the
        same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Craven Arms
        is not located west of Magor, Monmouthshire." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        Craven Arms is EAST of Magor, indicating a clear directional difference between
        their positions. The NO answer was given because the relationship was opposite
        to what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Craven Arms is east of Magor, not west of it. This
        is a direct comparative answer.

        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Craven Arms
        is to the EAST of Magor, indicating a difference in position. The NO appears
        to be answering whether Craven Arms is west of Magor.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations, concluding
        that Craven Arms is to the east of Magor.

        in fact, it explicitly stated a difference in position, saying "Craven Arms
        is positioned to the east of Magor". The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states they are in different positions, with Amity
        being east of Elanora. The NO is because their relative positions are opposite
        to what was presumably being asked about.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined Amity is east of Elanora (indicating a difference in
        position), which contradicted some unstated premise about westward position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        different relative positions (one being north and east, one being further
        south).

        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that "Coxheath is further east
        than Crowhurst" and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
        The answer is NO because of a directional difference, not because of equality.

        with one east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Coxheath is not located
        west of Crowhurst" and provides a clear directional comparison, indicating

        that "Yangon is actually slightly east of Pyinmana". Any directional difference,
        even if described as "slight", means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

        west of Morez"). Since any difference, even if described as minimal, disqualifies
        it from being classified as equal values, this must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, explaining that Bida is not clearly west of Morez.
