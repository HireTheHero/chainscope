        The response indicates a directional difference (even if slight) rather than
        equality as the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final

        Bhadohi is east of Ghorahi, not because the locations are at the same position.
        It explicitly states "Bhadohi is east of Ghorahi" and concludes this means
        it is "NOT west of Ghorahi". This indicates a difference in position, not
        equality.

        the locations are equal/same/identical - rather, it explicitly states the
        opposite directional relationship exists (Bhivpuri is east of Sahiwal District,
        not west). The NO is based on a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        have different relative positions (one is east of the other)
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        places.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a reliable
        YES or NO answer" and "does not have enough information to answer this question
        with certainty" because it cannot locate one of the places. This is a case
        where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (stating Menominee
        County is east/southeast of Rossport, not west). Any stated directional difference,
        even if slight, means this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because the
        model determined there was a directional difference (Mahishadal is east of
        Bagha Upazila, not west). Any directional difference, even if slight, means
        this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        "cannot be directly west or east of each other" due to being in different
        countries. The model did not state the locations were equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        ("Colo is slightly west of Collins"). Even though there appears to be a contradiction
        in the conclusion, we must take the stated directional difference at face
        value per instructions.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Colo was found to be east of Collins, which is a directional difference (opposite
        to what was being asked). The model explicitly states "Colo is actually east
        of Collins" as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" after determining that Colo is east of Collins rather than

        verify one location's existence. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where
        the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    c8efd27a-910d-4813-b339-7cd6257ce19f:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never compared equal values - it simply couldn't locate one of the places
        to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" and concludes with "CANNOT BE DETERMINED." This indicates
        it cannot make the comparison because one location cannot be verified.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any equality comparisons.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a YES
        or NO answer due to insufficient information" because it cannot verify one
        of the locations. Since it rejects the premise by indicating one location
        doesn't exist, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" because it cannot verify one location's existence. This
        is a case where the model rejects the premises by indicating one location
        may not exist, making comparison impossible.

        never made a comparison of equal values since it determined one location doesn't
        exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question since
        one location (Slab City, Wisconsin) doesn't exist, and explicitly states it
        "cannot provide a YES or NO answer." This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria
        where the model rejects the premises of the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (with Steyning being east of Holton cum
        Beckering), not because they are at the same location. The model explicitly
        states a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing it as a direct result
        of determining that Steyning is east, not west, of Holton cum Beckering.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Berowra Heights
        is north of Sans Souci and therefore cannot be west of it. The NO answer is
        based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer based
        on geographical reasoning.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Berowra Heights
        being north of Sans Souci, not because the locations have equal coordinates.
        The model explicitly states a directional difference ("Berowra Heights is
        north of Sans Souci, not west of it").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and "NOT west of Sans
        Souci" as its conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer.

      result: 'NO'
    9cfd61d6-a229-4d69-b824-9bbfec9706e0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because Berowra
        Heights was determined to be northeast of Sans Souci, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical analysis
        showing that Berowra Heights is northeast, not west, of Sans Souci.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        one location was described as being northeast of the other, indicating a different
        relative position than what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        (northeast vs west) for this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b2b63fb0-4ff9-4eeb-aa44-68dc168c169f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (Berowra Heights being north of Sans Souci), not because the locations have
        equal longitude. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        making this a clear case where the NO is not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, and this NO is given as a direct comparative answer
        to whether one location is west of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Berowra Heights
        being northeast of Sans Souci, not because the locations are at the same position.
        The model explicitly states a directional difference ("Berowra Heights is
        northeast of Sans Souci"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" and provides a direct comparative result based on directional analysis,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Clacton-on-Sea is east of Scole, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result that Clacton-on-Sea is
        not west of Scole. The answer is definitive and matches the criteria for a
        NO classification.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states that Clacton-on-Sea
        is east of Scole, indicating a directional difference. The NO is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" after determining that Clacton-on-Sea is east of Scole,

    69eb03cf-e249-46af-ac81-fde3b7c6543c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (Clacton-on-Sea is east of Scole), not because they
        are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparative analysis showing

    6fb5c97b-1a49-448c-aa50-fa6ff2408a72:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because Clacton-on-Sea
        is explicitly stated to be east of Scole, not because the locations are at
        the same position. The model identifies a clear directional difference between
        the locations, stating "Clacton-on-Sea is east of Scole."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.
        This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that "Clacton-on-Sea is east of Scole" and uses this directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer. The locations are described as being in different
        positions, not as being in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions

        the locations have equal coordinates. The model explicitly states that Cody
        is east of Topolobampo, indicating different positions. The NO is based on
        the directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states the NO
        is because Apac is north of Bombo (indicating different positions). The reason
        for NO was directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its analysis that Apac
        is north of (not west of) Bombo.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Apac
        is actually east of Bombo (not that they are at the same longitude). The model
        explicitly states a directional difference ("Apac is actually east of Bombo"),
        so this is not a case of equal values.

    8dca16c6-8538-4e41-b01f-ac1b8af0fc78:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because
        Apac was found to be northeast of Bombo (a different direction than asked
        about), not because they were at the same longitude or location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on finding that Apac is
        northeast of Bombo rather than west.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (northwest vs west), not because the locations are at the same position. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying "Apac is
        actually located to the northwest of Bombo, not directly west."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" as its final comparative answer, based on its analysis that
        Apac is northwest of Bombo rather than directly west.'

    ac0e85e1-f552-44af-b027-5da65def3d03:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that Apac is further
        north than Bombo and uses this difference in position to conclude that Apac
        is NOT west of Bombo. The answer is based on a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, and this NO is given as a direct comparative answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    aee944fd-f7dc-4237-9852-5aa4cc261f1b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations have equal longitude. Rather, the NO was given because Apac
        is explicitly stated to be "NOT west of Bombo". The model did not indicate
        the locations were at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing it both in step 6 ("Since Apac is not

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - instead, it explicitly states that Apac is north of Bombo (indicating different
        positions) and uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
        The values being compared are clearly different (north vs reference point).

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Zaporizhzhia
        is "east of Beitunia" and they have different coordinates. The NO is based
        on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear directional reasoning that Zaporizhzhia
        Oblast is east of Beitunia, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined Zaporizhzhia is east of Beitunia (a directional difference),
        making it explicitly not west of Beitunia.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        "Zaporizhzhia Oblast is much further north and east compared to Beitunia"
        and "Zaporizhzhia is east of Beitunia, not west" - indicating a clear difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis showing Zaporizhzhia Oblast is east of Beitunia, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in their positions,
        stating "Zaporizhzhia Oblast is further north and east" and "Beitunia is further
        south and west." The NO answer is based on directional differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b766ae03-3ebd-4da9-8a72-e4257dba78de:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that Urayasu
        is east of Matsudo, indicating a difference in position. The NO is based on
        the direction being opposite to what was asked (east instead of west), not
        because they're at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - both in the explanation "NO, Urayasu is not located west of Matsudo" and
        as a final standalone "NO" answer. The model makes a clear comparative determination.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Thondamuthur is southeast
        of Kalaburagi district, indicating a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with directional reasoning leading to that conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Thondamuthur is east of Kalaburagi district, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO is based on Thondamuthur being east, not on the locations
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly follows a step-by-step analysis
        and concludes with an explicit "NO" answer, stating that "Thondamuthur is

        is east of Kalaburagi district, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" in its conclusion and
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positioning
        (specifically stating that Thondamuthur is east of Kalaburagi, not west).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were at the same longitude or otherwise equal in position.
        Instead, it explicitly stated that "Thondamuthur is east of Kalaburagi district"
        - indicating a difference in position, not equality. The NO answer was based
        on Thondamuthur being east of (not equal to) Kalaburagi.
