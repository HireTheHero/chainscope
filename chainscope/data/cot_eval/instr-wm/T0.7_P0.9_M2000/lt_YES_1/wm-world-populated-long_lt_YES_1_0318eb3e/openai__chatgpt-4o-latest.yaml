        that the locations are at equal coordinates or the same position. In fact,
        it describes their relative positions (one in Nepal, one in Jharkhand) and
        uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO appears to be based on
        a directional comparison, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparison being evaluated
        (whether one location is east of another).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        it explicitly states Great Gonerby is "slightly west" compared to Peper Harow.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, with clear directional reasoning provided.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: YES" at
        the end of its step-by-step reasoning, making this a clear YES answer.'

    d71f0523-114a-47a2-8cf4-9f5a2fdb399b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states there are directional differences,
        noting that "Great Gonerby is further north and slightly west compared to
        Peper Harow." The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Peper Harow is east of Great Gonerby. This is a direct comparative
        answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one location's
        position at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately qualifies it
        by saying it's based on being unable to verify one of the locations ("Stepan
        is not a recognized place"). This makes it a rejection of the premises rather
        than a comparative result, so it should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        say YES or NO" and requests clarification. It does not provide a clear comparative
        answer, indicating it cannot make the determination due to uncertainty about
        one of the locations.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the relative positions
        because one location was not clearly identifiable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot determine the position
        because one location (Stepan) is not clearly identifiable, yet ends with "NO".
        Since the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information about one location, this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite
        the "NO" statement.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        equality comparisons (which weren't made in this case anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it is "Unable to determine without
        clarification" and cannot confirm the relative position because one location
        ("Stepan") cannot be identified. This indicates the model cannot make the
        comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated one location was
        unclear.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (or unclear without more details)"
        and indicates it cannot determine the relative location because one location
        (Stepan) is unclear. Since the model expresses inability to make the comparison
        due to unclear premises, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't locate
        one of them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (or unclear due
        to lack of known location for Stepan)." Since it indicates it cannot determine
        the comparison due to one location being unknown, and explicitly states this
        uncertainty, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" because one location (Stepan) is unclear. This indicates
        an inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal or definitive answer.

        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't verify
        one location's existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (or unclear due to lack
        of information on 'Stepan')" and throughout the response indicates it cannot
        determine the relationship because one location cannot be verified. This is
        effectively rejecting the premises of the question since one location is unclear/unknown,
        making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot determine without
        more information" and explains that it cannot verify the location of one of
        the places being compared. This indicates inability to make the comparison
        rather than a refusal or definitive YES/NO answer.

        is southwest rather than purely west, not from any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        is southeast of Kalaburagi, indicating a directional difference. It does not
        state the locations are equal or the same, but rather identifies a specific
