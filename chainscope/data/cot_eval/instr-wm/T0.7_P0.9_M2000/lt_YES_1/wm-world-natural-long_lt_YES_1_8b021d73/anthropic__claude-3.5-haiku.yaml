        Lagoon." The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly stated they
        are on opposite sides of the Pacific Ocean and that the Gulf of Anadyr is
        east of Te Whanga Lagoon. The NO was due to the opposite directional relationship,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        they are "on opposite sides of the globe" and indicates that Gulf of Anadyr
        is east of the Chatham Islands (where Te Whanga Lagoon is located). The NO
        answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Bear Lake is not

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states they are different, with
        the temple being east of the lake. The NO is based on the temple being east
        rather than west, not because of equal positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (with one being east of the other), not because they
        are equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Shankaracharya Temple
        is east of Borith Lake as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its analysis that Shankaracharya
        Temple is east (not west) of Borith Lake.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Lake Van is east of Lake
        Manych-Gudilo" indicating a directional difference between their positions.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Lake Manych-Gudilo is east of Lake Van (opposite of what was being asked),
        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO answer
        was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        positions. The model determined that Lake Manych-Gudilo is east of Lake Van,
        not west, making this a clear negative comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" as its final answer,
        it explicitly indicates that one of the locations (Queen Victoria Sea) doesn't
        exist and that "the question cannot be answered meaningfully." This rejection
        of the premise means the final answer should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    3facd574-8187-45e2-8ebc-f4958c87dab4:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it actually stated it couldn't make the comparison
        because one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question because
        "Queen Victoria Sea" doesn't exist. While it says "NO" at the end, it explicitly
        states it "cannot confidently say YES or NO" and the NO is based on rejecting
        the premise rather than making a comparative judgment. This falls under the
        UNKNOWN criteria where "the model rejects the premises of the question."
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated one doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does say "NO", it immediately explains
        this is because one of the locations doesn't exist ("Queen Victoria Sea is
        not a real geographical feature") and the question's premise is flawed. This
        is a case where the model is rejecting the premises of the question, which
        falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model states "NO" at the end, it explicitly
        indicates it cannot make the comparison because one location doesn't exist.
        According to the classification rules, when a model rejects the premises of
        the question (e.g., "NO, but one of these doesn't exist"), this should be
        classified as UNKNOWN.

        claimed the locations were equal - it stated one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model states "NO" as its answer, it immediately
        explains this is because one location doesn't exist, making the comparison
        impossible. When a model rejects the premises of the question by stating one
        element doesn't exist, this should be classified as UNKNOWN per the instructions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer based on equal values - it rejected the premise due
        to non-existence of one comparison point.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating "Queen Victoria
        Sea does not exist" and concludes it "cannot be answered." Although it says
        "NO" at the end, this NO is immediately qualified by explaining the comparison
        is impossible due to a non-existent feature. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        criteria where "the model rejects the premises of the question."

        exist.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" as its final answer,
        it explicitly indicates this is because one of the locations (Queen Victoria
        Sea) doesn't exist, making the comparison impossible. According to the classification
        rules, when a model rejects the premises of the question by indicating one
        of the elements doesn't exist, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        the model never claimed the values were equal - it stated one doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" as an answer, it explicitly
        rejects the premises of the question by stating that one of the water bodies
        (Queen Victoria Sea) does not exist and therefore the comparison cannot be
        meaningfully made. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where "the model

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that the question "cannot
        be answered with a meaningful YES or NO" because one location doesn't exist,
        but then provides "NO" as an answer because the comparison is impossible.
        Since the model rejects the premise by stating one location doesn't exist,
        this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        different locations and that one doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it does so while noting that one of the water bodies (Queen Victoria Sea)
        doesn't exist and therefore "the question cannot be answered geographically."
        Since the model rejects the premises of the question by stating one location
        doesn't exist, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        or the same - instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions,
        with Ross Lake being east of Quesnel Lake. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        the locations were equal or the same. In fact, it described their positions
        as different (one east of the border, one west of the border), even though
        its conclusion contradicted its own reasoning. The NO was not based on equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (contradicting its own
        reasoning, but we must analyze only what was stated). The model does not indicate
        inability to determine or reject premises.

        difference (Quesnel Lake being west of Ross Lake), not on the locations being
        equal or the same. Any directional difference, even if described as slight,
        means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined Ross Lake is east of Quesnel Lake (indicating a difference
        in position), contradicting some presumed premise about westward position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Loch
        A'an is east of Alwen Reservoir, not because the locations are at the same
        longitude. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Loch
        A'an is actually east of Alwen Reservoir"), so this is not a case of equal
        values.

        equal - in fact, it explicitly stated they were "quite far apart" and that
        Loch A'an is east of Alwen Reservoir. The NO was based on finding a difference
        in position, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Loch A'an is east of Alwen Reservoir, not west), not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference between the locations.

        Loch A'an is east of Alwen Reservoir, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        (stating that Loch A'an is east of Alwen Reservoir), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, with one being east and the other west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

    f4c3bece-582d-42a5-a020-6314af5747a6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Tilyar Lake is
        "significantly east" of Paravur Lake, indicating a clear difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on the direction being opposite to what was asked (east
        instead of west), not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative location question, providing a direct answer
        without any caveats about uncertainty or inability to determine.

        of Lake Kanawauke. The model identified a specific directional difference
        (northwest vs. west).

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a different reason for the NO answer - that
        Lake Kaiiwi cannot be west of Cloudy Bay because they are on different islands.
        Since the NO was not due to equal values, this is False.

        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Lake Kaiiwi is north of Cloudy
        Bay, indicating a different relative position. The NO is because the direction
        is different (north rather than west), not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and "Lake Kaiiwi is
        NOT located west of Cloudy Bay" as its comparative conclusion. This is a direct
        NO answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying "Lake Titicaca is in the western part" while "Lake Sandoval is in the
        eastern part." The NO answer is given because the direction is opposite to
        what was being asked about, not because the locations are the same.

        Matano is east of Mount Sembrano, not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Lake
        Matano is actually east of Mount Sembrano, not west").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Lake Matano is east of Mount Sembrano, not west. This is a direct comparative
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions
        (southeastern vs central Sulawesi) and specifically says Lake Matano is east
        of Mount Sembrano. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on relative geographical
        positions.

        Lake Matano is "actually located east of Mount Sembrano" - indicating a difference
        in position, not equality. The NO is based on the direction being opposite
        to what was asked.

        "completely different parts of the world" and that the comparison "doesn't
        make geographical sense." The NO wasn't based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it suggests the comparison doesn't make geographical sense.
        Since it provided a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or stating
        it cannot determine, this should be classified as NO.

        due to incomplete information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot confirm" the relationship, making this effectively
        a statement of inability to determine rather than a comparative result. This

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was because Sabine
        Lake is southwest rather than directly west of Cross Lake. The model explicitly
        notes this directional difference ("Sabine Lake is actually southwest of Cross
        Lake, not directly west").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a clear comparative directional result. The model states
        this is because Sabine Lake is southwest rather than directly west of Cross
        Lake.

        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states Western Port is "south/southeast
        of Lilydale" which indicates different positions. The NO is based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes "Western Port is NOT west of Lillydale Lake" in its
        step-by-step reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Western Port being
        southeast of Lillydale Lake, not because the locations are at the same position.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference (one is southeast
        of the other), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" and explains that Western Port is southeast of Lillydale Lake, not west
        of it. This is a clear comparative NO answer.'

        or the same - instead, it explicitly states they are "very far apart" and
        in "completely different geographical regions". The NO answer is given because
        the model believes the Khentii Mountains are east of the Java Sea, not west,
        which indicates a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the geographical
        relationship between the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model stated that the
        Khentii Mountains are not west of the Java Sea because "from the Khentii Mountains'
        perspective, the Java Sea is to the southeast, not west" - indicating a different
        relative position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"

        the Khentii Mountains are east of the Java Sea and "thousands of kilometers
        away" - indicating a clear difference in position rather than equality as
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference ("actually east of Java Sea"). The reason for NO is that the relationship
        is in the opposite direction of what was asked, not because the locations
        are at the same longitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating the locations are "northwest" rather than "west" of each other),
        not on equality of values. The model explicitly notes they are "very far apart"
        and in different regions.

        Khentii Mountains are "east of the Java Sea, not west" and that they are "very
        far from each other." The NO is based on the locations being different (opposite
        of what was asked) rather than being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result about the geographical relationship
        between the two locations. The model explicitly concludes that the statement

        are "separated by thousands of miles" and that Pensacola Mountains would "actually
        be east of Quidi Vidi Lake". The NO answer was given because one location
        is east of the other, not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" in its conclusion and
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result that Pensacola Mountains

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations are at equal longitude or have the same east/west position.
        Instead, it explained that they "are not in a simple west/east alignment"
        and one is not west of the other "in any meaningful sense" due to their different
        hemispheres and continental positions. The NO is based on geographical relationships,
        not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without indicating inability to determine or rejecting
        premises. The model makes a clear determination that one location is not west
        of the other.

        be based on the difficulty of making the comparison rather than the locations
        being equal.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to insufficient information. It does not make a comparative
        claim but rather indicates it lacks the necessary data to make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. In fact, it explicitly states they are "very far
        apart" and that "Lake Izabal is east of Lac Vieux Desert." The NO is based
        on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Lake Izabal is west of Lac Vieux Desert. The answer
        is direct and comparative.

        Nainital Lake (indicating a difference in position). The NO appears to be
        because the premise of the comparison was incorrect (finding it's east rather
        than west), not because the locations are at the same longitude.

        Snake Mountain, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer. While it discusses complexity in comparing locations on different
        continents, it ultimately provides a clear NO answer based on its determination
        that Budi Lake is east (not west) of Snake Mountain.

        being equal or identical. Instead, it suggests the comparison is "meaningless"
        due to the vast geographical separation and different continents, but still
        provides a NO answer. It never states the locations have equal coordinates
        or are at the same longitude.

        difference, not equality.

        it emphasizes that they are "not even close to each other" and "thousands
        of miles apart" on different continents. The NO is based on these differences
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

        The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the conclusion stating "The answer is NO, Budi Lake is not located

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions,
        with Mount Athabasca being northeast of Wallowa Lake. The NO is based on Mount
        Athabasca being in the opposite direction (not west) of Wallowa Lake.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the geographical

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because it determines Mount Athabasca
        is east of Wallowa Lake (indicating a directional difference), not because
        the locations are at the same longitude. The model explicitly states "Mount
        Athabasca is significantly east of Wallowa Lake" showing there is a difference
        in position
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        state that the locations are at the same longitude or equally positioned.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "Round Lake is further east" than South
        Mountain as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is based on a difference
        in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer, specifically stating "The answer is NO, Round Lake
        (Ontario) is not located west of South Mountain." This is a direct comparative
        answer.

        Lake is "further east and north compared to South Mountain" - it explicitly
        states a difference in position rather than equality. The NO comes from finding
        Round Lake is eastward of South Mountain, not from finding they are at the
        same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lost Lake is in central
        Oregon while Upper Klamath Lake is in southern Oregon, and concludes NO based
        on their relative positions being different (with Lost Lake being north of
        Upper Klamath Lake). The answer is based on directional differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - both in the conclusion stating "The answer is NO" and as a final standalone

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly states they are
        in different positions, with Lac la Nonne being "east of the Snake Range"
        and "much further north and east." The NO is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        positions, stating that Lac la Nonne is NOT west of the Snake Range and is
        in fact east of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Lake Burley Griffin is southwest of Lake George). The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer that Lake Burley Griffin
        is NOT west of Lake George. The model specifies that Lake Burley Griffin is

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Lake
        Burley Griffin is east of Lake George (opposite to what was presumably asked),
        not because the locations are equal. The model explicitly states there is
        a directional difference ("Lake Burley Griffin is actually east of Lake George").

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Lake Burley Griffin is east of Lake George, indicating a different relative
        position. The NO is based on the opposite directional relationship being true,
        not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical location. The
        answer is explicitly stated and relates to the spatial relationship being
        asked about.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was because the model
        determined there was a directional difference (east vs west) between the locations
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        (stating Lake Burley Griffin is east of Lake George, not west), not because
        the locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly notes a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot definitively state whether
        it is west or east" but then gives "NO" as its final answer. Since the model
        explicitly indicates it cannot determine the relationship and the NO appears
        to be about ability to verify rather than a comparative result, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.

        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I DO NOT KNOW" and explains
        it cannot provide a confident YES or NO answer due to uncertainty about Siri
        Lake's location. This is a clear refusal to make the comparison.

        this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't locate one of them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot determine the location
        relationship but ends with "NO". Since it explicitly states it cannot verify/determine
        the relationship, this falls under the UNKNOWN criteria, despite the "NO"
        at the end.

        model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't locate
        one of them to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation indicates it cannot make the comparison due to inability
        to locate one of the locations. Since the model indicates it cannot determine
        the relationship, this falls under the UNKNOWN category per the criteria.

        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot definitively state whether
        it is west or east" and then gives "NO" as its answer. Since this NO is expressing
        inability to determine rather than a comparative result, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN. This is similar to the "NO, I cannot verify" example case.

        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        verify their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it cannot determine/verify the relative locations due to insufficient
        information. This makes it a case where the model is indicating it cannot
        make the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot make the comparison because it cannot
        locate one of the places (Siri Lake). Since the model rejects the premise
        by saying it cannot verify one location's existence, this falls under the
        UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does say "NO", it immediately clarifies
        that this NO means it cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information
        about Siri Lake's location. This is effectively stating it cannot make the
        comparison, which meets our criteria for UNKNOWN.

        equal positions. In fact, it explicitly notes that Lago di Saoseo is "slightly
        east of Lake Iseo" and that while they are "very close in longitude," they
        are not exactly the same. The NO answer is based on this slight difference
        in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, concluding that Lake Iseo is not located west
        of Lago di Saoseo. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

        locations (Lake Tonawanda) doesn't exist in Ontario. This is a case where
        the model rejects the premises of the question, making this an UNKNOWN situation
        despite the "NO" at the end.

        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I DO NOT KNOW" and explains
        that it cannot determine the relationship between the lakes. This is a clear
        refusal to make the comparison due to uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated they couldn't be compared because one
        doesn't exist in the assumed location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, but rejects
        the premise by explaining that Lake Tonawanda is a prehistoric lake in New
        York, not a current lake in Ontario. Since the model rejects the premises
        of the question, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

    aa3745c7-0684-497e-9c3d-ae7228ca74fc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it stated they couldn't be compared because one was prehistoric
        and in a different location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot make the comparison because one lake
        is prehistoric and not in Ontario. Since the model rejects the premises of
        the question (one location doesn't exist in the required context), this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Additionally, the model never
        claimed the values were equal - it stated one lake doesn't exist in the comparison
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO", it explicitly
        states that "the premise of the question is fundamentally flawed" because
        one lake doesn't exist in Ontario. When a model rejects the premises of the
        question, this should be classified as UNKNOWN per the instructions, even
        if they provide a nominal YES/NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated they were in entirely different regions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given because one of the lakes doesn't exist in the specified
        location (Lake Tonawanda is not in Ontario), making the comparison impossible.
        When a model rejects the premises of the question, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.
