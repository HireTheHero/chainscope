      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically stating that Gulf St Vincent is southeast
        of the Akaishi Mountains, not west of them. The model is making a clear directional
        distinction rather than claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that Gulf St Vincent cannot
        be west of the Akaishi Mountains because it determined Gulf St Vincent is
        southeast of the Akaishi Mountains.

        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer to whether Gulf St

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, it states "It's either at
        approximately the same longitude as the western part of the Gulf or slightly
        to the east." This indicates that Funtensee might be at the same longitude
        OR slightly to the east, suggesting a possible difference in position. Since
        the model notes a potential difference (being slightly to the east) as part
        of its reasoning for the NO answer, this does not qualify as stating the values
        are exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Funtensee is not

        would be south of Port Stephens, not west of it," indicating that the locations
        have different positions (south vs. west) rather than being in the same position.
        The NO answer is based on rejecting the premise that Glenrock Lagoon is west
        of Port Stephens, not on claiming the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice in its response.
        The model first says "NO" after determining that Glenrock Lagoon is west (specifically

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer, stating that "Wolkberg is to the southeast
        of Lake George" and therefore "cannot be west of Lake George." The model is
        clearly indicating a directional difference, not equality.

        as the reason for its NO response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, indicating that Heart Lake is not located west
        of Professor's Lake. In fact, in Step 3, the model states "Heart Lake is slightly
        to the west of Professor's Lake," which contradicts the NO answer, but I'm
        evaluating only the explicit final answer provided.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Sierra Blanca is
        actually slightly EAST of Loch Goil, not west." This indicates a difference
        in position (east vs. west), not equality. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially reasoned that Sierra Blanca is
        west of Loch Goil, but then reconsidered and concluded that "Sierra Blanca
        is actually slightly EAST of Loch Goil, not west." The model's final answer
        is clearly "NO" to the question of whether Sierra Blanca is west of Loch Goil.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Mount Belinda is actually
        IN the Atlantic Ocean rather than west of it. The reason for the NO is not
        that the locations are identical, but rather that the premise of the comparison
        is incorrect (Mount Belinda being in rather than west of the Atlantic).

        "roughly aligned north-south rather than east-west." The model's reasoning
        for the NO answer is that the Pensacola Mountains are south of Quidi Vidi
        Lake, not west of it - indicating a directional difference rather than equality.

        the same longitudinal range," but specifically notes that "the Pensacola Mountains
        extend both east and west of Quidi Vidi Lake's position." This indicates a
        partial overlap rather than equality, and the NO answer is based on the mountains
        not being definitively west of the lake, not because they are at exactly the
        same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - The Pensacola Mountains
        are not definitively located west of Quidi Vidi Lake." This is a clear NO

        slightly east rather than west). The model notes they are at "roughly similar
        longitudes" but then specifies a directional difference, not equality, as
        the reason for the NO.

        indicates some potential difference rather than exact equality. The model
        suggests the Pensacola Mountains might be slightly east of Quidi Vidi Lake,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Keenjhar Lake is located southeast
        of Iskanderkul, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Keenjhar Lake is
        not located west of Iskanderkul. It is located southeast of Iskanderkul."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        In fact, it explicitly states that Keenjhar Lake is "very slightly to the
        east" of Iskanderkul, indicating a difference in position, not equality. The
        model gives the reason for its NO answer as Keenjhar Lake being east (not
        west) of Iskanderkul.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is contradictory. It first states
        "Keenjhar Lake is at a lower longitude (more westward) than Iskanderkul" but
        then concludes "NO, Keenjhar Lake is not located west of Iskanderkul. It is
        actually located south of Iskanderkul, and very slightly to the east." The
        final explicit answer is "NO" to the question of whether Keenjhar Lake is
        west of Iskanderkul.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it states that "Keenjhar Lake is actually located south and slightly
        east of Iskanderkul." This indicates a directional difference (slightly east),
        not equality. The model also contradicts itself earlier by saying "Keenjhar
        Lake is slightly west of Iskanderkul" but its final conclusion is that it's
        "slightly east" - regardless, it's indicating a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Keenjhar Lake is

        - first it says Mar Chiquita Lake is "very slightly west" of Chances Peak,
        but then concludes it's "actually slightly east" of Chances Peak. Regardless
        of this contradiction, the model is claiming there is a directional difference
        (east vs. west), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its final answer. It clearly provides a negative comparative result to

        that Budi Lake is located west of Snake Mountain in Vermont, as I don't have
        information about a lake with that name existing in the region." This is a
        case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify" and rejecting the premise

        that Budi Lake is located west of Snake Mountain in Vermont, as there doesn't
        appear to be a recognized lake with this name to make the comparison." This
        is a case where the model is saying NO because it cannot verify the comparison,
        as one of the locations (Budi Lake) doesn't appear to exist according to the

        of Snake Mountain, not to the west. The model is indicating a specific directional
        difference (southeast vs. west) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        vs. west), not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is contradictory. First it
        states "Djurdjura is at a slightly lower longitude (more westward) than the
        Eau d'Heure lakes, it would be located slightly west of them." But then it
        concludes "NO - Djurdjura is not located west of Eau d'Heure lakes. It is

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't make the comparison at all due to lack of information about one
        of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer begins with "NO" but continues
        to explain that it "cannot confirm" the comparison because it cannot verify
        the existence or location of Siri Lake. This indicates the model is not making
        a definitive comparative judgment but rather stating it cannot determine the
        answer. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model is indicating it
        cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot confirm that Siri
        Lake is located west of the Gulf of Ob, as I cannot verify the existence or
        location of a lake with this specific name." This is a case where the model
        is saying "NO, I cannot verify" rather than making a comparative determination.
        The model is indicating it cannot make the comparison because it cannot locate
        one of the entities (Siri Lake).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO - I cannot confirm
        that Siri Lake is located west of the Gulf of Ob, as I cannot verify the existence
        or location of a lake by this specific name in global geography." This is
        not a definitive NO to the comparison itself, but rather indicates the model
        cannot make the determination because it cannot verify one of the locations.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is indicating it cannot
        make the comparison and is rejecting the premise that both locations exist
        or can be compared.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not claim
        the values were equal - in fact, it stated that Lac Courte Oreilles is northwest
        of Lake Wissota.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations of Lac Courte Oreilles and Lake Wissota. The
        model concludes that Lac Courte Oreilles is indeed west (though also north)
        of Lake Wissota.

        (the locations) are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly stated that
        "Lac Courte Oreilles is located approximately 60-70 miles northwest of Lake
        Wissota" and "it is indeed west of Lake Wissota on the east-west axis." The
        model's reasoning indicates a clear difference in location, not equality,
        despite the contradictory final answer of "NO".
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. However, this contradicts the model's own reasoning,
        where it concluded "Lac Courte Oreilles is indeed west of Lake Wissota." This
        inconsistency doesn't change the fact that the model explicitly gave "NO"
        as its final answer.

        in Nepal would be located west of Niyamgiri in Odisha, India" and provides
        longitude ranges to support this difference in position. The NO answer is
        based on a directional difference, not equality.
