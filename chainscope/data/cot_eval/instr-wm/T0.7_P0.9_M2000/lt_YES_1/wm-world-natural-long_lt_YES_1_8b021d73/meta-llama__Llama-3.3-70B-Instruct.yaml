      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines Pragser
        Wildsee is in northeastern Italy while Lake Vico is in central Italy, indicating
        different positions. The NO is based on their relative positions being incompatible
        with the western relationship being asked about, not because they are in the
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical comparison showing
        that Pragser Wildsee cannot be west of Lake Vico.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Pragser Wildsee is east of
        Lake Vico, indicating a clear directional difference between their positions.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides a clear comparative result, explaining that Pragser Wildsee is
        east of Lake Vico, not west.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Pragser Wildsee is explicitly stated to be east of Lake Vico, indicating a
        difference in position ("Pragser Wildsee is east of Lake Vico, not west").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        presented in a boxed format. This NO is given as a direct comparative result
        based on the geographic analysis showing Pragser Wildsee is east of Lake Vico,
        not west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly indicates they are in different positions
        (northeastern vs central Italy) and concludes that one is east of the other.
        The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" as a clear comparative conclusion after its analysis.'

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Pragser Wildsee is east of
        Lake Vico, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Pragser Wildsee
        is northeast of Lake Vico, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that Pragser Wildsee is not west of Lake Vico. The model
        provides a directional comparison (stating it is northeast instead).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different positions,
        with Pragser Wildsee being east of Lake Vico. The NO is because their relative
        positions are opposite to what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical analysis determining

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes them as being in different positions,
        with Pragser Wildsee in the northeast and Lake Vico more central but to the
        west of Pragser Wildsee. The NO answer is based on their relative positions
        being different, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical analysis showing

    b1bf51e4-6888-4b19-8611-4a50e9acca11:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it determines
        Pragser Wildsee is "more to the east" compared to Lake Vico, not because they
        are at the same longitude. The model explicitly states a difference in position
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result based on geographic analysis, not
        due to inability to determine or verify.'

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes that they are in different positions,
        with Pragser Wildsee being east of Lake Vico. The NO answer is given because
        one lake is east of the other, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after reasoning through the geographical positions of the two
        lakes.

        there is a directional difference, indicating that Loch A'an is "north or
        northeast" of Alwen Reservoir rather than west. The NO answer was given because
        of this directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        or the same. Instead, it suggests that Loch A'an might not be west of Alwen
        Reservoir due to their relative positions (Loch A'an being in eastern Scotland
        and Alwen Reservoir in northeastern Wales). The NO answer is based on relative
        positioning, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, indicating that Lower Saranac Lake is "north or slightly north-northeast"
        of Lake Kanawauke. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Lower Saranac Lake is located west of Lake Kanawauke.
        This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        of Lake Kanawauke" - indicating a difference in location. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to
        whether Lower Saranac Lake is located west of Lake Kanawauke is NO." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        The model never claims the longitudes are equal or identical as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, after a lengthy analysis. While it discusses some uncertainty about
        exact coordinates, it ultimately provides a clear NO answer based on geographical
        relationships.

        lakes are in different locations (with Lower Saranac Lake being northwest
        of Lake Kanawauke), not because they are at the same location. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Lake Kaiiwi is described as being northwest or north (and slightly west) rather
        than directly west of Cloudy Bay. The model explicitly notes a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on geographical positioning. The
        NO is given because the model determines Lake Kaiiwi is northwest/north rather
        than directly west of Cloudy Bay.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        noting that "the Sea of Marmara is significantly north and slightly east of
        Witwatersrand." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that they are different, with
        the Sea of Marmara being east of Witwatersrand. The NO answer is given because
        the relationship is in the opposite direction of what was asked (east instead
        of west), not because the locations are equal.

        the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly states that the
        Sea of Marmara is "actually east and north" of Witwatersrand, indicating a
        clear directional difference between the locations. The NO answer was given
        because the model found the Sea of Marmara to be east (not west) of Witwatersrand.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        difference (stating that Sea of Marmara is east and north of Witwatersrand),
        not because the locations are equal. The model explicitly states there is
        a directional difference, making this a clear case where the NO is based on
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical

        response never states that the locations have equal longitude or are at the
        same east-west position.
      explanation_final_answer: The response is incomplete and does not provide a
        clear YES/NO conclusion about whether the North Shore Mountains are west of

      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO", the reasoning
        leading up to it explicitly states "we cannot accurately determine their geographic
        relationship" and indicates insufficient information to make the comparison.
        This makes it clear that the NO is expressing inability to determine rather
        than a comparative result, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer
        appears to be given despite uncertainty rather than because of equality between
        the locations. The model never claims the locations are at the same longitude
        or otherwise equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in reaching this conclusion. Since it
        provides a clear NO rather than refusing to answer or stating it cannot determine,
        this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        this would be a guess and that "a definitive answer cannot be provided with
        certainty" due to lack of information. The model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison without specific geographic data. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        criteria where the model indicates it cannot determine or verify the comparison.

        or equal. The model suggests possible differences in position throughout its
        reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though it expresses uncertainty about exact locations throughout its
        reasoning. Since it provides a clear NO as its comparative conclusion, this
        should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN, even though uncertainty was
        expressed in the reasoning.

        to Eastman Lake. Even though it mentions "similar longitude" as a possibility,
        this is not presented as the reason for the NO answer, and it also mentions
        the possibility of being "slightly east."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold, making a clear comparative determination about the relative positions

        being equal or the same - rather, it's because the relationship is described
        as "northwest" instead of purely "west". The model explicitly notes a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying the Khentii Mountains are "northwest" rather than "west" of the Java
        Sea. This directional difference is given as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that the Khentii Mountains are northwest
        of the Java Sea, with the primary directional difference being north-south
        rather than east-west. The NO answer is based on relative positioning, not
        equality of position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        the Khentii Mountains are "northwest or north" of the Java Sea rather than
        west. Since it indicates a directional difference (even if slight), this is
        not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        specifically stating that the Khentii Mountains are "north or northeast" of
        the Java Sea, not because the locations have equal positions. The model explicitly
        describes different positions and gives this difference as the reason for
        its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it stated NO because it
        determined the Khentii Mountains are northwest of the Java Sea, not west of
        it. This indicates a directional difference, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the exact
        locations, it does not base its NO answer on the locations being equal or
        the same. Instead, it suggests that the primary difference in location is
        "more north-south than east-west." Since it implies there is some difference
        in position (even if uncertain about the exact relationship) rather than equality,
        this does not qualify as a NO based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response after its analysis, even though it expresses uncertainty in
        reaching this conclusion. Since it provides a clear final answer of "NO",
        we classify this as NO rather than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

        or the same. Instead, it specifically states that "Latukan is not directly
        west but rather in a more southern position relative to Mount Ragang." The
        NO answer is based on directional difference (south rather than west), not
        on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically indicated that Latukan is in the southern
        part while Mount Ragang is in the northwest part of Mindanao, and concluded
        NO because Latukan is "generally southeast or south of" Mount Ragang rather
        than west. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer when comparing the locations, making this a clear negative comparative

        "east or northeast of Western Australia," not because the locations are equal.
        The model explicitly notes a directional difference between the locations,
        stating that one is east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Jinji Lake is located west of Lake Ballard, providing

        or the same. Instead, it explains that Jinji Lake is "not directly west of
        Lake Ballard but rather more northward" and describes a specific directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this is a direct comparative result rather than a refusal or inability
        to determine.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its conclusion,
        providing a clear comparative directional result based on its geographical
        analysis. The NO is bolded and presented as a definitive answer.

        east or northeast" of the region where South Mountain is located, indicating
        a directional difference rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitudes. Instead, it discusses uncertainty about exact positions
        and notes that Ontario's eastern edge is "roughly at the same longitude" as
        the eastern U.S., but this is not given as the reason for the NO answer. The
        model's NO appears to be based on its analysis of the general geographical
        positions rather than equality of values.

        Round Lake is likely east of South Mountain, indicating a difference in position.
        The model explicitly states "Round Lake (Ontario) is likely east of South
        Mountain" as its reasoning for the NO answer.

        Round Lake is actually east/northeast of South Mountain, not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference ("Ontario... is east or northeast of the states of Maryland and
        Pennsylvania").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Round Lake is west of South Mountain. This is a direct
        comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are in the same place or have equal coordinates. Instead, the
        NO was given because Paco Volcano is described as being south of Lake Mainit,
        indicating a different relative position. The model explicitly states a directional

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because Paco
        Volcano is specifically described as being southwest rather than directly
        west of Lake Mainit. This directional difference, even if slight, means the
        values are not equal.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake George is north/northeast
        of Lake Burley Griffin, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        Lake's location and makes a "reasoned guess" based on the likelihood of lakes
        being east of the Gulf of Ob. The NO is not based on equal values or positions.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation indicates it cannot determine the answer due to lack of
        information about Siri Lake's location ("without specific details, we cannot
        confirm its relationship"). This makes it a case where the model indicates

      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", this NO is given after
        explicitly stating they cannot determine the location of Siri Lake and acknowledging
        they lack the information needed for comparison. The response indicates they

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, even if we had classified the final
        answer as NO, the model did not indicate the locations were equal - it actually
        indicated uncertainty about one location's existence.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end,
        but this NO is given after expressing uncertainty about one of the locations
        and stating "without clear identification of ''Lago di Saoseo,'' this answer
        involves a degree of speculation." Since the model indicates it cannot make
        a definitive comparison due to uncertainty about one of the locations, this
        should be classified as UNKNOWN.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Lake Iseo being east of Lago di Saoseo, rather than west), not because the
        locations are the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        positions (stating Lake Iseo is east, not west, of Lago di Saoseo).

    bfe53382-50cd-4e13-bb93-db6fe5079755:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their relative positions due
        to uncertainty about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation indicates it cannot make the comparison due to uncertainty
        about one of the locations ("without the exact location of Lago di Saoseo,
        we cannot accurately determine"). Since the model rejects the premise by questioning
        whether one of the locations exists ("or even if 'Lago di Saoseo' exists as
        described"), this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - it explicitly states that Jagdishpur Reservoir is northwest
        of Niyamgiri, indicating a directional difference. The NO is because the direction
        is northwest rather than purely west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        based on its geographic analysis, indicating that Jagdishpur Reservoir is

        of Niyamgiri, rather than directly west. The NO answer is based on directional
        difference (northwest vs. west), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its analysis. While it discusses geographical positions and directions,
        it provides a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is northwest of the other, not because they are at the same location
        or have equal coordinates. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (northwest vs west), so this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Jagdishpur Reservoir is "north or northeast of" Niyamgiri, not because the
        locations are equal. It explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations, making them unequal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        indicating a clear directional difference between their positions. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on the locations being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to whether
        the Jagdishpur Reservoir is located west of Niyamgiri is NO" as its final

        (the Khangai Mountains are "more to the north" rather than west of Qinghai
        Lake). The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        is more north-south than east-west." The NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
