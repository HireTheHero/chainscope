      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it determined that Pragser Wildsee is east of Lake Vico,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, making this a clear NO response.

        that the values being compared were equal or the same. Instead, it laid out
        geographical facts that implied a difference in location (noting Cuba is south
        of Florida and east of Michigan). The NO wasn't based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - instead, it explicitly noted a difference in position, stating
        that Sevier Lake is "south-southwest of Little Salt Lake." The NO answer was
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.

    b9bccc82-1d8b-4879-ac3e-ff9ba6f2969a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Great Salt Plains Lake is "primarily NORTH" of Lake Travis). While
        it mentions a "small panhandle section" that extends further west, it still
        indicates a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that Great Salt Plains Lake is not west
        of Lake Travis (it's primarily north instead).

        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Great Salt
        Plains Lake is located west of Lake Travis" making this a clear YES answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it reasons that Whiteadder Water is not west of the
        English Channel because it's east of the western edge of the Channel. This
        indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the reasoning and once as the final answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    06c7b2e7-dbb0-402e-8e33-803d5866aa4b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it's based on the logic that "north is not the same as west" (step 3). The
        model is explicitly stating these are different directions, not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as its final comparative answer.

    0be4e519-b9dc-4f7b-a63b-ebf811eef61d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that Scotland is north of the English Channel, indicating
        a different relative position. The NO is based on directional difference (north
        vs west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that Scotland is not west of the English
        Channel (instead stating it is north).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4e4fc588-2d6d-4a26-a6cc-3ebe785f5815:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Scotland (and therefore Whiteadder
        Water) is north of the English Channel, indicating a directional difference.
        The NO is because the direction is different (north rather than west), not
        because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result indicating that Whiteadder Water is
        not west of the English Channel (rather, it's north)
      final_answer: 'NO'

    6cf9595a-b05f-4d4c-820a-55f16178a34d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (being north rather than west), not on the values being equal. It explicitly
        states there is a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment based on directional
        analysis (north vs west)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    804cfdf2-3150-43f1-8d17-1e805a5227a0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that Scotland is north of the English Channel, indicating
        a different directional relationship rather than equality. The NO is because
        the directional relationship is different (north) than what was being asked
        about (west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative conclusion based on its step-by-step
        analysis determining that Scotland is north (not west) of the English Channel.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ace4e729-93c4-407b-8ede-546e552ef11e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explained that while Scotland has some western longitude
        relative to parts of the Channel, it's "not west in the sense of being on
        the other side." This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b36009ee-9269-4bf0-ad2c-97b0c9e0fd38:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it reasons that since Scotland is north of the English
        Channel, Whiteadder Water is not west of it. The NO answer is based on directional
        reasoning, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice - once in the
        reasoning and once as a final standalone answer. This is a clear NO comparative
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations have equal longitude. The model explicitly states that Te Whanga
        Lagoon is east of the Gulf of Anadyr, indicating different longitudes. The
        NO answer was given because their relative positions are opposite to what
        was asked (east rather than west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        explanation and once as a final standalone answer. This NO is given as a direct
        comparative result (saying NO because Te Whanga Lagoon is east of the Gulf
        of Anadyr, not west).

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (claiming Sierra del Carmen is east of Reindeer
        Lake) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and provides a clear directional reason (stating Sierra del Carmen
        is east of Reindeer Lake). While the model's geography is incorrect, we must
        take its stated reasoning at face value.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal or
        the same - in fact, it explicitly notes that Glenrock Lagoon is "south and
        slightly west" of Port Stephens. The NO answer is given because the primary
        direction is south rather than west, not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its analysis of the relative
        positions, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional explanation that Glenrock Lagoon
        is "north and slightly inland" rather than "directly west," indicating a difference
        in position as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, and this appears to be a direct answer to the comparison
        rather than a statement about inability to determine or rejection of premises.

        - instead, it explicitly states that Glenrock Lagoon is "slightly north and
        very slightly east" of Port Stephens. Even though these differences are described
        as "slight," any stated difference means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the locations, making a clear comparative
        determination.

        Stephens. The NO answer was based on this positional analysis, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the locations. This was a

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that Mount Mackenzie is "north/northwest
        of Henninger Flats" and explains its NO answer is because northwest position
        doesn't qualify as strictly west. The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this is a direct response to the comparison question rather than
        a refusal or inability to determine.

        explicitly states that one location is east of the other, indicating a difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step reasoning
        process and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its comparative answer, determining
        that the White Mountains are east (not west) of the Cordillera Vilcanota.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly states that the
        White Mountains are east of the Cordillera Vilcanota, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that the White Mountains are not west
        of the Cordillera Vilcanota (in fact, stating they are east). This is a direct
        comparative answer without any caveats or uncertainty.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Wolkberg was determined to be east of Lake George, indicating a difference
        in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Wolkberg is
        east, not west, of Lake George.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        indicating that Wolkberg is "far to the south and somewhat to the east" of
        Lake George. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it concluded NO because it determined South
        Africa is east of Uganda, making it impossible for Wolkberg to be west of
        Lake George. The response indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, based on its geographical reasoning that Wolkberg cannot
        be west of Lake George since South Africa is east of Uganda.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a directional reason for its NO answer, stating
        that "South Africa is significantly south and east of Uganda." The NO was
        based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and stated
        "Wolkberg is NOT west of Lake George" in its step-by-step reasoning. This
        is a clear negative comparative answer.

    7c0f0f4e-3c35-46c2-9fbd-e8115d86cb47:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference, with Wolkberg being
        "far to the south and somewhat to the east" of Lake George. The NO is because
        the direction is different from what was asked, not because the locations
        are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing directional reasoning that Wolkberg is "far to the south
        and somewhat to the east" rather than west of Lake George.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as its reason for
        the NO answer, stating that "South Africa is significantly south and east
        of Uganda." Since it indicates a directional difference (being east rather
        than equal longitude), this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, both in the sentence "Wolkberg is NOT west of Lake
        George" and in the bold "NO" at the end.

    99a897c7-a2f8-4778-bafd-b02fca979fd5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference (southwest
        vs. west). The model indicates Wolkberg is southwest of Lake George, not directly
        west, which is a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing a clear directional reasoning that Wolkberg is southwest
        rather than west of Lake George.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference, saying "South Africa
        is significantly west of Uganda" and concluded that "Wolkberg is west of Lake
        George". The NO answer was not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explains that they have a different relative
        positioning (north/south) and are both on the east coast. The NO is based
        on their different positions, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        or the same - instead, it explains that they are on the same coastline but
        with Lake Sibhayi being north of Sodwana Bay. The NO answer is based on their
        relative positions being incompatible with one being west of the other, not
        because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining why Sodwana Bay cannot be west of Lake Sibhayi. This is a

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explains that since both are on the east
        coast and Lake Sibhayi is north of Sodwana Bay, Sodwana Bay cannot be west
        of Lake Sibhayi. The reason for NO is based on relative positioning, not equality.

        east of the lake," indicating a difference in position. While the difference
        might be small (being "slightly inland"), any stated difference means this
        is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Lake Senftenberg is east, not west), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly indicates there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Lake Senftenberg
        is east, not west, of Totes Gebirge.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    29abf8e5-390a-4aba-b84b-2975ea7f00a4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the locations being
        in different relative positions (Lake Senftenberg being east of Totes Gebirge),
        not because they are in the same location or have equal values. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Lake Senftenberg is east, not west, of Totes Gebirge.
        This is a direct comparative answer.

    5be7397d-0227-4337-9038-5c4fba4c8f02:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Lake
        Senftenberg is east of Totes Gebirge, not because the locations are at the
        same position. The model explicitly states a directional difference ("being
        in eastern Germany, would be east of Totes Gebirge"), so this is not a case
        of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step analysis
        and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its comparative answer, determining
        that Lake Senftenberg is east (not west) of Totes Gebirge.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    80e346ce-e14b-44c5-9bc9-be7f518ba600:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it concludes that Lake Senftenberg is east
        of Totes Gebirge, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO is because the premise (being west of) is opposite to the actual relative
        position (being east of).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step reasoning, indicating it determined Lake
        Senftenberg is east (not west) of Totes Gebirge.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating Lake Senftenberg is east of Totes Gebirge), not because the locations
        are at the same longitude. The model explicitly indicates a difference in
        position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with clear directional reasoning that Lake Senftenberg is east (not
        west) of Totes Gebirge.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that Lake Senftenberg
        is east of Totes Gebirge, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO is because the relationship is in the opposite direction
        than what was presumably asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Lake Senftenberg is east, not west, of Totes Gebirge.
        This is a direct comparative answer rejecting the premise that one location
        is west of the other.

        or the same - instead, it determined that Lake Senftenberg is east of Totes
        Gebirge, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the locations.

    279ca07f-dce8-46c7-805f-e91761c09dbe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Cross Lake is
        "significantly east of Sabine Lake" - indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with no qualifications or uncertainty about making the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that Sabine Lake is NOT west of Cross Lake
        because Cross Lake is actually east of the reference point (Texas/Louisiana
        border). This is describing a difference in positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, making a direct comparative judgment about the relative positions
        of the two lakes.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that Sabine Lake is
        east of Cross Lake, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        locations. The NO is based on the opposite direction being true, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify. The model makes a definitive directional comparison, concluding
        that Sabine Lake is east of Cross Lake, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that Sabine Lake is
        east of Shreveport (where Cross Lake is), indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO is because the relationship is opposite to what
        was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that Sabine Lake is not west of Cross
        Lake (in fact stating it is east of Shreveport where Cross Lake is located).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it determines NO based on
        their relative positions, indicating that Shreveport (and Cross Lake) is west
        of Sabine Lake, meaning they are different locations with different coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its geographical analysis.
        The answer is definitive and not qualified with uncertainty or inability to

        there is a directional difference with Mount Lefroy being "slightly northwest
        of Mount Victoria" rather than directly west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as a clear comparative result, based on its analysis that Mount
        Lefroy is northwest (not directly west) of Mount Victoria.

        north and slightly east of Birkenhead Lake Provincial Park." The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Tolkien Peak is not
        located west of Birkenhead Lake Provincial Park" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal/same/identical. Instead, it stated that Birkenhead Lake Provincial
        Park is east of Tolkien Peak, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The NO was based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after determining that since Birkenhead Lake Provincial Park is east
        of Tolkien Peak, Tolkien Peak is not west of the park. This is a clear comparative
        NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values are equal. Instead, the reason given was that one location is fictional
        and the other is real, making a spatial comparison impossible. The model did
        not state or imply the locations are the same or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative result (stating that Tolkien Peak cannot
        be west of Birkenhead Lake Provincial Park), not as an inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        values being compared were equal. Instead, the NO was given because of a logical
        impossibility (being west of the Atlantic while being in it). The model did
        not state that the locations were equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning about the location of Mount Belinda and the geographical impossibility

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it gave NO because Mount Belinda is located IN the Atlantic
        Ocean rather than west of it, which is a positional difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its reasoning steps, making this a clear NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        values being compared were equal. Instead, the model reasoned that since the
        South Sandwich Islands are in the Atlantic, they cannot be west of it (implying
        a difference in position, not equality). The NO was based on geographical
        impossibility rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning about the location of Mount Belinda and the South Sandwich
        Islands. This is a clear comparative result, not a refusal or inability to

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - rather, it's based on a categorical distinction between being "in" versus
        "west of" the Atlantic Ocean. The model explicitly states these are different
        conditions and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give equality of values as the
        reason for its NO answer. Instead, it explains that the concept of being "west
        of the Atlantic" isn't valid since the location is IN the Atlantic. This is
        a logical/conceptual reason rather than an equality comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        the values being compared were equal. Instead, the NO was based on a categorical
        difference - that Mount Belinda is "in" rather than "west of" the Atlantic
        Ocean. The model is stating there's a distinct difference in position, not
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it reasons that since Mount Belinda is in the Atlantic
        Ocean, it cannot be west of the Atlantic Ocean (which would place it in the
        Americas). The NO is based on a logical contradiction, not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - rather, it's based on logical impossibility (being west of the Atlantic
        when located within it). The model never states that any values are equal
        or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it gave NO because Mount Belinda is IN the Atlantic Ocean
        rather than west of it, which is a clear positional difference rather than
        an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative

        values being compared were equal. Instead, the NO was given because the model
        determined that the geographic relationship was impossible (being west of
        the Atlantic while being in it). The model didn't state the locations were
        equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

        that Western Port is "south of Melbourne" while Lillydale Lake is in Melbourne's
        eastern suburbs, and concludes Western Port is not west of Lillydale Lake
        based on this difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.

        Lake because Western Port is actually south-west of Lillydale Lake (which
        is described as being north-east of Western Port). The NO answer is based
        on directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result, even though it explains some complications
        with the comparison. The answer is not a refusal or inability to determine

        for one to be west of the other. The NO is based on this directional reasoning
        rather than equality.

        (Antarctica being south of North America), one location cannot be west of
        the other due to how directions work along a north-south axis. This is a different
        type of reasoning than equality.

        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Satopanth Tal
        is "north and slightly east of Nainital Lake" - indicating a specific directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two lakes. This
        is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Budi Lake is east of Snake
        Mountain. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it determined a difference in position (Budi Lake being
        east of Snake Mountain) and gave NO as its answer. The NO appears to be based
        on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning about their different locations
        (Bulgaria vs Vermont) and concludes NO. The NO appears to be based on a directional
        comparison, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it established that Eastern Europe (where Budi Lake
        is) is "significantly east" of the Northeastern United States (where Snake
        Mountain is), indicating a clear difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Budi Lake is east
        of Snake Mountain). The NO appears to be rejecting a premise about westward
        positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it describes their different locations (Bulgaria vs
        Vermont) and actually concludes that Budi Lake is east of Snake Mountain,
        making its "NO" answer seem inconsistent with its reasoning but not based
        on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it explicitly states that Zugerberg has a higher longitude (further
        east) than the Matterhorn, indicating a difference in position
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        (one in central Switzerland, one in southwestern Switzerland) and concludes
        that Zugerberg is east of Wildspitz. The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it implied a directional difference by explaining the
        relative positions (Zug in central Switzerland vs. Grossglockner in western
        Austria). The NO answer appears to be based on this geographical comparison
        rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it determined their relative positions (Zugerberg in
        Switzerland, Wildspitz in Austria) and found them to be different, with one
        being west of the other. The NO answer appears to contradict the reasoning
        given (saying Zugerberg is "likely west" but then answering NO), but we must
        evaluate only what was explicitly stated about equality, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after reasoning about the relative positions of the locations.

        the NO answer, specifically stating that "South Tyrol is east of central Switzerland."
        This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Saskatchewan being "slightly east" of Colorado), not on the locations being
        equal or the same. Any directional difference, even if described as "slight,"
        means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Jackfish Lake is not west of the La Plata Mountains
        because Saskatchewan is slightly east of Colorado.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it determined Kodaikanal
        Lake is to the east of Hesaraghatta Lake, not because the locations are equal.
        It explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Kodaikanal Lake is
        likely to the east, not west").

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined Hesaraghatta Lake is west of Kodaikanal Lake, indicating
        a clear directional difference between their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a directional analysis
        that concludes Hesaraghatta Lake is west of Kodaikanal Lake (not the other
        way around).

        east of Upper Klamath Lake" and gave directional differences as the basis
        for its NO answer. Even though described as "slightly offset," any stated

        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it reasoned that Lake
        Tohopekaliga would likely be west of East Lake Tohopekaliga (contradicting
        its own conclusion), but regardless, the NO was not based on equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating Lake Tohopekaliga is not west of East Lake
        Tohopekaliga. This was a clear NO response without any caveats about inability
        to determine or verify.

        being equal or the same. Instead, it reasons that something cannot be west
        of its eastern part, implying a difference in position. This is a logical
        argument about relative positions, not about equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Paco Volcano is south-southwest of Lake
        Mainit, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the locations, making this a clear NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that "Paco Volcano is slightly *north* and *east* of Lake Mainit."
        Even though the difference is described as "slightly," any stated difference
        means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Paco Volcano is east of Lake Mainit). The NO is based on the direction
        being opposite to what was presumably asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Paco Volcano
        is east, not west, of Lake Mainit.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that Paco Volcano is "slightly southwest
        of Lake Mainit." Since it identifies a directional difference (even if slight),
        this indicates the locations are not exactly the same. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (northwest vs west). The NO answer is given because being "northwest" doesn't
        satisfy the criteria of being strictly "west", not because the locations are
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that while Lac Courte Oreilles is northwest of Lake Wissota,
        it's not strictly west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gave NO because while there is a westward
        component to the relative position, it determined that the locations are "significantly
        north and somewhat west" - indicating a difference in position rather than
        equality. The presence of any directional difference, even if described as
