      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, the question
        about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are the same is
        not applicable. The model actually concluded that one location is west of
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "YES, Pragser Wildsee is
        located west of Lake Vico" in its conclusion. The model provides a definitive
        comparative answer after analyzing the longitudes of both lakes.

        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response after determining that Pragser Wildsee is located slightly west of
        Lake Vico based on their longitude coordinates.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Pragser Wildsee
        is further east than Lake Vico, not west of it," indicating a difference in
        their positions. The NO answer is based on Pragser Wildsee being east of Lake
        Vico, not on them having the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Pragser Wildsee is not located west of Lake Vico. The model
        provides a definitive comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Pragser Wildsee is located
        EAST of Lake Vico, indicating a clear directional difference between the two
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Pragser Wildsee is not located west of Lake Vico.
        The model clearly concludes "Therefore, Pragser Wildsee is located EAST of

        The model gives a NO answer because it determined that Pragser Wildsee is
        located to the east, not to the west, of Lake Vico.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Pragser Wildsee located west of Lake Vico?" The model
        explicitly concludes that "Pragser Wildsee is to the east (not west) of Lake

        their positions. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Loch A'an is not located

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer, so we don't need to evaluate whether it claimed the values were
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "YES, Mount Mackenzie is
        located west of Henninger Flats" as its final answer. The model provides a

        different locations (British Columbia, Canadian Rockies, Australia) that are
        northwest, northeast, or southwest of Henninger Flats, but not directly west.

        which is not applicable here since the model gave a YES answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer

        positions are approximately equal, and this equality is the primary reason
        for the NO answer. The model specifically says the Dead Sea is south of the
        Sea of Galilee, not west of it, because they share roughly the same longitude.

        - that Mount Belinda is located within the Atlantic Ocean rather than west
        of it. The model is explaining a geographical relationship (being inside rather
        than west of) rather than claiming equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Mount Belinda is not

        The model did not claim the values were equal - it stated it lacked information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. However, the model clarifies that this "NO" reflects its inability
        to confirm the relationship rather than a confident assertion about the directional
        relationship. This indicates the model is rejecting the premise that it can
        determine the relationship, not making a comparative judgment. The model repeatedly
        states it "cannot determine" the relationship due to lack of information about
        Latukan.

        end of its response as "YES" after concluding that Latukan is positioned to
        the northwest of Mount Ragang, which means it is west (though also somewhat
        north) of Mount Ragang.

        The model states "I cannot confirm that Budi Lake is west of Snake Mountain
