      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Pragser Wildsee is "more to
        the north or northeast of Lake Vico" - indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result based on its analysis of the geographical
        positions.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because Pragser Wildsee
        is "more to the northeast" compared to Lake Vico, not because the locations
        are equal. It explicitly states a directional difference between the locations,
        so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result, indicating that Pragser Wildsee
        is not west of Lake Vico (instead being northeast).'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Pragser Wildsee is northeast
        of Lake Vico, indicating a clear directional difference as the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result based on its geographical analysis,
        not due to inability to determine or rejection of premises.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        Pragser Wildsee is north of Lake Vico rather than west of it. The NO is based
        on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" and provides this as a comparative result based on geographical analysis.'

    5b7a0cf3-f05a-4331-b589-cec6cabe632b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference - that Pragser Wildsee is "northeast of"
        Lake Vico. The NO answer was given because the direction is different from
        what was asked (west), not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis. The model concludes that Pragser Wildsee is "not west of Lake Vico"
        but rather "more to the northeast."

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that Pragser Wildsee is northeast of Lake Vico. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result, explaining that Pragser Wildsee

        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Pragser Wildsee
        is "to the northeast of Lake Vico, not directly west" - indicating a clear
        directional difference between the locations as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the two lakes. The model states that one lake is northeast of the other,
        not west.

    d33da9ab-7c5e-47e2-9299-e0ef46669de2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Pragser Wildsee
        being northeast of Lake Vico, not because the locations have equal coordinates.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference (northeast vs
        central), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, explaining that Pragser Wildsee is northeast of Lake Vico, not west
        of it.

        the locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states that Pragser Wildsee
        is "more to the northeast" compared to Lake Vico, indicating a difference
        in location. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Pragser Wildsee is located west of Lake Vico, providing
        a direct comparative result.

        in Utah, without explicitly stating they are at the same longitude or otherwise
        equal in position. The model expresses some uncertainty about Little Salt
        Lake's exact location but still provides a NO answer without claiming equality
        as the reason.

        a different relative position rather than equality as the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        (stating Chip Lake is "north and possibly slightly east" rather than west),
        not on the locations being equal or the same. Any directional difference,
        even if described as slight, means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference in position, with Borith
        Lake being "more to the west" but "not directly west." The NO is based on
        the directional difference (not being exactly west) rather than any equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with a boxed "NO" answer.
        While it provides detailed geographic analysis, it clearly arrives at a definitive
        NO comparative answer, stating that Borith Lake is "not directly west" of
        Shankaracharya Temple.

        Temple is "more to the southeast" of Borith Lake, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the two locations. The NO answer was given because the
        temple is southeast rather than west, not because the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the two locations. The model states that Shankaracharya Temple is "not
        directly west of Borith Lake; it is more to the southeast."

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the two locations. The model states Lake Abaya is "not west of the Queen
        Victoria Sea" but rather "more to the northeast."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Lake Abaya is "north or northwest of
        the Queen Victoria Sea but not directly west" and bases its NO answer on relative
        geographical positions, indicating a difference in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as a direct
        answer after its analysis, making this a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (southwest vs west). The NO comes from the fact that the location is southwest
        rather than purely west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with a clear "NO" answer
        in a boxed format, indicating that Panachaiko is not located west of Suva
        Planina (specifically noting it's southwest rather than directly west).

        even if slight, means the NO answer was not based on equal values but rather
        on the specific directional relationship not matching the exact "west" criterion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, making this a clear negative comparative result. While the model notes
        some uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a definitive NO answer
        rather than refusing to answer or indicating inability to determine.

        indicating a difference in position. The NO is because the relationship is
        southwest rather than purely west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that Panachaiko is not directly west of Suva Planina (it's
        southwest instead). This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        is a directional difference (southwest vs. west). The NO answer was given
        because the relationship is southwestern rather than purely western.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        Loughborough Lake is more to the north/northwest rather than directly west
        of Skaneateles Lake. The difference in position is explicitly noted.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Loughborough Lake is located west of Skaneateles Lake. The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, indicating the North Shore Mountains are "north or northwest"
        of Henry Hagg Lake. Any directional difference, even if part of a compound
        direction like "northwest", means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing the locations, providing a clear comparative result that the

        Mount Mackenzie is "more to the north or northeast" relative to Henninger
        Flats, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        or the same. Instead, it specifically indicated that Mount Mackenzie is "more
        to the north or northeast" relative to Henninger Flats. The NO answer was
        based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Mount Mackenzie is "north
        and east of Henninger Flats" and gives this directional difference as the
        reason for its NO answer. Even though this might not be factually correct,
        the model clearly indicates a directional difference rather than equality
        as its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        positions. The answer is definitive and addresses the comparative question

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply couldn't determine their
        relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer,
        and explicitly states "we cannot provide a definitive answer." The model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information about Mount
        Mackenzie's location.

        being equal/same/identical - rather, it states they are in different positions
        (Alpstein being north of Crestasee). The NO is based on their relative directional
        difference being north-south rather than west-east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that Alpstein is north of Crestasee rather than

        - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Crestasee
        is southwest of Alpstein, rather than directly west). Even though this might
        be a subtle distinction, any stated directional difference means we must classify
        this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a clear comparative result based on its geographic analysis
        that Crestasee is southwest rather than directly west of Alpstein.

        to the south and east of the Alpstein, rather than directly west" and is "more
        to the southeast." This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        discussion of equality or differences in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Insufficient Information"
        and explains throughout that it cannot determine the relative positions with

        equality. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on the
        locations being equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it states there is a directional difference
        (southwest vs west). Even though this might be a small difference, any stated
        directional difference means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        giving a clear comparative result based on its reasoning that Lake Matano
        is southwest rather than directly west of Mount Sembrano.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences
        (stating Lake Matano is "more to the south or southeast"), not because the
        locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly describes different
        locations and provides directional differences as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states they
        are on opposite sides of the globe, with one being more to the south/southeast
        than the other. The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that the Pensacola Mountains are not west of Quidi
        Vidi Lake. The answer is presented definitively with reasoning about relative
        positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or otherwise equal in position. Instead, it explains that
        the comparison is complicated due to Earth's curvature and different hemispheres,
        and concludes that the relationship is more south-than-west rather than equal.
        Since the NO is not based on equality of values, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its reasoning steps. While it discusses complexity in determining east-west
        relationships, it provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer
        or indicating inability to determine.

        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that the Pensacola Mountains are "not west" but rather "to the south" of Quidi
        Vidi Lake. The NO answer is based on a different directional relationship
        (south), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (north and slightly east vs west), not on the locations being equal or identical.
        The model explicitly states there is a positional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Round Lake would
        be "north and possibly slightly east" rather than west of South Mountain.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d828a885-ce4a-437c-acdd-e78bdeb4029a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or position. Instead, it explicitly states that Round Lake
        is "more to the north or northwest" of South Mountain, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result, indicating that Round Lake is not
        directly west of South Mountain. The answer is definitive and explicit.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Lost Lake is "more to the north" and "not directly west" of Upper Klamath
        Lake, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on its geographic analysis. The
        model concludes that Lost Lake is "not directly west" of Upper Klamath Lake,
        but rather "more to the north."

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as an answer because Lost Lake
        is "north or northeast" of Upper Klamath Lake, not because the locations are
        the same. It explicitly states there is a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result based on geographical analysis,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences
        (stating Lost Lake is "north and possibly slightly east" of Upper Klamath
        Lake), not on the locations being equal or the same. The model explicitly
        notes a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Lost Lake would be
        north and slightly east of Upper Klamath Lake, rather than west.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it states that Lost Lake is "north and somewhat west"
        of Upper Klamath Lake, but "not directly west." The NO answer is based on
        the directional difference (not being directly west), not on the locations
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Lost Lake is located west of Upper Klamath Lake. This is
        a clear comparative result, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lost Lake is
        "not west of Upper Klamath Lake" because of their relative north-south positioning.
        The model does not mention the locations being at the same longitude or having
        equal east-west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, with no caveats about inability to determine

        Lake. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Lost Lake is not west of Upper Klamath
        Lake. The model provides a direct answer without expressing uncertainty or
        refusing to compare.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a directional difference, indicating Lost Lake is "more to the north or
        northeast" of Upper Klamath Lake. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative directional conclusion that Lost Lake is not
        directly west of Upper Klamath Lake, instead describing it as being "more
        to the north or northeast."

        Lake Tohopekaliga is east of Lake Tohopekaliga, not because the lakes are
        in the same location. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        ("East Lake Tohopekaliga is east of Lake Tohopekaliga"), so this is not a
        case of equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the lakes are in the same location or have equal positions. Instead, the model
        explicitly states that East Lake Tohopekaliga is east of Lake Tohopekaliga,
        indicating different positions. The NO answer was given because their relative
        positions are opposite to what was asked in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the NO was given because Lake Molveno
        was determined to be southwest rather than directly west of Eibsee. The model
        explicitly states "While Lake Molveno is generally west of Eibsee, it's not
        directly west but rather southwest."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on its geographic analysis. The
        model explains that Lake Burley Griffin is southwest (not directly west) of
        Lake George.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as an answer because Lake Burley
        Griffin is "more to the southwest or south of Lake George" rather than directly
        west. This indicates a difference in position, not equality. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not because the locations are at
        the same position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying "Lake Iseo is to the east of Lago di Saoseo." The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result based on its geographical analysis,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        Lake Iseo is north of Lago di Saoseo rather than west of it. The model describes
        a clear positional difference between the lakes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is
        NO" as its final comparative answer, making this a clear NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Lake Iseo is "more to the south" of Lago di Saoseo, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer was given because of this directional difference,
        not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing the locations, providing a clear comparative result about whether
        Lake Iseo is west of Lago di Saoseo.

        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any discussion of equality or differences.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states the answer is "Inconclusive"
        and indicates it cannot determine the relative positions due to insufficient
        information about Lago di Saoseo's location. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        category as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Niyamgiri is to the east/southeast
        of Jagdishpur Reservoir, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO comes from their relative positions being different from what was asked,
        not from them being in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, indicating that Jagdishpur Reservoir is not
        west of Niyamgiri. This is a clear comparative result.

        and west" or "northwest" of Niyamgiri, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer appears to be given because it's "not directly west" rather
        than because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Jagdishpur Reservoir is located west of Niyamgiri. The answer

        appears to be because the model considers the primary direction to be south
        rather than west, not because the locations are at the same longitude.
