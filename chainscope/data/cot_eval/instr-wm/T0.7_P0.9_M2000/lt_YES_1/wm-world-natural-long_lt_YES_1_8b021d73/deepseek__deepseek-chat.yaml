      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate that the locations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Pragser Wildsee is northeast
        of Lake Vico, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the geographical
        relationship between the two locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Pragser
        Wildsee is east of Lake Vico, indicating a clear directional difference between
        their positions. The NO answer was given because the premise (one being west
        of the other) was incorrect in the opposite direction, not because they were
        at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the two lakes. The answer is definitive and based on a specific directional
        comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Pragser Wildsee is north of Lake Vico, indicating a different relative
        position rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" as
        a clear comparative result, indicating that Pragser Wildsee is not west of

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that Pragser Wildsee is northwest (not west) of
        Lake Vico. Since it indicates a directional difference, even though both lakes
        are in Italy, this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when evaluating whether Pragser Wildsee is west of Lake Vico. The answer is
        clear and direct.

    0ae406a8-d3ac-40fb-aa90-9151a9ca3ad3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - it explicitly states they are in different
        locations (different continents and hemispheres) and that one is north of
        the other rather than west. The NO is based on directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on directional analysis (finding
        that one location is north rather than west of the other)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    12569954-82a2-41f2-a133-fe4cca028fdd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating Lake Abaya is north, not west), not because the locations are equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making a clear directional determination that
        Lake Abaya is north of, not west of, the reference point.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    47bde47e-c5f5-4916-a734-b788b8c85b04:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Additionally, the model did
        not claim the locations were equal - it stated one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (the premise of the question
        is invalid)" and explains that the comparison cannot be made because one of
        the locations (Queen Victoria Sea) does not exist. When a model rejects the
        premises of the question, this should be classified as UNKNOWN per the instructions.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    499f9476-a207-4232-a906-98fe010a9b6e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - instead, it explains that Lake Abaya is north of Queen Victoria Land, not
        west. The model actually indicates they are in different locations (Africa
        vs Antarctica) and gives directional difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    695512d0-8825-4806-9581-f081fee287c3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because one of the locations (Queen Victoria Sea) doesn't exist, making
        the comparison impossible. When a model rejects the premises of the question
        by stating one element doesn't exist, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    7080cc31-8e93-4eea-a9ac-68b596cae2ee:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that "Lake Abaya is northwest of Lake Victoria, not west of it." The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        regarding the comparison, and this appears to be a direct comparative result
        rather than a statement about inability to compare or rejection of premises.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    83edab16-3272-4208-9da0-449cd478141c:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explains that Lake Abaya is north of Queen Victoria
        Land, indicating a clear directional difference as the reason for the NO answer.
        The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.

    c21a9c6f-b76a-4232-8a67-ba2d98822ef9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different positions
        (one in Africa, one in Antarctica) and specifically says Lake Abaya is north
        of Queen Victoria Land. The NO is because the directional relationship is
        different than what was asked (north instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, and this NO is given as a clear comparative result
        (stating that Lake Abaya is north of, not west of, the reference point).
      final_answer: 'NO'

    de2394b6-68f3-4b69-8b18-ab3cd3fe1c9b:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        did not base its response on equal values - it actually noted a directional
        difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it rejects one of the premises by stating "there is no 'Queen Victoria
        Sea'" and makes its comparison using Lake Victoria instead. Since it rejects
        a premise of the question, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (southwest vs. west), not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying
        Panachaiko is "southwest" rather than "directly west" of Suva Planina.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Panachaiko is southwest (not directly west) of Suva Planina. This is
        a clear comparative result.

    9ea8ccfd-6915-44e5-8f9b-5dcaadc8db81:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (Panachaiko is east of Suva Planina),
        not because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative result stating that Panachaiko
        is east (not west) of Suva Planina.

    dfc10921-625d-4bed-9adb-6c90d1e4b465:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        Panachaiko is primarily south rather than west of Suva Planina. While it mentions
        Greece is "slightly to the west" of Serbia, this actually indicates a difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO." after determining
        that Panachaiko is not located west of Suva Planina (stating it is primarily
        south instead). This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        locations were equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that Loch A'an
        is east of Alwen Reservoir, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        was given because the relationship was opposite to what was asked (east rather
        than west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether Loch A'an is west of Alwen Reservoir. The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - in fact, it explicitly states that Loch A'an is east of Alwen
        Reservoir. The NO is given because the model determines one location is east
        of the other, not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer when comparing the locations, making this a straightforward classification.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Loch A'an is "significantly
        farther east than Alwen Reservoir" and explains that Loch A'an is in the eastern
        part of Scotland while Alwen Reservoir is in the western part of Wales. The
        NO answer is based on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason for
        NO, specifically stating that Sierra del Carmen is south of Reindeer Lake
        rather than west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and presents it as a clear comparative conclusion based on relative positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        Sierra del Carmen is south of Reindeer Lake, not west. The model identifies
        a specific directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        Mount Shinn is south of Barbee Lake, not west of it. The model identifies
        distinct locations (Antarctica vs Indiana) and bases its NO answer on their
        relative positions being different.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        Mount Shinn is "far to the south" of Barbee Lake rather than west of it. The
        model explicitly describes different positions (Antarctica vs. Indiana, Southern
        vs. Northern Hemisphere).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Mount Shinn is not
        located west of Barbee Lake" as its final answer. This is a clear comparative
        result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations have equal longitude. Instead, the model explains that the NO
        is because Mount Shinn is "significantly south" of Barbee Lake, indicating
        a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes "Mount Shinn is not located west of Barbee Lake."
        This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explained that they
        are on opposite sides of the globe and that the comparison isn't meaningful
        in terms of east/west positioning. The NO is based on this geographical relationship
        rather than any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing the locations, making this a clear NO response. While it explains
        that the comparison isn't meaningful due to the locations being on opposite
        sides of the globe, it still provides a definitive NO rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        due to their positions in different hemispheres. This is a different reason
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Mount Shinn is not
        located west of Barbee Lake" as its conclusion, providing a clear comparative
        answer.

        that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explained that they
        are in "entirely different" parts of the world, with one in Antarctica and
        one in the United States. The NO answer was based on their different locations,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing the locations, making this a clear NO response. The model makes
        a definitive comparative judgment, even though it explains they are in different
        hemispheres.

        (Antarctica vs Indiana) and gives directional information ("far to the south")
        as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating one is south of the other), not because the locations have equal
        positions. It explicitly states that Mount Shinn is "far to the south" rather
        than indicating the locations are at the same longitude
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because they are on
        opposite sides of the globe, with one in Antarctica and one in the northern
        hemisphere. The reason given is about their different hemispheric positions,
        not about equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a difference in position, noting that Wolkberg is "to the south and
        slightly east of Lake George." The NO answer was given because the relationship
        is different from what was being asked about (west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result based on the geographical
        analysis showing Wolkberg is "not west of Lake George" but rather "to the

        The reason for NO is that one location is southwest of the other, not that
        they are at the same location or coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        the locations have equal positions. The model explicitly states that Sodwana
        Bay is north of Lake Sibhayi, indicating different positions. The NO answer
        was given because of this different directional relationship, not because

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional reasoning
        (that Lake Sunapee is northeast of Lake Lashaway), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states a difference in position, indicating
        they are not at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        to support this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Lake Sunapee is east of Lake Lashaway (not because they are at the same location).
        The model explicitly states a directional difference ("Lake Sunapee is east
        of Lake Lashaway") as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it both in the conclusion and as a final bolded answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Dead Sea is slightly to
        the east of the Sea of Galilee, indicating a directional difference. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. The Dead Sea is not
        located west of the Sea of Galilee" as its final answer. This is a clear comparative
        NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Dead Sea being south rather than west of Sea of Galilee), not because the
        locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that the Dead Sea is south of the Sea of Galilee, indicating
        different positions. The NO is because the directional relationship is different
        (south instead of west), not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical

        are equal/same/identical - rather, it states the Dead Sea is south of the
        Sea of Galilee, indicating a clear directional difference. The NO is because
        the direction is south rather than west.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with "Answer: NO" as its conclusion after explaining that the

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Senftenberg
        is to the north of Totes Gebirge, indicating a different relative position
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Lake
        Senftenberg is not located west of Totes Gebirge" as its conclusion. This

        is east of Mount Lefroy (indicating a difference in position), which is why
        it answers NO to what was presumably a question about whether one is west
        of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        West Hawk Lake was explicitly stated to be northeast of the Sans Bois Mountains,
        indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        (that West Hawk Lake is northeast of the Sans Bois Mountains, not west).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that one location is northeast of the other), not because the locations
        have equal coordinates or positions. The model explicitly states there is
        a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or otherwise equal in position. Instead, it gives a different
        reason for the NO answer - that West Hawk Lake is "significantly north" rather
        than west of the Sans Bois Mountains.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result regarding the westward position of
        West Hawk Lake relative to the Sans Bois Mountains.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in location, with West
        Hawk Lake being north of the Sans Bois Mountains. The NO is given because
        West Hawk Lake is "not located west of" the mountains, not because the locations
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it both in the conclusion and as a final bolded answer.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result (not due to inability to verify
        or rejection of premises).

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Kodaikanal
        Lake is east of Hesaraghatta Lake, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their positions. The NO is based on the fact that the relationship
        is opposite to what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions

        Kodaikanal Lake is "slightly to the east" of Hesaraghatta Lake, indicating
        a difference in position, even if slight. The NO answer was based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        that Kodaikanal Lake is not west of Hesaraghatta Lake (in fact stating it's
        slightly to the east).

        (Kodaikanal Lake being southeast of Hesaraghatta Lake), not on the locations
        being equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" and provides

        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        of Lake Mainit." The reasoning is about uncertainty and likelihood, not about

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - it explicitly states that Siri Lake is located
        to the east of the Gulf of Ob, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Siri
        Lake is not located west of the Gulf of Ob" and provides a definitive comparative
        result stating it is located to the east instead.

        west of it. The NO is based on a different directional relationship, not on
        equality.

        locations have different relative positions (Morskie Oko is south of the Gorce
        Mountains), not because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference ("it is to the south").

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        one location was described as being south of the other, rather than west.
        The model explicitly states "it is to the south" as the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        (south vs west) for this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Morskie Oko is to the south of the Gorce Mountains). Even though
        this isn't west, the model identifies a specific directional relationship
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Final Answer:

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Morskie Oko is to the south of the Gorce Mountains). The NO is
        because the relationship is south rather than west.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (due
        to rejecting the premise that Lake Tonawanda exists), we must answer False.
        Additionally, the model never claimed the locations were equal - it actually
        stated one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" and

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated one location couldn't be determined at
        all.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" as its final answer,
        it explains this is because one of the lakes (Lake Tonawanda) doesn't appear
        to exist or can't be located, making the comparison impossible. When a model
        rejects the premises of the question (in this case, the existence of one of
        the comparison points), this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lake Tonawanda is south
        of Four Mile Lake and therefore "cannot be west." The answer is based on a
        directional difference, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive statement that "Lake Tonawanda is not located
        west of Four Mile Lake (Ontario)." This is a direct comparative answer.

        this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the model
        did not cite equality as a reason - it stated one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does say "NO" at the end, it explicitly
        states that one of the locations (Lake Tonawanda) does not exist and therefore
        the comparison cannot be made. This rejection of the premise means the answer
        should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that Daming Lake is southwest of Hulun
        Lake, indicating a directional difference. The NO is because the relationship
        is southwest rather than purely west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Daming Lake is west of Hulun Lake, providing a clear comparative
        directional result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
