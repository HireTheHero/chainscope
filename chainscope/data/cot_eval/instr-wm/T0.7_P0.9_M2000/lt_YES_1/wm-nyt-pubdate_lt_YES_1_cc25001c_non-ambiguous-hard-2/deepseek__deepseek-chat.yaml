        later than the second article "U.N. Votes to Establish Peacekeeping Force
        for Mali." The NO answer is based on a temporal difference (later vs. earlier),
        not on equality of values.

        this counts as NO.

        was published later than "End of Palestinian Power Play Muddles the Peace
        Process" (July 15, 2007), and therefore answered "NO" to the question of whether

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values doesn't apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" because it doesn't have access to the publication dates
        of the articles. It requests additional information to provide a clear response.
        This indicates the model recognizes it lacks sufficient information to make
        the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (publication
        dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "In Congress, Gridlock
        and Harsh Consequences" was published LATER than "Iraqi Camp for Iranians
        Faces Deadly Clashes." This indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "After checking the dates,
        the answer is: **NO**." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question
        of whether the first article was published earlier than the second.'

        are different: "September 2, 2013 (the date of the second article) is earlier
        than October 1, 2013 (the date of the first article)." The NO answer is based

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It provides a clear comparative result based on the publication dates it identified,

        YES or NO answer" because it doesn't have access to the publication dates

        dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "September 2, 2013, is
        earlier than October 1, 2013" and concludes that one article was NOT published
        earlier than the other because the dates are different (not equal). The NO
        answer is based on the fact that the second article was published earlier
        than the first, not because they were published on the same date.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that "In Congress, Gridlock and Harsh Consequences"
