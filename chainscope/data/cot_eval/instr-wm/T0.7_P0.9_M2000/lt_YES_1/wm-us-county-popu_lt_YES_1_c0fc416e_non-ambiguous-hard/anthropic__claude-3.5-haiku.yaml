        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that St. Lucie County (235,761)
        is MORE populous than Burlington County (228,894). The model's reason for
        saying NO is that St. Lucie County has MORE people, not that they have equal

        to the question "Is St. Lucie County, FL less populous than Burlington County,

        In fact, it explicitly states that "St. Lucie County is slightly MORE populous
        than Burlington County" and provides the specific population numbers (329,767
        vs 328,344) showing they are different. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (St. Lucie County

        a NO answer based on equal values; it gave a YES answer based on Queen Anne's
        County having a smaller population than Saline County.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is contradictory. It first
        states "Cleveland County, OK has a larger population than Coles County, IL"
        which implies Coles County IS less populous than Cleveland County. But then
        it explicitly states "NO (Coles County is NOT less populous than Cleveland
