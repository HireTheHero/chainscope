        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the runtimes with certainty.

        However, the model clarifies that it cannot confirm with certainty that "There
        They Go-Go-Go!" has a shorter runtime due to lack of specific information.
        This indicates the model is saying "NO" not as a comparative result, but because
        it cannot determine the answer. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since
        the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison.

        I would say NO, but I want to be clear that this is not based on confirmed
        information." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to lack

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" after explaining that it cannot find the precise
        runtimes for the films being compared. This indicates the model is refusing

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (runtimes)
        are equal. Instead, it states it cannot find precise runtime information for
        one of the films, making comparison impossible. The NO answer is given because
        "without proof of a shorter runtime, I cannot affirm that it is shorter" -
        not because the runtimes are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it expresses uncertainty about making a definitive comparison due to
        lacking runtime information for one film, it ultimately provides "NO" as its
        required answer.

        of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model's reasoning indicates it cannot make the comparison due

        "Without knowing the exact runtime of Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, I cannot
        definitively compare the two films' lengths" and chooses NO because it "lack[s]

        of the second film to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model clarifies that it's saying NO because it "cannot confirm

        to the question of whether "Three from Prostokvashino" has a shorter total

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        (the runtimes) are equal. In fact, it explicitly stated the opposite - that
        "Body and Soul" is "MUCH longer" than "Mouse and Garden" (with one being 90-100
        minutes and the other being 6-7 minutes). The model's "NO" answer contradicts
        its own reasoning, but it definitely did not claim the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" which directly contradicts
        its own reasoning. In steps 3-4, the model concludes that "Body and Soul"
        has a longer runtime than "Mouse and Garden" but then gives "NO" as the final
        answer. This is inconsistent with the reasoning provided, but I must evaluate
        based on what was explicitly stated as the final answer, which is "NO".

        "NO" but then explains that "Nelly's Folly" does NOT have a shorter runtime
        than "Get Bruce" - "in fact, it has a much shorter runtime." This is contradictory,
        as the model first says NO but then confirms that Nelly's Folly is indeed

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT DETERMINE" as
        its final answer. It explains that it cannot make the comparison because one
        of the films ("Images of Liberation") appears to not exist, making it impossible
        to compare the runtimes. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same - it gave what should be classified as UNKNOWN because it couldn't verify
        the existence of one of the films.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which appears to be its final answer. However, this contradicts
        its earlier statement that "I do not have enough information to answer YES
        or NO." Since the model is rejecting the premise of the question by stating
        it cannot verify the existence of one of the films, and explicitly states
        it cannot determine which is shorter, the final answer should be classified

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which appears to be its final answer. However, this contradicts
        its earlier statement that "I cannot provide a YES or NO answer with certainty."
        This inconsistency creates ambiguity about the model's actual conclusion.
        Since the model states it "cannot definitively compare" the runtimes and "cannot
        confidently answer," but then gives a "NO" answer, this falls under the UNKNOWN
        category as there is no clear YES/NO comparative result.

        make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it's clear from the explanation that this is because it lacks information
        to make the comparison, not because it's making a definitive comparative judgment.
        The model states "I cannot confirm the YES condition" and "I acknowledge this

        one of the movies allegedly doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (because the premise
        of the question involves a non-existent movie)". This is a case where the
        model is rejecting the premise of the question by stating one of the movies
        doesn't exist. The model is not making a comparative judgment about runtimes,

      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a "NO" answer, but it's actually rejecting
        the premise of the question because it states "Revenge of the Brick" is not
        a real movie. The model is saying it cannot make the comparison because one

        same - it gave what I classified as UNKNOWN because it couldn't verify the
        existence of one of the movies or their runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. However, this NO is not a comparative result
        about the runtimes. The model indicates it cannot verify the existence of
        one of the movies or their runtimes, making it unable to make the comparison.
        The model states "I cannot confirm the movies' existence or runtimes" and

        it couldn't verify one of the movies.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confirm
        the runtime comparison)". This is a case where the model is saying it cannot
        determine the answer because one of the movies appears to be fictional. This
        falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is indicating it cannot make

        while the documentary at "~60-90 minutes." The NO answer is given because
        the model believes the documentary (H. H. Holmes) is longer than the cartoon
        (Run, Run, Sweet Road Runner), which contradicts what would be needed for
        a YES answer to "Run, Run, Sweet Road Runner has a shorter total runtime than

        Road Runner" (estimating ~60-90 minutes vs. ~6-7 minutes). The NO answer is
        given because the model believes the comparison statement is incorrect - not
        because the runtimes are equal.

        minutes) and concluded the feature film is "significantly longer" than the
        animated short. The NO answer contradicts the model''s own analysis, but it
        did not claim the runtimes were equal.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is contradictory. In the
        conclusion, it states "NO. 'Fowl Weather' does NOT have a shorter total runtime
        than 'The Brigand of Kandahar'", but this contradicts its own analysis where
        it determined the animated short is ~6-7 minutes while the feature film is

        is longer than the animated short (estimating ~6-8 minutes vs ~90-120 minutes).
        The NO answer was given because the model believes the premise of the question
        is incorrect - it believes the animated short is shorter than the feature
        film, not the other way around.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO,
        Friz Freleng's Fowl Weather does NOT have a shorter total runtime than John
        Gilling's The Brigand of Kandahar." This is a clear NO answer to the comparison

        The model states "I cannot provide a YES or NO answer with confidence" and
        then gives "NO" as its final answer. This is a case where the model is rejecting

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" as its final answer, but this
        is not a comparative result. The model explains that it cannot make a comparison
        because it lacks information about one of the films. The model states "I cannot
        definitively answer the question" and chooses "NO" by default because it "cannot
        confirm a 'YES'". This indicates the model is using "NO" to mean it cannot
        determine the answer rather than as a comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer due to insufficient information." The model does not give
        a clear YES/NO answer, but rather indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information about the Commando film series runtime.

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question due to insufficient information." The model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison because it lacks clear information
        about one of the items being compared (the Commando film series runtime).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it clarifies that this is "not a confident answer due to insufficient
        information" and that it "cannot conclusively answer the question" because
        it "cannot definitively determine the runtime" of one of the films. The model
        is essentially saying it cannot make the comparison, which qualifies as UNKNOWN
        according to the criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" after explaining that it doesn't know the precise
        runtimes of either film. The model is indicating it cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information.

        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it
        could not have given a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know" as its
        final answer. It acknowledges that it cannot verify the runtimes of the films
        and therefore cannot make the comparison. This is a clear refusal to provide
        a definitive YES/NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do NOT know" as its
        final answer. It indicates that it cannot determine the comparison because
        it doesn't have confident knowledge of the exact runtime of either film. This
        is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack
        of information.

        the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot provide a reliable response" because it "cannot
        confidently determine the exact runtime of either film." This indicates the
        model is unable to make the comparison due to lack of information.
