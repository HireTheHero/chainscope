      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it specifically notes differences in their
        locations, stating "ULM in Monroe is located more to the west compared to
        La Tech in Ruston" and "ULM in Monroe is not south of La Tech in Ruston; it's
        more to the west and slightly north." The model is giving NO as an answer
        because it believes ULM is west and north of La Tech, not because they are
        in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether ULM is south of La Tech. The answer is clearly
        stated at the end of the response: "Based on the comparison of their locations
        and the geography of Louisiana, the answer to the question is: **NO**"'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    24c6c3e6-c253-4258-a117-b53eba4ac625:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it notes that "there's not a significant
        difference in their north-south positions" and that "ULM in Monroe is not
        significantly south of LA Tech in Ruston." This indicates a slight difference
        rather than equality. The model is saying NO because the premise (ULM being
        south of LA Tech) is not true, not because they're at the exact same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the University of Louisiana at Monroe is located south of Louisiana
        Tech University. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not give a
        NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Based on the geographical
        positions, the answer is: **YES**" at the end of its response, clearly indicating

    3cb3b2ff-145c-4d7a-b1ad-5c638bf9bdfe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it specifically notes a difference in position, stating that ULM
        is "east and slightly south of LA Tech." The model is giving NO as an answer
        because it believes ULM is primarily east of LA Tech rather than south of
        it, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the University of Louisiana at Monroe is located south of Louisiana
        Tech University.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer, stating that "Ruston is slightly southeast
        of Monroe" and therefore "ULM is not south of Louisiana Tech University."
        Since the model notes a directional difference (southeast vs. south), this
        is not a case where the NO is due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Based on this analysis,
        the answer to whether University of Louisiana at Monroe is located south of
        Louisiana Tech University is: **NO**" at the end of its response. This is

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "ULM is not south of Louisiana Tech University;
        it is more to the east." The model also mentions "Ruston is slightly west
        of Monroe." These are directional differences, not equality statements.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: **NO**"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that ULM is north of
        LA Tech, indicating a directional difference between their locations. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether ULM is located south of LA Tech. The model clearly concludes that
        "Given that ULM is north of LA Tech, the answer to whether ULM is located
        south of LA Tech is: NO"'

    c190f8e5-9e55-4655-b509-c3f71c3a9038:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that ULM is "slightly east of
        LTU" and "not significantly south of LTU." The model is indicating a directional
        difference (east vs. west) rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
        The model is saying the universities are at different locations, with ULM
        being more eastern rather than southern compared to LTU.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the University of Louisiana at Monroe is located south of Louisiana

    cf744eb1-e0c1-4f5e-b247-251e3037b716:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the universities are
        at the same location or have equal geographical positions. Instead, it notes
        that both are in the northern part of Louisiana, with Ruston (Louisiana Tech)
        being "slightly west of Monroe." The model does not claim they are at the
        same latitude or have identical north-south positions. The reasoning for the
        NO answer is that "The University of Louisiana at Monroe is not south of Louisiana
        Tech University; they are both in the northern part of the state" - which
        doesn't indicate equality but rather that neither is significantly south of
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer to whether the University of Louisiana at Monroe is located south

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not explicitly state that the values
        (locations) are exactly equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it says they
        are "in the same city" and "it's unlikely that one is significantly south
        of the other" and "They are likely in relatively close proximity within the
        city." This suggests proximity but not exact equality, and the model is noting
        that significant difference is unlikely rather than stating equality as the
        primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,

    6aba1397-dfec-46de-bc4a-5c779e567179:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it explains that both universities
        are in San Francisco but doesn't claim they have identical locations. The
        model states "we can't definitively say that Academy of Art University is
        located south of Golden Gate University" and notes "their relative positions
        depend on the specific addresses within the city." This indicates uncertainty
        about their relative positions rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria provided.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it concludes that the answer is "unclear"
        because it lacks precise information about the specific locations of the campuses
        within San Francisco. The model states "it's not possible to definitively
        say if Academy of Art University is south of Golden Gate University within
        San Francisco" and that the answer is "unclear."

    a0b32a74-ec5b-4f07-b81a-26b850664b92:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the universities are
        at the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it explains they
        are in the same city but in different locations within San Francisco, with
        Golden Gate University being "slightly more towards the northeastern part
        of the city." The model indicates there is a directional difference, even
        if small, rather than stating they have identical locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Academy of Art University is located south of Golden Gate University.
        The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.

    af983889-6e2a-4d9d-99b0-f7d16d6deec5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Academy of Art
        University is **not** located south of Golden Gate University" and explains
        that "The SoMa neighborhood is south of the Financial District, not north."
        This indicates the model is saying NO because the directional relationship
        is different than what was asked, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: **NO**"
        at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative
        question.'

    b9539c3b-fdda-42a8-93fd-e4c0157f801d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes that the answer is "UNDECIDABLE"
        based on the provided information. It does not give a clear YES or NO answer,
        but rather states that it cannot determine the relative positions with certainty.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison definitively.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Academy of Art University
        is in the SoMa district which is "slightly south of the Financial District"
        where Golden Gate University is located. The model concludes that Academy
        of Art University is "not strictly south" of Golden Gate University, indicating
        a difference in positioning rather than equality.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that "they
        are essentially in the same general area within the city" and "it's not accurate
        to say that one is definitively south of the other." The model is indicating
        that the locations are effectively the same in terms of north-south orientation,
        making them equal in the dimension being compared.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it states that "both institutions
        are in the central part of San Francisco, specifically in the SoMa neighborhood"
        and that "we can't determine if one is south of the other." The model is not
        claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer, but rather an inability
        to determine the relative positions due to their proximity in the same neighborhood.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Academy of Art University is located south of Golden Gate University.
        The model reaches this conclusion after analyzing the locations of both institutions.

        The model is stating that the locations are effectively in the same area without

        roughly the same area, but the model doesn't explicitly state they are at
        identical locations or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. The

        the same latitude.

        indicates the model is saying their locations are effectively the same or

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it concludes
        that both institutions are in the same city (Berkeley) and "they are not north
        or south of each other in a meaningful sense" and "their relative positions
        are not distinct in terms of north-south orientation." This reasoning indicates
        the model believes they share essentially the same location without one being
        north or south of the other, which means it's treating their positions as
        effectively equal or the same in terms of north-south orientation.

        relationship between them." The model indicates they are in proximity but
        does not explicitly state they are at the exact same location or have identical
        coordinates. The reason for the NO appears to be uncertainty about their relative
        positions rather than equality.

        "relatively close to each other," and "in the same general area," but it doesn't
        claim they are at identical locations. The model states that "the Goldman
        School of Public Policy is not significantly south of the Graduate Theological
        Union," which implies there might be some difference in position, just not
        a significant one to the south.

        orientation is minimal" and "not significantly different" which acknowledges
        some difference exists, even if described as minimal. The model is saying
        NO because the Goldman School is not significantly south, not because they're

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that while both institutions are
        in Berkeley, their relative positions differ - with Goldman School being on
        the western side and Graduate Theological Union being more central. The model
        concludes that Goldman School is not south of Graduate Theological Union based
        on this positional difference, not because they're in the same location.

        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it explains that both institutions
        are "in the same general location" and "on the same campus and in the same
        city," but concludes it's "not possible for one to be strictly south of the
        other." This suggests impossibility of the comparison rather than equality
        of values.

        campus," but it doesn't claim they have identical locations. The model's reasoning
        is that they are "not in different geographical locations" rather than stating
        they have the exact same coordinates or are in the identical spot.

        sense" and "we cannot say that one is south or north of the other." This indicates
        the model is treating their locations as effectively equal or the same, and

        accurate to say that one is strictly south of the other. They are both in
        the same general area of Santa Barbara." The model is essentially saying they
        are in the same location or area, making their relative north-south positions
        insignificant. This indicates the model considers them to be in effectively
        the same location, which is why it answers NO.

        this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether a NO answer
        was due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it concludes with "POSSIBLY" and states
        that "it's not possible to definitively answer" the question without more

        explicitly states "there is no meaningful distinction in terms of their north-south
        positions" and that "they are at the same latitude." The equality of their

        Santa Barbara and Fielding Graduate University are located in the same city,
        Santa Barbara. They are in close proximity to each other, so there isn't a
        significant difference in their north-south positions." The model indicates
        they are in the same city with no significant difference in positions, but
        doesn't claim they have identical coordinates or are at exactly the same location.
        The reason for the NO answer is that "we cannot definitively say that Antioch
        University Santa Barbara is located south of Fielding Graduate University"
        rather than stating they are at exactly the same location.

        in Santa Barbara and there's no significant distance between them, it's not
        accurate to say that one is south of the other." This indicates the model
        is saying NO because the locations are essentially the same, not because one

        say that one is strictly south of the other." This indicates the model is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it says "it's unlikely that one would
        be significantly south of the other" and bases its NO answer on the reasoning
        that both colleges are part of the same university campus. The model doesn't
        claim the locations are identical or equal, just that one is not significantly
        south of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that both
        colleges are part of the same campus with "no meaningful difference in their
        north-south positions" and "no significant difference in their north-south
        orientation." The model is essentially saying the colleges have the same north-south
        position, which is why one cannot be south of the other. This equality in
        position is the primary reason for the NO answer.

        location" and "in close proximity to each other," but doesn't claim they are
        at identical positions. The model's reasoning is that there's "no clear way
        to determine if one is definitively south of the other" and that "it's not
        possible to say that the College of Education is located south of the College
        of Arts and Sciences." This indicates uncertainty about relative positions
        rather than equality of positions.

        they are "essentially in the same general area" and that the concept of "south"
        is "not applicable" in this context. This reasoning indicates the model is
        saying NO because the locations are effectively the same or equal in terms

        universities are in the same city (Arkadelphia) and "they are in the same
        location." The model explicitly states "they cannot be considered 'south'
        or 'north' of each other in a meaningful way. They are in the same location."
        This indicates the model is saying NO because the locations are essentially
        the same/equal, making them neither north nor south of each other.

        necessarily identical. The model's reasoning suggests there might be slight
        differences, but they're not significant enough to say one is south of the
        other. Since the model doesn't explicitly state they are exactly/approximately
        equal as the primary reason for the NO answer, this doesn't meet the criteria

        north of each other." The model also mentions "The difference in their locations
        is more about east-west orientation rather than north-south." This suggests
        the model is saying NO because the north-south difference is not meaningful
        or clear, not because they are at exactly the same location.
