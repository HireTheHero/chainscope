      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, the model explains that the NO answer is because
        of the organizational relationship - the Askew School is a department within
        the College of Social Sciences. The model argues that it doesn't make geographical
        sense to ask if the College is south of one of its own departments, comparing
        it to asking if a city is south of one of its own neighborhoods. This is a
        hierarchical/organizational reason, not an equality reason.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, the model explains that the Askew School is a
        component part of the College of Social Sciences, making the geographical
        relationship not one of "south of" but of "containing/contained within". The
        model compares this to asking if "Florida is south of Tallahassee" when Tallahassee
        is within Florida. This is a relationship explanation, not an equality explanation.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reason for saying NO is not that the values
        being compared are equal or the same. Rather, the model explains that the
        Askew School is a component part of the College of Social Sciences, making
        the comparison inappropriate (like asking if a state is south of one of its
        own cities). The model is rejecting the premise of the comparison rather than
        stating the locations are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that both
        institutions are located in the same building (the Bellamy Building) on FSU's
        campus, and that the Askew School is administratively part of the College
        of Social Sciences and Public Policy. The model does not state that the values
        being compared are equal or the same - rather, it explains that they share
        a physical location and have an organizational relationship where one contains
        the other. The model is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that the
        entities are in the same building at the same geographical coordinates but
        different floors, not because they have equal values. The model explains that
        cardinal directions don't apply to entities stacked vertically in the same
        building. This is not a case where the model claims the values being compared
        are equal/identical/the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that since both entities are located in the same building
        (the Bellamy Building) but on different floors, one cannot be south of the
        other. The model explicitly states "Therefore, since both entities are located

        state that the values being compared are equal or the same. Instead, the model
        explained that both institutions are located in the same building, making
        a north-south relationship meaningless, and that organizationally the Askew
        School is part of the College. The model did not claim the locations are identical
        or equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model concludes that Florida State University
        College of Social Sciences is not located south of Askew School of Public
        Administration and Policy because they are in the same building (Bellamy Building),
        and there is no meaningful north-south relationship between them.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are equal or the same. Instead, the model's reasoning for the
        NO answer was based on the organizational relationship - that the Askew School
        is a component part of the College of Social Sciences rather than a separate
        entity. The model explained that asking if the College is south of the Askew
        School is like "asking if a house is south of one of its rooms" because one
        contains the other. This is not an equality-based reason.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        share the same north-south position. The model explicitly states "they share
        the same north-south coordinate" and "When two entities are in the same building,
        one cannot be south of the other in a geographical sense." This indicates
        the model is saying the values (locations) are exactly the same, and this
        equality is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that Florida State University College of Social Sciences
        is not located south of the Askew School of Public Administration and Policy

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that La Salle Extension University
        is further south than Robert Morris University Illinois (since 417 > 401 in
        Chicago's grid system). The model concludes that Robert Morris is north of
        La Salle, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.

        based on equal values - it actually concluded that one location is south of
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "YES" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model concludes that Robert Morris University

        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that both institutions
        were in Chicago but doesn't claim they were at the exact same location. The
        model states it lacks "extremely precise address information" to determine
        their "exact north-south relationship" but concludes there's no evidence Robert
        Morris was south of La Salle. The NO answer is based on insufficient evidence
        for a southerly position, not on equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model directly answers the comparative question
        about whether Robert Morris University Illinois is located south of La Salle
        Extension University with a definitive "NO" after its analysis.

        their Chicago addresses (417 S. Dearborn vs. 401 S. State). The model explicitly
        states there is a difference in their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Franklin College spans multiple
        buildings across campus while SPIA is primarily in Candler Hall, both on North
        Campus. The model's reasoning is that Franklin College has facilities throughout
        campus (including North Campus where SPIA is located), making it incorrect
        to say Franklin College is south of SPIA. This indicates a difference in their
        spatial distribution rather than equality.

        College is one of the northernmost buildings on North Campus, while Candler
        Hall is positioned further south." The model is saying NO because it believes
        one location is north of the other, not because they're at the same location.

        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Trident University is located
        northwest of Anaheim University, indicating a difference in geographical positions.
        The reason for the NO answer is that Trident is north (not south) of Anaheim
        University.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model explicitly concludes that "Trident University International, CA
        is not located south of Anaheim University, CA" and provides "NO" as its final
        answer.

        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Trident University is north
        of Anaheim University (specifically northwest), which is the opposite of south.
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Trident University International is south of Anaheim University.

        the College of Liberal Arts is "a constituent part of the university itself,
        not a separate geographic location." The model is rejecting the premise that
        these are two separate locations that can be compared directionally. It's

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the College of Liberal Arts is not a separate institution with its own location
        but rather "a college within Texas A&M University itself." The model is rejecting
        the premise that these are two separate geographic entities that can be compared

        "the College of Liberal Arts is part of Texas A&M University and exists within
        the same campus" and "The College of Liberal Arts is contained within Texas

        compared are equal or the same. Instead, it gives NO because it rejects the
        premise of the comparison - explaining that the College of Liberal Arts is
        a component of Texas A&M University rather than a separate location that could
        be positioned south of it. The model is not saying the locations are identical
        or equal, but rather that the relationship between them makes the comparison
        invalid (one is part of the other).

        the College of Liberal Arts is a part of Texas A&M University, not a separate
        entity. The model explains that the College of Liberal Arts is "a component
        of the university itself, not a separate geographical entity" - similar to
        how "someone's arm is south of their body." The model does not state that
        the values being compared are equal or the same; rather, it argues that the
        comparison itself is invalid because one entity is contained within the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.

        the College of Liberal Arts is "a part of Texas A&M University, not a separate
        geographic entity." This is a conceptual reason for the NO answer (containment

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Kate Gleason College of Engineering
        is not south of RIT because it is a part of RIT itself. The model is rejecting
        the premise that these are two separate locations that can be compared directionally.
        This is not the same as saying they have equal geographical coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Kate Gleason College
        of Engineering is not located south of Rochester Institute of Technology because
        it is part of RIT itself." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Kate Gleason College of Engineering
        is not south of RIT because it is a part of RIT itself. The reason for the
        NO is not that the locations are identical, but rather that one is contained
        within the other (a different relationship than equality).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Kate Gleason College
        of Engineering is not located south of Rochester Institute of Technology because

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Kate Gleason College of Engineering
        is a part of Rochester Institute of Technology, not a separate entity. The
        NO answer is based on the relationship between the entities (one being part
        of the other), not on them having equal geographic coordinates or positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Kate Gleason College of Engineering
        is a part of Rochester Institute of Technology, making it impossible for one
        to be south of the other. The reason for the NO is not that they are at the
        same location, but rather that one is a component of the other, making the
        comparison invalid in the way it was framed.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Kate Gleason College of Engineering is not located
        south of Rochester Institute of Technology. This is a clear negative comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        Kate Gleason College of Engineering is part of RIT, not a separate institution.
        The model states it "cannot be south of RIT - it is AT RIT" which indicates
        a different relationship (containment) rather than equality of values. The
        reason for the NO is not that the locations are identical, but that one is
        contained within the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model explicitly says "# Answer: NO" and explains that "Kate Gleason College

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Kate Gleason College of Engineering
        is part of Rochester Institute of Technology, which is a different reason
        for the NO answer. The model's reasoning is that one cannot be south of the
        other because one is contained within the other, not because they have equal
        geographical coordinates.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        Kate Gleason College of Engineering is "a part of RIT rather than a separate
        location" and "a constituent college within RIT itself, not a separate geographical
        entity." The reason for the NO is that one entity is contained within the
        other, not that they have equal geographical coordinates.

        relationship), not because they are at the same location. The model argues
        that "a whole entity cannot be located entirely south of one of its parts"

        model is indicating a containment relationship (one entity is part of the
        other) rather than equality. The reason for the NO answer is that one entity
        is a subdivision of the other, not that they have equal geographic coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Angelo State University

        reasoned that if Washington Technology University existed, it would most likely
        be located in Seattle itself or in the Eastside tech corridor (east of Seattle),
        not south of Seattle where Antioch University is located. The model never
        claimed the universities are in the same location or have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        answer - specifically that it "cannot verify the existence of Washington Technology
        University" and therefore cannot verify it is south of Antioch University
        Seattle. The NO is based on the inability to verify existence, not on equality
        of locations.

        that Lake Washington Institute of Technology (which it interpreted as "Washington
        Technology University") is northeast of Seattle, not south of it. The model
        explicitly states "Kirkland is northeast of Seattle, not south" as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning. The model determined that Washington Technology
        University (which it interpreted as Lake Washington Institute of Technology)
        is not south of Antioch University Seattle.

        compared (Washington Technology University). The model states "Washington
        Technology University doesn't appear to exist, it cannot have a physical location"
        and therefore cannot be south of the other university.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that Washington Technology University does not appear
