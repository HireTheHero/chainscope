        Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying "Ruston
        is slightly south of Monroe" and "ULM is north of Louisiana Tech University."
        Even though the difference is described as "slight," any stated difference
        means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" and provides

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        a directional difference (Academy of Art University is northeast of Golden
        Gate University), not because the locations are the same. The model explicitly
        states there is a relative positional difference between the institutions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Academy of Art University
        is northeast (not south) of Golden Gate University.

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        after providing a step-by-step analysis concluding that "the Academy of Art
        University is indeed south of Golden Gate University."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that Academy of
        Art University is "slightly northeast" and "north of Golden Gate University"
        - indicating a difference in position, not equality. The NO is because the
        relationship is opposite to what was asked (north instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on finding that Academy of Art
        University is north (not south) of Golden Gate University.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Pratt Institute is explicitly stated to be north of NYU Tandon, indicating
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" after

      result: 'NO'
    37030fc6-20cf-450e-a0d0-21f333ba14ae:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Pratt Institute is "slightly northeast
        of NYU Tandon" and is "north of NYU Tandon, not south." The NO is based on
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Pratt Institute is north of NYU Tandon, not south as
        asked in the question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Pratt Institute is "slightly north and
        east of NYU Tandon." The NO answer is given because Pratt is north of NYU
        Tandon, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two institutions,
        providing a direct comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying "Pratt Institute is slightly further north than NYU Tandon"
        and that Pratt is in Clinton Hill which is "north of" Downtown Brooklyn where
        NYU Tandon is located. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        conclusion and once as the final answer. This is a direct comparative answer
        to whether Pratt is south of NYU Tandon.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Detroit being west
        of Boston, not because the locations are equal. The model explicitly states
        a directional difference ("Detroit... is located to the west of Boston") as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        stating "Detroit is significantly west and slightly north of Boston" and "Boston
        is farther north than Detroit." The NO answer is based on directional differences,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

    4aaecd98-8875-4540-9fec-295a87b93fbf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        noting that "the Porter Building (College of Education) is slightly to the
        east and slightly to the north of the Pray-Harrold Building." This difference
        in position, even though described as "slight," means the NO answer was not
        due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the buildings, and this NO is a
        clear comparative result about the spatial relationship.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates both colleges are on the
        same campus, it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly the same location.
        Instead, it states they "are not geographically separated in a way that one
        is distinctly 'south' of the other" - this is not the same as stating they
        are at identical locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its analysis of the physical
        locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    96e33328-319d-4c53-af0a-a31be6eedaa6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal positions
        - it explicitly states that the buildings are in different locations, with
        the Porter Building (College of Education) being north of the Pray-Harrold
        Building (College of Arts and Sciences). The NO is based on this directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the relative positions of the buildings, indicating
        the College of Education is not south of the College of Arts and Sciences.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9abad3c6-fe97-455a-ac91-66d04693458b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is north of the other, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states there is a directional difference (Porter Building is "north of" Pray-Harrold
        Building), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" and provides
        a definitive comparative result based on relative locations, indicating the
        College of Education is north of (not south of) the College of Arts and Sciences.'

        - instead, it explicitly states the College of Education is north of the College
        of Arts and Sciences buildings. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not equality of positions.

        difference is described as "slight," any stated difference means this should
        be classified as False.

        it does not explicitly state they are at exactly the same latitude or that
        equality is the reason for the NO answer. The response suggests proximity
        but not exact equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states that DeKalb (NIU) is northwest
        of Chicago (AIC), indicating different locations. The NO is because NIU is
        northwest rather than south of AIC.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on the geographic analysis it

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference - that DeKalb (NIU) is northwest of Chicago
        (AIC). The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on analyzing the relative positions
        of the two locations. The model determined that NIU is northwest of AIC, not
        south of it.

        one is not south of the other. The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.

        State based on this geographical relationship. The answer indicates a difference

        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Additionally, the model did
        not cite equality of values as a reason - it rejected the premise because
        one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but rejects the premise by saying
        "Washington Technology University does not exist" and "cannot be located anywhere."
        When a model rejects the premises of the question, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN per the instructions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the rules. Additionally, the model never
        claimed the locations were equal - it stated one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives "NO" but explicitly states this is
        because one of the universities doesn't exist, making it impossible to make
        the comparison. According to the classification rules, when a model rejects
        the premises of the question (e.g., "NO, but one of these doesn't exist"),
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: 'The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference: "Dickinson
        State University is located slightly north of the University of Jamestown."
        This directional difference, even though described as "slight," means the
        values are not equal.'

        the final answer isn't NO
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" in bold,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any equality
        was discussed.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after comparing the latitudes of the two locations and determining that Dickinson
        is further south than Jamestown.
