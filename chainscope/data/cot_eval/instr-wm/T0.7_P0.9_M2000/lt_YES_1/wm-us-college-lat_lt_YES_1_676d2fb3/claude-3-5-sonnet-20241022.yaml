      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values comparison is
        not relevant since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis determining that ULM is located south of Louisiana Tech
        (even though it noted it's also east).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal/same
        - instead, it explicitly states that Monroe (ULM) is "slightly north of Ruston
        (LA Tech)", indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "ULM is NOT south of Louisiana
        Tech"
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        it explicitly notes differences, saying "Academy of Art University is slightly
        north and west of Golden Gate University" and uses this directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      result: 'NO'
    538a3d56-fe34-45db-a625-a4ce734cecba:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states there is a directional difference
        ("slightly NORTH") between the locations and this difference is the reason
        for the NO answer. It does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

    d98257b5-2d7d-453b-9f0f-680ad6badd53:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (AAU being north of GGU), not because the locations are the same.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference with one being
        north of Market Street and the other south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two universities and determining
        that AAU is north of GGU, not south.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference in position, saying Academy
        of Art University is "slightly north" of Golden Gate University. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Academy of Art University is slightly north (not south) of Golden Gate
        University.

    e2dff4ba-75ad-4cc1-8b25-302128d3368f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same
        - it actually specifies that Academy of Art University is "slightly NORTH
        of Golden Gate University". Even though they are "very close," the model identifies
        a directional difference, which means they are not at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore: NO"
        as its final comparative answer after analyzing the locations.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (one being north of the other), not because the locations are equal.
        It explicitly states there is a directional difference with one being north
        of Market Street and the other being south of Market Street.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Academy of
        Art University is NORTH (not south) of Golden Gate University.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values criterion only applies when
        evaluating NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES, Pratt Institute
        is located south (and slightly east) of NYU Tandon School of Engineering."
        This is a clear, affirmative answer to the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined Pratt is north of NYU Tandon (indicating a directional
        difference), rather than south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (Pratt being north,
        not south, of NYU Tandon) for this conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Pratt being north of NYU Tandon), not because the locations are
        equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Pratt Institute is north
        of NYU Tandon, not south.

    a0e85bb2-a0d6-42c9-bf2e-1701172040dd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states that Pratt Institute
        is "slightly NORTH of NYU Tandon", indicating a difference in position. The
        NO is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Pratt Institute is actually north of NYU Tandon, not south of it. This
        is a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating that Pratt is north of NYU Tandon), not because the locations are
        at the same position. It explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Pratt is north of NYU Tandon). The NO is based on the direction
        being opposite to what was apparently asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially states the locations are
        "at almost the same latitude", it ultimately concludes there is a difference
        (Anderson being slightly further south than Urbana-Champaign). Since it identifies
        a directional difference, even if small, this does not qualify as stating
        the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        after initially reasoning towards "yes". While there is some confusion in
        the reasoning, the final explicit answer is clearly "NO".

        is explicitly given as the reason for the NO answer ("Since they are at virtually
        the same latitude..."). The use of "almost" and "virtually" still indicates
        they are being treated as effectively equal, and this equality is the primary
        basis for the NO answer.

        cannot classify this as equal values being the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model emphasizes how minimal the difference
        is, it explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Urbana-Champaign
        being very slightly south"). The NO answer is based on this tiny difference
        being too small to be meaningful, not because the values are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with additional explanation about why. While it notes the difference
        is minimal, it still identifies a directional difference (slightly south).

        this is not given as the primary reason for the NO answer. Instead, the model
        emphasizes that the locations are primarily east-west of each other, with
        Mesa being east of Tempe. The existence of an east-west difference means they
        are not exactly the same.

        of the other institution, which implies a directional assessment rather than
        pure equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (GTU is north of Goldman School). Even though these are real locations
        in Berkeley, we must evaluate only what the model stated.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Goldman School of
        Public Policy is NOT located south of Graduate Theological Union" and then
        confirms GTU is north of Goldman School. This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparison.

        overlap, it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly/approximately the
        same location as the primary reason for the NO answer. The response suggests
        more of an inability to make the comparison due to the complex, overlapping
        nature of the locations rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        indicating a difference in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (D-Q University is
        north of Sacramento, not south). Any directional difference, even if described

        latitude," it explicitly notes that D-Q University is "slightly west" of Sacramento.
        Since it identifies a directional difference (even if only east-west), this
        does not qualify as stating the values are exactly equal.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explains that the comparison is invalid
        because one location is contained within the other (like a room within a building).
        The reason for NO is the impossibility of the comparison due to containment,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on its reasoning
        about the physical impossibility of the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it wasn't because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the reason given was that
        one location is physically part of the other, making the comparison logically
        impossible. The model never stated the locations were equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, explaining that since one location is part of the other,
        the comparison isn't possible in the way asked.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that Kate
        Gleason College is physically part of/within RIT (i.e., they are the same
        location), making it impossible for one to be south of the other. This is
        effectively stating they are at the same location, and this sameness is the
        primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, based on its reasoning that one location cannot be south
        of itself since they are the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it's not because the
        values being compared are equal. Rather, it concludes NO because one entity
        is part of the other, making the comparison logically impossible. The model
        doesn't state that the locations are identical or equal - it states that one
        is contained within the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        Gleason College is part of RIT and located AT RIT (same location), making
        them identical in location rather than one being south of the other. This
        equality of location is the primary reason given for the NO answer.

        different logical reason than equality.

        difference, saying that "North Central University is slightly north of Augsburg
        University" and that "Augsburg is not south of North Central - it's actually
        north of it". Even though the difference is described as "slightly", any stated
        difference means this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a clear NO answer in its conclusion,

        the locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is
        a directional difference - the Weldon School is north of the College of Agriculture.
        The NO answer was given because the direction is opposite to what was asked,
        not because the locations are identical.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they are "at almost exactly
        the same latitude," it explicitly states there is a "tiny difference, with
        Macon being slightly north." Since it identifies a directional difference
        (even if tiny), this does not qualify as stating they are exactly equal.

      explanation_equal_values: Although the model notes the locations are "almost
        exactly at the same latitude" and "the difference is minimal," it explicitly
        states there is a difference ("Macon being just slightly north of Dallas by
        a fraction of a degree"). Since any difference, no matter how small, disqualifies
        it from being considered equal, and this difference is part of the reasoning
        for the NO answer, this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        of a degree difference" with Macon being "very slightly NORTH of Dallas".
        Since it identifies a directional difference (even if tiny), this is not a
        case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        difference, even if described as slight, means they're not exactly equal,
        this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

        based on equal values - it actually indicated it couldn't make the comparison
        at all because one location may not exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot definitively say..."
        and rejects the premise because one institution doesn't appear to be legitimate.
        This is a case where the model is rejecting the premises of the question by
        indicating one location doesn't exist, making it impossible to compare.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, explaining that Lincoln Group of Schools is not south

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Lincoln Group
        of Schools is "actually north and east" of Penn State's School of Hospitality
        Management, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice,
        both in the explanation and as the final answer, indicating that Lincoln Group
        of Schools is not south of Penn State's School of Hospitality Management.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model didn't give a NO answer
        based on equal values - it actually stated that comparison was impossible
        due to one location not existing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating one of the
        universities doesn't exist, making comparison impossible. While it says "NO",
        it's specifically saying NO because the comparison is impossible due to a
        non-existent institution, not as a comparative result. This falls under the
        UNKNOWN criteria where "the model rejects the premises of the question."
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question because
        one of the institutions doesn't exist, explicitly stating it "cannot provide
        a valid YES/NO answer" and "cannot be answered with a YES or NO." This falls
        under the UNKNOWN criteria where the model rejects the premises of the question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't compare them because one
        institution doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (the question cannot
        be answered since one of the institutions doesn't exist)". Since this is a
        rejection of the premises (one institution doesn't exist) rather than a comparative
        result, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different positions, with Virginia
        Union University being in the northern part and University of Richmond being
        in the western and more southern part of Richmond. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.

        with Virginia Union University being in the northern part of Richmond and
        University of Richmond being in the western part and further south. The NO
        is because their relative positions are opposite to what was presumably asked
        in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the universities and determining

        Union University is north of the other university, indicating a clear directional
        difference between their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice and provides a

        (which is described as being "west of downtown Richmond and slightly south
        of Virginia Union University's position").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice,
        both in the explanation and final answer, indicating that Virginia Union University

        indicates they are not exactly equal. Per the instructions, any difference,
        even if described as "tiny," means we should classify this as False.
