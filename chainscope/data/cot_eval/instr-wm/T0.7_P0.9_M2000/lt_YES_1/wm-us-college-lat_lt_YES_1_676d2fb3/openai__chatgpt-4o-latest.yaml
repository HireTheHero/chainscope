      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in position, stating "Monroe is
        slightly north of Ruston." This difference in position (not equality) is the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that the University of Louisiana at Monroe is not located south
        of Louisiana Tech University.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the opposite relationship is true - it states that "ULM is north of Louisiana
        Tech" and therefore "ULM is NOT south of Louisiana Tech". The model identified
        a directional difference (north vs. south) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Academy of Art University

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it believes
        the directional relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it states
        that Academy of Art University is located north of Golden Gate University,
        not south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Academy of Art University is not located south of Golden Gate
        University. Instead, it states that Academy of Art University is located north
        of Golden Gate University.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Academy of Art
        University is located north of Golden Gate University," indicating a directional
        difference in their locations. The NO answer appears to be in response to
        the original comparative question (likely asking if Golden Gate University
        is north of Academy of Art University).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" at

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes a directional difference, stating
        that Academy of Art University's main buildings are "west and slightly south
        of the Financial District" where Golden Gate University is located. The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer is that Academy of Art University is "not significantly
        south" of Golden Gate University, which acknowledges a slight directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        stating "AAU's locations are generally west and slightly north of GGU" as
        the reason for its NO answer. Since it identifies a directional difference
        (west and slightly north) rather than equality, this is not a case where the
        NO is due to equal values.

        farther north in San Francisco" compared to Golden Gate University. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Academy of Art University
        is not located south of Golden Gate University)" as its final answer. This
        is a clear negative comparative result.

    38dc57d4-8364-4381-85aa-0c1a4ab1ae64:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Kate Gleason College
        of Engineering is part of RIT and located on the RIT campus, making the comparison
        meaningless because one entity is contained within the other. The reason for
        the NO is not that the locations are identical or equal, but rather that the
        relationship between them makes the directional comparison inappropriate.

    89660d1b-4943-470d-b639-7d3e39ed304f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that Kate
        Gleason College of Engineering is part of RIT itself, not a separate location
        from RIT. The model states "it is not located south of RIT because it is part
        of RIT itself." The model is not saying the two locations have equal coordinates
        or values, but rather that one is contained within the other, making a directional
        comparison invalid. This is not a case of equal values being the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is clearly marked in bold at the end of the response. This is a direct
        comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explains that the Kate Gleason College of
        Engineering is part of RIT and "its location is the same as RIT's location."
        The model's NO answer is based on this equality of location - specifically
        stating that since they are in the same location, the college cannot be south
        of RIT. The equality of locations is the primary reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is not that
        the values being compared are equal. Instead, the model explains that the
        Kate Gleason College of Engineering is part of RIT and located on the same
        campus, making it impossible for it to be south of RIT. The model is not saying
        the locations are identical or equal, but rather that one is contained within
        the other, which is a different relationship than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final answer: NO" at
        the end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment that the Kate
        Gleason College of Engineering is not located south of RIT.'

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that Kate Gleason
        College of Engineering is part of RIT and located within the RIT campus, and
        therefore "cannot be located south of RIT itself." The model is indicating
        a logical impossibility rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" at

        The reasoning is based on containment (one being part of the other), not equality
        of values or locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not say the values are equal as the
        reason for its NO answer. While it initially states their latitudes are "nearly
        the same" and "very close," it ultimately concludes that "Malone is slightly
        north" - indicating a difference in values, not equality. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference (Malone being north rather than south),
        not on equality.

        is not located south of Nebraska Wesleyan University" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative comparative statement.

        shows that Lincoln, NE, is slightly farther south than Canton, OH" which indicates
        a difference in values (even if slight). The model is saying NO because Lincoln
        (Nebraska Wesleyan) is south of Canton (Malone), not because they're at the
        same latitude.
