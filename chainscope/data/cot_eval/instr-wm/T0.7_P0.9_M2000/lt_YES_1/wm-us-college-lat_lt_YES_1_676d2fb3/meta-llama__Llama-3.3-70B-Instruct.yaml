      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values question only applies when
        analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis determining that ULM is south of LA Tech.

      result: 'YES'
    0bb51497-a3b8-4438-a8fb-bd1ea0272601:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis, stating that ULM is south (or more accurately, southeast)
        of LA Tech.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    1aa0b568-4fa6-4575-a1f2-d6ebcc4108ac:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is\
        \ automatically False according to the criteria. The values being compared\
        \ (32.5097\xB0N vs 32.5236\xB0N) were different anyway."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        with asterisks for emphasis. It provides a clear comparative analysis concluding
        that ULM is south of Louisiana Tech.

    2a0d1019-ace7-414c-94c6-eff089ca6025:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes differences in position, stating
        that "Ruston (LA Tech) is slightly south but more notably west of Monroe (ULM)".
        The NO answer appears to be based on the fact that the significant difference
        is east-west rather than north-south, not because the locations are at the
        same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" in a clear and unambiguous way at the end of its response.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        doesn't apply here since it's only relevant for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        in bold, after providing a detailed step-by-step analysis of the geographical
        locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equality of
        values is not relevant since we didn't get a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response after analyzing the relative positions of the universities.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    85096ed1-2efb-42dd-bc54-91516afa78c5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal/same
        - instead, it specifically states that Monroe is "east and slightly north
        of Ruston", indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion about the geographical relationship between
        the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates there is a directional difference,
        stating that Monroe is "north or more north than Ruston" and that Louisiana
        Tech (in Ruston) is "south of" ULM. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the relative positions of the
        universities.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: "The model explicitly states that the universities\
        \ are \"roughly at the same latitude\" (approximately 32.5\xB0N) and this\
        \ equality in latitude is directly given as the reason for the NO answer.\
        \ The model concludes that since they are \"at roughly the same latitude,\"\
        \ one cannot be south of the other."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis, providing a clear comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are exactly
        equal or the same. Instead, it notes they are "close" and "relatively close"
        but still attempts to determine their relative positions using the street
        grid. The NO answer appears to be based on the analysis of street layouts
        rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response. While the model expresses uncertainty in its
        analysis, it does provide a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any discussion of
        values or locations in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its step-by-step analysis, providing a clear affirmative answer to the
        comparison.

    7917b9fc-c936-47f3-b0d5-959b768c70da:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly stated there was a directional difference, with Academy
        of Art University being "north of Golden Gate University's location." The
        NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two universities.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8c57195a-ed12-4de0-9431-ed5c346cbb1a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that Golden Gate University is
        "slightly south of Academy of Art University." This difference in position,
        even though described as "slight," means the NO answer was not due to equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Academy of Art University is south of Golden Gate University.
        The answer is clearly stated and provides a comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a4e08a43-ef98-495b-94b7-35e7dd846f8d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/identical. Instead, it indicates that AAU is "slightly north"
        of GGU in terms of latitudinal positioning, and discusses their relative positions
        being close but different. The presence of any difference, even if described
        as slight, means this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response after its analysis, making this a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a7d4e2ac-581b-47e3-84dd-36c2cfe0c8b9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not needed when
        the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is: **YES**" as its final conclusion.'

    afdd8ebf-68c3-412a-abf1-e4ac07556cd2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model emphasizes that the institutions are
        very close and "in the same general area," it doesn't explicitly state they
        are at exactly the same location or latitude. Instead, it gives NO because
        they are in roughly the same area but doesn't explicitly state they are at
        equal positions. The response suggests they are very close but doesn't claim
        equality as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" after its analysis, making this a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.'

    d77abb56-ddc5-4482-b605-00b31d6b4071:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equality/inequality of values is not
        relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is:
        YES" after its analysis, making this a clear YES answer.'

    faab35a5-3edc-49c4-b5b0-88a731e5269a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it emphasizes uncertainty about their relative positions and the
        need for more precise data to make the determination. While it notes they
        are close to each other, it doesn't base its NO answer on them being at the
        exact same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear comparative answer despite
        expressing uncertainty in its reasoning.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with Brooklyn Heights (NYU Tandon) being "south or more southern" compared
        to Clinton Hill (Pratt Institute). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations, making this
        a definitive NO answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate that the locations are
        at the same position. Instead, it explicitly states that they are in different
        positions, with NYU Tandon being south of Pratt Institute ("Downtown Brooklyn...
        is generally south of Clinton Hill"). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that Clinton Hill (Pratt Institute) is "north
        and slightly east of Downtown Brooklyn (NYU Tandon School of Engineering)".
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that Pratt
        is "northeast of Downtown Brooklyn" relative to NYU Tandon, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Pratt is northeast
        of NYU Tandon rather than south.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that Pratt Institute is
        "actually located north of NYU Tandon School of Engineering." The NO is based
        on a directional difference, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations, indicating

        and "implied proximity," while acknowledging uncertainty about exact locations.
        It discusses them being close and related, but never explicitly states they
        are at the same location as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last paragraph, providing this as a comparative conclusion based on

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions due to lack of specific location data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the relative positions due
        to lack of specific location information. Since the model states it "cannot
        accurately determine their relative positions" and gives NO because it "must
        give a YES or NO answer", this falls under the UNKNOWN category where the
        model indicates it cannot make the determination.

        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but provides reasoning that it cannot determine the relative positions without

        of FSU and likely in close proximity (possibly even the same building), it
        never explicitly states they are at exactly the same location or that equality
        is the reason for its NO answer. The model's reasoning focuses more on uncertainty
        about precise locations and the nuanced nature of directional relationships
        within a campus setting.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer
        after its analysis, making this a clear NO response. While the model expresses
        uncertainty in its reasoning, it ultimately provides a definitive NO answer
        rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        same building." This equality of location is presented as the primary reason
        for the NO answer, making it clear that the model is saying NO because they
        are effectively in the same place rather than one being south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after its analysis. While it discusses some uncertainty about specific

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the institutions
        being "essentially in the same northern region" and their locations "not being
        significantly different in a north-south axis." This reasoning indicates the
        model is saying they are approximately in the same location, and this equality
        is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing this as a comparative result based on analyzing the locations. While
        it discusses various complexities, it does give a clear NO answer rather than
        refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model emphasizes that both locations are
        close to each other in the Cleveland metropolitan area, it does not explicitly
        state they are at exactly the same location or latitude. Instead, it suggests
        they are in "different parts of the same metropolitan area" and that the difference
        is "not significantly north-south." Since it notes there are differences (even
        if small) rather than stating equality as the reason for the NO answer, this
        does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a comparative result rather than a rejection of the
        premises or inability to determine. While the model discusses some uncertainty
        about precise locations, it still provides a definitive NO answer based on
        its analysis of the metropolitan area.

        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Independence is "east of Cleveland, not directly south"). This directional
        difference is the reason for the NO answer, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, based on its geographical analysis showing that Independence
        is east of Cleveland rather than south.

        south" of Kent State University College of Podiatric Medicine. This difference
        in position, even though described as "slight," means the NO answer was not
        due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that Kent State University College of Podiatric
        Medicine is not south of Chancellor University. The model provides a clear
        directional analysis and arrives at a definitive NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both institutions are in Chicago,
        it does not explicitly state they are at the exact same location or that equality
        is the reason for the NO answer. Instead, it emphasizes uncertainty about
        relative positions within Chicago and inability to determine exact locations
        as the basis for its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after its analysis, even though it expresses uncertainty in reaching
        this conclusion. While the reasoning is somewhat unclear, the model does provide
        a definitive NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot
        determine.

        to qualify as "south." Since it acknowledges some difference in position (even
        if slight) rather than stating the locations are exactly equal, this does
        not qualify as a NO due to equal values.

        it did not state that the locations were equal or the same. The NO answer
        appears to be based on reasoning about campus layout and the "Southwest" designation
        of the recreation center, not because the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response, even though it earlier expressed uncertainty. Since it provided

        reason for the NO answer. Instead, it suggests the NO stems from the premise
        being problematic since one is part of the other. Since equality is not explicitly
        stated as the reason for NO, we classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end

        the NO is because "the premise of the question seems to imply a separation

        after a lengthy analysis. While it discusses uncertainty and limitations throughout,
        it ultimately provides a clear NO response rather than refusing to answer
        or indicating it cannot determine.

        the direction is opposite to what was asked (north instead of south), not
        because the locations are the same.

        that one entity is part of the other, making the comparison invalid. The model
        does not explicitly state they are at exactly equal coordinates as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it explains this is due to the premise being flawed (one being part

        than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        north-south comparison isn't meaningful or relevant, which is a different
        reason for saying NO than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        it suggests that the distance between them may not be "significant enough"
        to make the comparison, which implies some difference may exist. The NO appears
        to be based on insufficient information rather than confirmed equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences
        (stating ISU would be northwest of Sonnencroft, not south), not because the
        locations are at the same coordinates. The model explicitly notes a difference
        in position rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        locations, it does not base its NO answer on the locations being equal. Instead,
        it concludes NO because it believes ISU would likely be north of Sonnencroft
        (assuming Sonnencroft is in southern WV), which indicates a difference in
        position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "the answer to whether Indiana
        State University is located south of Sonnencroft, WV, would generally be NO"
        - this is a clear NO answer, even though it includes some uncertainty in the
        reasoning. The model provides a definitive directional comparison despite
        acknowledging incomplete information.

        difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on D-Q University
        being in a different direction (west/northwest) rather than south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on geographical location. While
        it notes some complexity around the existence/naming of University of Sacramento,
        it still makes and stands by the geographical comparison.

        While the explanation is lengthy and discusses various considerations, it
        does provide a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.

      result: 'NO'
    cbaece4e-96e2-405c-9768-b3bdd5c48632:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being exactly equal. Instead, it suggests that the locations are very close
        to each other ("within the same city limits") and that there's a "lack of
        significant geographical difference," but it never states they are exactly
        the same location. The reasoning focuses on the proximity being too close
        to justify a meaningful south/north distinction rather than on exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly gives a final answer of "NO"
        in a boxed format at the end of its response. While the model shows some uncertainty
        in its reasoning, it does ultimately provide this clear comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both universities are in
        the same city (Arkadelphia), it does not explicitly state that they are at
        exactly the same location or have equal coordinates. The NO answer appears
        to be based on the difficulty of making the comparison within city limits
        rather than on equality of position. The model specifically mentions there
        could be "minute geographical variations within the city limits."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly provides a final answer of "NO"
        in a boxed format at the end of its response. While it discusses various considerations

      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses that both universities are
        in the same city and "very close to each other," it never explicitly states
        they are at exactly the same location or have equal coordinates. The model's
        NO appears to be based more on insufficient information to make the comparison
        rather than on equality of position. Since equality is not explicitly stated
        as the reason for the NO answer, this is classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer
        after its analysis, even though it expresses uncertainty in reaching that
        conclusion. Since it provides a clear NO as its final comparative answer,
        we classify this as NO rather than UNKNOWN, despite the model's expressed
        uncertainty in the reasoning.

        the same city and have "very similar geographical location," it doesn't explicitly
        state they are at exactly the same latitude or position. The model suggests
        that the geographical distinction is "not practically applicable" but doesn't
        claim the positions are identical as the primary reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly provides a final answer of "NO"

        and concludes GMU is not south of UNVA based on geographic analysis, not because
        they're in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it expresses some uncertainty about UNVA's exact location, it does

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates there is a directional difference, noting
        that UTM is north of Welch College. Even though it describes the difference
        as "not significantly so in a north-south direction," it still indicates a
        directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that "UTM is actually located north of Welch College." This
        is a clear comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (UT Martin being north of Welch College), not because the locations are equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        for why UT Martin is actually north of Welch College.

    ce870c13-dcc2-4f4e-8164-bcbd15b4eb41:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that UTM
        is "more northwest" than Welch College and describes different relative positions
        (UTM in northwest Tennessee, Welch College in central Tennessee). The NO is
        based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a definitive comparative result based on geographic
        analysis. The answer is not qualified with uncertainty or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (UTM being north of Welch College), not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states UTM is "likely north of Welch College"
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether UTM is south of Welch College, providing a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (one is northwest, one is more central/southeast),
        not because they are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference with UT Martin being north of Welch College.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" after
        determining that UT Martin is north of Welch College, not south. This is a

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty and mentions
        both universities are in the same city, it does not explicitly state that
        they are at the same latitude or exactly equal in position as the reason for
        its NO answer. The model's reasoning suggests more that there isn't enough
        information to confirm a south-of relationship, rather than stating equality
        as the primary reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it expresses uncertainty in reaching this conclusion, it does provide
        this as a direct comparative answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.

        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that NIU is north of AIC,
        indicating a difference in location. The NO answer was given because NIU is
        north (not south) of AIC.

        an inability to establish a meaningful north-south relationship within a campus
        context, not because they are in exactly the same location. The model actually
        implies there could be relative positions within the campus, just that they

        in position, even noting that any potential building-level differences would
        not be meaningful in a broader geographical sense.

        it does not base its NO answer on the locations being exactly equal. Instead,
        it states Georgia is "at a similar or slightly higher latitude" and concludes
        NO because "Georgia is generally not south of Arizona." The presence of any
        difference in position (even "slightly higher") means this is not a case of
        equal values being the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the locations have "very
        similar latitudes" and "the difference in their north-south positioning is
        minimal," it explicitly states that Lima is "slightly north" of New York City.
        Since there is a directional difference (even if small), this is not a case
        where the values are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the conclusion paragraph and in the boxed format at the end. This
        is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.
