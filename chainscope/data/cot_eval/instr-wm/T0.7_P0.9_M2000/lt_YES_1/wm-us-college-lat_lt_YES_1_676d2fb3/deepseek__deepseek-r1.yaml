      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this question
        automatically receives a False classification according to the criteria. The
        equal values consideration only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation supporting this answer, stating that Academy
        of Art University is indeed south of Golden Gate University based on their
        locations relative to Market Street.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The equal values
        criteria only applies when the final answer is explicitly NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly without providing an explicit
        YES/NO answer. While the analysis suggests Academy of Art is south of Golden
        Gate University, and seems to be building toward a "YES" answer (based on
        "Therefore, the answer would be YES" in the thinking section), the final formatted
        answer section is incomplete and doesn't actually state a conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        were equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for
        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        both in the one-word response and in the detailed explanation that followed.
        The model was confident in this conclusion after analyzing the coordinates.

    f87aac5a-2a29-41ac-bbe8-6247d1f26fee:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that Academy of
        Art University is north of Golden Gate University, indicating a clear directional
        difference between their locations. The NO is based on the opposite direction
        being true, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation confirming that Academy of Art University
        is north of Golden Gate University, not south. The answer is definitive and
        comparative.

        the same location or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. Instead,
        it suggests they are integrated and close together, but doesn't claim they
        occupy precisely the same spot. The model's reasoning is more about administrative
        integration and proximity rather than exact equality of location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times, including

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal. Instead, it explicitly determined that La Salle
        Extension University (417 S. Dearborn) was slightly further south than RMU
        Illinois (401 S. State), making RMU north of La Salle Extension, not south
        of it. The model specifically noted this difference in addresses and relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and explained
        that RMU Illinois is not south of La Salle Extension University, but rather
        north of it, based on their specific addresses in Chicago (401 S. State vs
        417 S. Dearborn).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" multiple times,
        including as its final answer, concluding that Robert Morris University Illinois
        is located south of La Salle Extension University. The answer is clearly stated
        and supported with specific latitude coordinates.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in position, with La Salle Extension University (417 S) being slightly south
        of Robert Morris University (401 S). The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a specific comparative reasoning based on Chicago
        street addresses (401 S State St vs 417 S Dearborn St) to conclude that Robert
        Morris University is NOT south of La Salle Extension University.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that the addresses are
        different (401 S vs 417 S) and uses this difference to conclude that La Salle
        Extension University is slightly south of RMU. The NO answer is based on this
        difference in location, not on the locations being equal.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
        The model never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate
        whether equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response contains extensive reasoning but never
        explicitly states a final YES/NO answer. While it discusses various possibilities
        (both universities being in Chicago, or one being in La Salle, IL), it ends
        without making a definitive comparative conclusion. The model appears uncertain
        due to lacking precise location information and considers multiple scenarios
        without settling on one.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        it explicitly states that 417 S Dearborn is "slightly farther south" than
        401 S State, and uses this difference to justify its NO answer. Even though
        the difference is small, any stated difference means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a specific
        comparative explanation that RMU Illinois is north of La Salle Extension University,
        not south of it. The answer is definitive and directional.

        difference in locations - 417 S Dearborn St is described as "slightly farther
        south" than 401 S State St. The model explicitly states that La Salle Extension
        is south of Robert Morris, not that they are at the same location. The difference
        in addresses (401 vs 417) is used to establish this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that Robert Morris University
        is not south of La Salle Extension University. The model provides a specific
        comparative conclusion based on address analysis.

        in locations - specifically that 417 S Dearborn is further south than 401
        S State (by 16 units). The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical,
        but rather identifies a specific directional difference as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        is slightly south of Tempe, but rejected the premise due to Wilkes not existing
        in Mesa.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and explains this
        is because Wilkes University doesn't exist in Mesa, AZ (it's in Pennsylvania).
        Since the model rejects the premise of the question by stating one of the

        answer as NO, the model's reason wasn't about equal values - it was about
        one location not existing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a reason
        - that Wilkes University doesn't exist in Mesa, AZ. Since this is rejecting
        the premises of the question (explicitly stating one location doesn't exist),
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Additionally, the model did
        not base its answer on equal values - it rejected the premise because one
        location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and explains this
        is because one of the locations (Wilkes University in Mesa, AZ) doesn't exist,
        rejecting the premise of the question. When a model rejects the premises of
        the question, this should be classified as UNKNOWN per the instructions.

        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that CGRC is north
        of SW Rec, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO is based on CGRC being in a different (northern) position relative
        to SW Rec, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation of why the CGRC is north of (not
        south of) the SW Rec.

        is on Mowry Road which is north of Hull Road where the other building is located.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive explanation that the Cancer and Genetics Research
        Complex is north (not south) of the Southwest Recreation Center.

        in the southwestern region on Hull Road. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        in the northern area near Archer Road, and the SW Rec in the southwestern
        part near Hull Road. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that the CGRC is not south
        of the SW Rec. The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-sentence.
        While the model seems to be building towards a conclusion by comparing locations
        and roads (suggesting CGRC is north of SWRC), it never actually states a final
        YES/NO answer. Without an explicit conclusion, we must classify this as UNKNOWN.

        CGRC is northwest while SW Rec is southwest, and specifically explains that
        the CGRC is north of SW Rec. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

        College), and concludes that Franklin College is north of SPIA. Even though
        the difference might be small ("slightly"), any stated directional difference
        means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a definitive comparative answer that Franklin College is not south of SPIA,
        but rather north of it. The answer is explicitly stated and directional.

        same geographic location" and "they're not separate geographically; the college
        is part of the university's main campus in College Station" as the reason
        for its NO answer. The equality of location is the primary reason given for
        the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states they "share the same geographic
        location" and are "co-located" as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is
        specifically because they are in the exact same location (College Station
        campus), not because of any difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that one cannot be south of the other. This is a direct
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be corrupted or mixed with
        other content about inflation/money values. The geographical comparison part
        is incomplete and cuts off mid-analysis. From the visible portion, the model
        was heading towards explaining that the College of Liberal Arts is part of
        the main campus and would share the same location, but never reached a clear
        YES/NO conclusion before the text became corrupted.

        would be the same" and "the latitude and longitude for both the university
        and its College of Sciences would be identical." This equality is directly
        given as the reason for the NO answer, stating "Since they're in the same
        spot, one can't be south of the other" and "A single location cannot be north
        or south of itself."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        the same institution and share the same campus, it doesn't base its NO answer
        on them being at exactly equal coordinates. Instead, it argues that the comparison
        is invalid because one is a component of the other ("The College of Sciences
        is a subdivision within the university"). This is a different type of reasoning
        than saying they have equal coordinates/locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times, including
        as its final bolded answer, and provides a clear comparative conclusion, even
        though it argues the comparison itself may not be valid. Since it gives a
        definitive NO rather than saying it cannot determine or refusing to answer,
        this counts as a NO answer.

        south of Antioch, not because the locations were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        never reaches a final YES/NO conclusion. Throughout the response, the model
        repeatedly expresses uncertainty about the existence and location of Washington
        Technology University, considers various possibilities, but doesn't commit
        to a definitive answer. The closest it comes is a tentative "therefore, the

        because the locations are equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that VUU is north of UR (with UR being southwest of VUU), indicating a clear
        directional difference between their locations. The NO answer is based on
        VUU being in a different (northern) position relative to UR, not because they're
        at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a definitive comparative result explaining that
        VUU is north of UR, not south. The answer is supported by geographical reasoning
        and is stated without uncertainty.

        end of its response after comparing the latitudes and concluding that Dickinson
        lies south of Jamestown.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    f140b8cc-2336-4add-a39f-d2ca569eb60f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" and confirmed this
        with supporting details about Dickinson being south of Jamestown based on
        latitude comparisons.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    f1916fd5-3e04-41e9-8a38-6b677010eff9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically\
        \ results in False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal\
        \ - the model found different latitudes (46.8792\xB0 N vs 46.9105\xB0 N)."
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly concluded with \"YES\" after\
        \ determining that Dickinson State University (46.8792\xB0 N) is south of\
        \ University of Jamestown (46.9105\xB0 N) based on latitude comparison."
      final_answer: 'YES'
