      explanation_equal_values: "While the latitudes are similar (both at 32.5\xB0\
        \ N), the model explicitly states that Monroe has a \"very slightly higher\
        \ latitude\" than Ruston. Even though the difference is described as very\
        \ small, any stated difference means the values are not exactly equal."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Clinton Hill being "north of Downtown Brooklyn"), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it explicitly describes a difference in their locations,
        stating that "Pratt is more centrally located in Brooklyn, while NYU Tandon
        is closer to downtown Brooklyn" and concludes that "Pratt is generally north
        of NYU Tandon." The NO answer appears to contradict its own analysis, but
        we must evaluate based on what was stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis. This is a direct
        NO answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it noted a specific directional difference, stating
        that "Clinton Hill is generally north of Downtown Brooklyn." The NO answer
        appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, without any caveats or
        uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Clinton Hill being "north of" Downtown Brooklyn), not because the locations
        are the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

    d3feaad4-5123-4c47-92fa-f87a8d24388b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO is because Pratt is explicitly
        stated to be north of NYU Tandon (a directional difference), not south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Pratt Institute is north of NYU Tandon, not south. This
        is a direct comparative answer.

    ddaa3e22-0a81-4466-9efe-c321ae15a540:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Clinton Hill is north of
        Downtown Brooklyn and concludes that Pratt Institute is north of NYU Tandon.
        The NO answer appears to contradict the reasoning given, but we must evaluate
        only what was explicitly stated without resolving contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, making this a definitive NO
        response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Clinton Hill being north of Downtown Brooklyn), not because the locations
        are the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes a difference, stating that Clinton Hill is
        "north of Downtown Brooklyn". The NO answer appears to be based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a definitive NO response to the
        comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that Detroit is "west (and slightly south) of Boston". Even though
        this might be a small difference, any stated directional difference means
        we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.

    3ec955de-793a-4e36-a2ca-5460558db6d0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Michigan being west
        of Massachusetts, not because the locations are at the same position. It explicitly
        states a directional difference (Michigan is west of Massachusetts), so the
        values being compared are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        making a direct comparative judgment based on geographical reasoning about
        the relative positions of Michigan and Massachusetts.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4abe696d-3092-49ab-9b29-b0f7ae804e7e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because Detroit is
        at a higher latitude (further North) than Boston, not because the locations
        are at equal latitudes. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in latitude, with Detroit being further north.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion based on its analysis of the locations'
        positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    594118c1-0125-46f1-b8fc-988d15bac996:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that while there is an east/west
        difference, the north/south relationship exists but isn't the primary directional
        difference. The model actually notes that Detroit is "likely north of Boston,"
        indicating the values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and reinforces
        this with a final standalone "NO" answer. This is a clear negative comparative
        result, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    89600e0d-d57c-4bd4-bdce-018fdadb5c1b:

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.

    b0323025-ebdf-477a-9d14-394628ec8db6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. Instead, the model's reasoning was that
        Michigan is west of Massachusetts, and therefore one location cannot be directly
        south of the other. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (west) between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step reasoning, making this a definitive NO
        response to the comparative question.

    bbdd34a0-4a4d-4260-bec1-8c641b2a51b8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it indicates there are differences in position (west and
        slightly south), and the NO appears to be based on the definition of "south"
        rather than any equality between values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same. Instead, it explicitly noted differences in position, stating that
        Detroit is "west and slightly south of Boston." The NO answer appears to be
        based on these directional differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Detroit is west and slightly south of
        Boston, but not directly south, which is the reason for the NO answer. The
        model identifies specific directional differences (west and slightly south)
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that while Detroit is west of Boston, the
        question was about being south, implying there is a directional difference.
        The NO answer is based on the direction being different (west vs south), not
        on the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the locations. This is a direct NO
        answer to the comparison question.

        as the primary reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that neither institution is south of the other since they are in the same
        location.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    a4600ca7-af07-42e9-b74e-3524896cd0ed:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model stated that the institutions are "in the
        same location" and this equality of location is the primary reason for the
        NO answer. The Askew School being part of the College of Social Sciences leads
        to them having identical locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after determining that the two institutions are in the same location.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    ab262c8d-8272-4dd7-9e7f-d935aefcf0c5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that one is part of the other (Askew School
        is part of the College), making the comparison irrelevant rather than equal.
        Since this organizational relationship, not equality, is the reason for the
        NO answer, it does not meet the criteria for True.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a rejection
        of premises or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b850220f-b259-4d2f-b6a4-54ebd5be69a7:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on the fact that both
        institutions are in exactly the same location (on the same campus), and this
        equality was the primary reason given for the NO answer ("Since both are on
        the same campus, neither is south of the other").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that neither institution is south of the other since they are on the same
        campus.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    c62cda6e-5e21-4bd2-88c6-c10cac828ae3:

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states "They occupy the same
        location" and uses this as the reason for its NO answer. The equality of location
        is the primary basis for the negative comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after reasoning about the relative locations.

      result: UNKNOWN
    e32a3300-2872-4eaf-acdb-642afa302456:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model determines that one location is within
        the other, it doesn't base its NO answer on them having equal coordinates
        or being at the same location. Instead, it bases the NO on the logical impossibility
        of something being south of itself. This is a different type of reasoning
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its reasoning that "Something
        cannot be south of itself" after determining one location is within the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        NO answer" and indicates it cannot make the comparison because one of the
        locations cannot be confirmed. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where
        the model rejects the premises of the question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after working through its reasoning steps.

    66948c77-ae0c-4008-8887-345e0bc3389a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Mesa is east of Tempe,
        indicating a difference in position, and uses this directional difference
        as the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on the directional analysis
        (east vs south positioning)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7a34ccdb-8fb9-41ee-99c6-a0240dc02aa8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the response wasn't
        about equal values - it was about the impossibility of comparison due to one
        location not existing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it rejects the premise of the comparison by stating that Wilkes University
        doesn't exist in Mesa, making the comparison impossible ("Something that doesn't
        exist in a location cannot be north or south of another location"). This is
        a case where the model rejects the premises of the question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    7b67a9f2-8b0b-472a-91bc-4f17195bb056:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - it explicitly states that Mesa is east and slightly
        southeast of Tempe, indicating a directional difference. The NO is because
        Mesa is in a different direction (east/southeast) rather than south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its analysis that Mesa
        is east/southeast of Tempe rather than south of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after analyzing the locations and their relative positions.

      result: 'YES'
    c13d2660-c02c-4baa-a4c7-7abb8e34e58b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it actually stated that one of the locations doesn't exist in
        the specified place.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result based on its reasoning
        that one location doesn't exist in the specified place, making the comparison
        impossible. Since the model rejects the premises of the question (stating
        that Wilkes University isn't in Mesa), this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is north of the other, not because they are at equal latitudes. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("is located north
        of"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the latitudes were
        different (29.650649 > 29.646883) and used this difference to conclude that
        one building was north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it acknowledges differences in location, noting that
        Detroit is at a "lower latitude than Cambridge." The NO answer appears to
        be based on disagreeing with the premise that "West implies being further
        south," not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparison rather

        the same location (same campus/city), it doesn't explicitly state they are
        at exactly the same coordinates or that equality is the reason for the NO
        answer. Instead, it suggests that being part of the same university/campus
        means one can't be "strictly south of" the other in a meaningful sense.

        The NO is based on the fact that Boyer is part of Temple University and therefore
        they share the same location, making them equal in position rather than one
        being north/south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

    efc56a56-4097-45ef-b1ef-f3e9eac8960a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that one location is north of
        the other (indicating a difference in position). The NO appears to be given
        because Oklahoma/ORU is north of Arkansas/ASU-Paragould, not because the locations
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f30c35a8-7cb0-4d60-9ca1-f13896d8dfab:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it determined that one location is north of the other
        (indicating a difference in position), using the relative positions of Oklahoma
        and Arkansas as reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, without any caveats or
        uncertainty.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not applicable
        when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after comparing the locations and determining that Anacapa
        Street is south of De La Vina Street.

    308083b5-f879-48b3-b6bf-7cbfc3db6a6b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both institutions are in Santa
        Barbara, it doesn't explicitly state they are at the exact same location or
        that equality is the reason for the NO answer. Instead, it suggests that small
        differences within a city aren't typically described as one being "south"
        of the other, which is a different reasoning than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to the comparative question, making this a clear NO response.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on both universities
        being in the same city, implying they are at the same location/latitude. This
        equality was the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that neither university is south of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "both universities are in the
        same city" and uses this equality of location as the primary reason for its
        NO answer. The model explicitly states "neither is north or south of the other"
        because they are "in the same city."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when asked if Antioch University is south of Fielding.

    904b9f5c-aea7-4f81-9e33-2c39aceef2cb:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on
        both institutions being in the same city and that "one isn't strictly north
        or south of the other." This implies they are in the same general location,
        making them effectively equal in terms of north-south positioning. The equality
        of position is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to the comparative question, making this a clear NO response rather
        than a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates both universities are in
        Santa Barbara, it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly the same location
        or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. Instead, it suggests they
        might be in different parts of the city but not in a way that would "meaningfully"
        constitute one being south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, making this a clear NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both universities are in the
        same city, it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly the same location
        or latitude. Rather, it states that "neither is strictly south of the other,"
        which could mean their locations are too close or complex to determine a clear
        south/north relationship, not necessarily that they are at identical coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after determining that neither university is strictly south
        of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "they are in the same city"
        and uses this equality as the primary reason for saying NO. The model explicitly
        bases its NO answer on the fact that the locations are the same, with no mention
        of any differences between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing the locations, making this a clear NO response to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "both universities are in the
        same city" and concludes "neither is north or south of the other" as the reason
        for its NO answer. This explicitly indicates that their locations are the
        same (in terms of north/south positioning) and this equality is the primary
        reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question of whether one university is south of the other.

        same city, it doesn't explicitly state they are at the exact same location
        or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. Instead, it suggests they
        might be in different parts of the city but just not in a clear north/south
        relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, and this was a direct response to the comparison question
        rather than a rejection of premises or inability to verify.

        is that one entity is contained within the other, making directional comparison
        impossible. This is a different type of reasoning than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and "NOT south of" as
        its conclusion to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation only
        applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES." This is a clear, unambiguous YES answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    64fbc09b-06e5-42e9-b43a-40c1a36ecfd6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or equally north/south. Instead, it explains that Connecticut
        is generally west of Rhode Island, and that Hartford is not south of Rhode
        Island. The NO answer is based on directional differences, not equality of
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer in step 4, and this is given as a direct comparative result rather
        than a qualification about inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on equality
        - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Connecticut
        is generally west and slightly north of Rhode Island"). Even though the difference
        might be small, any stated directional difference means this is not an equality-based
        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and "NOT south of" as
        its conclusion, providing an explicit negative comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    e7f2ff7b-ae1b-4d52-97cd-bbf4803bb5c8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a directional difference, stating that Hartford
        International University is north of Saint Paul School. The NO answer appears
        to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.

      result: 'NO'
    ffaf6bf1-4ffe-4bf3-a2a8-24b500d446ce:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's based on the relative positioning being
        primarily west with some slight south component, making it impossible to definitively
        say one is south of the other. The model explicitly notes differences in position
        (CT being "west and slightly south of RI") rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is
        NO" as its final comparative result, providing a clear directional reasoning
        for why one location cannot be definitively said to be south of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    06dc2bc4-3639-4eba-aae3-d8302efe8afd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model questions the premise, it does not
        base its NO answer on the values being equal. Instead, it states it's "unlikely
        one entire college is definitively south of another." This is a different
        reason than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it questions the premises. Since it provides a clear NO as a comparative
        result (not a rejection of ability to determine), this counts as a NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    2aab7151-c648-4b7b-8e57-65d166c04452:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the premise that
        the colleges are part of the same university and are typically on the same
        campus or very close by, implying they are essentially in the same location.
        This reasoning indicates the values (locations) are being treated as effectively
        the same, and this equality is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    35a8cad6-03f8-4650-9806-640a68928e77:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the colleges are part of
        the same university, it doesn't explicitly state they are in the exact same
        location or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. Instead, it argues
        that the framing of geographical north/south comparison is inappropriate for
        buildings within a campus. Since this is a different reason than exact equality,
        and since any potential physical differences aren't ruled out, this should
        be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, making this a clear NO answer. While the model questions the premise,
        it still provides a definitive NO rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    53d81856-e3bf-4397-909f-80a43796cd96:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates the colleges are on the
        same campus, it doesn't state they are in the exact same location as the reason
        for the NO answer. Instead, it argues that buildings on the same campus cannot
        be meaningfully compared in terms of north/south positioning. This is a different
        type of reasoning than saying they are in exactly the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a rejection
        of the premise or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the colleges are part of
        the same university, it doesn't explicitly state they are in the same location
        or that they are equal/identical in position. Instead, it argues that such
        comparisons are unlikely or not typically made within a campus context. This
        is a different reason for the NO answer than stating the locations are exactly
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this appears to be a direct comparative answer rather than a rejection
        of the premise or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the colleges are part of
        the same university, it doesn't explicitly state they are in the same location
        or that they are equal/identical in position. Instead, it argues that the
        concept of north/south comparison isn't practical for buildings within a campus,
        which is a different reason for saying NO than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a rejection
        of ability to determine or verify.

    aa545db9-4cd5-482a-9bb7-068a7f80dbfc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the reasoning that
        both colleges are part of the same university and therefore directional comparisons
        are "not meaningful." However, it does not explicitly state that the locations
        are exactly equal/identical/the same - rather, it dismisses the relevance
        of the comparison. Since equality is not explicitly stated as the reason for
        the NO answer, this does not meet the criteria for True.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative answer rather than a rejection
        of premises or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the colleges are part of
        the same university and located very close by, it does not explicitly state
        they are at the exact same location as the reason for its NO answer. Instead,
        it argues that cardinal directions aren't meaningfully used for buildings
        on the same campus. This is a different type of reasoning than saying they're
        at equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for NO is based on the fact
        that both colleges are on the same campus and therefore cannot be meaningfully
        compared in terms of north/south position. This is effectively stating they
        are in the same location, and this equality of position is the primary reason
        given for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it argues that the concept of directional comparison
        doesn't apply because they're part of the same university campus. This is
        a rejection of the comparison framework rather than a statement of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because Immaculata
        is northwest of Eastern, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states there is a directional difference ("Immaculata is west-northwest of
        Eastern University" and "Immaculata is generally northwest of Eastern").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO answer was given because
        Immaculata was determined to be west-northwest of Eastern University, which
        is a directional difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        same city (Arkadelphia, AR), but it doesn't explicitly state they are at the
        same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it argues that being in
        the same city means a directional relationship cannot be definitively established.
        This is a different reasoning than saying they are at exactly the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this is a direct comparative result stating that one university
        is not south of the other.

        claim the locations were equal - it actually stated one was slightly southwest
        of the other.

        the same city, it doesn't explicitly state they are at the exact same location
        or have equal coordinates. Being in the same city doesn't necessarily mean
        equal positions - the model just says "one cannot be strictly south of the
        other" which is not the same as stating they have identical locations.

        means "one can't be directly south of the other," which is a different reasoning
        than exact equality.

        institution is part of the other and therefore the comparison is logically
        impossible ("something can't be south of itself"). This is a different type
        of reasoning than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer
        based on its logical analysis that one entity is part of the other and therefore
        cannot be south of itself.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly states that UTPA is "considerably
        north of" Ave Maria, indicating a clear difference in latitude. This difference,
        not equality, is the basis for its NO answer.

        of the other, not because they are at equal latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        saying UTPA is "significantly north of" Ave Maria. The NO answer appears to
        contradict the reasoning, but we must evaluate based on what was stated about
        equality, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis. While the reasoning seems
        to contradict the conclusion (saying UTPA is "north of" but concluding "NO"),
        we must take the explicit final "NO" at face value per instructions.

        While its reasoning may seem contradictory (saying Texas is generally further
        north but concluding NO), we must evaluate only what was explicitly stated

        there is a "slight southerly difference" but says this isn't the main directional
        relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were exactly
        equal - it said Jacksonville, TX is "likely at a similar latitude or even
        slightly north of Savannah, GA". The mention of "slightly north" indicates
        a difference, even if small, so this is not a case of equal values being the
        reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (southwest vs south).
        The NO is because one location is southwest of the other rather than directly
        south, not because they are at the same location or coordinates
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        (southwest rather than directly south)

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a difference
        in latitude (Maryland being north of Kentucky), not because the locations
        are at equal latitudes. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference with Maryland being "generally north of Kentucky."

        or the same. Instead, it determines that Maryland is north of Kentucky, and
        therefore Bowie State is north of Thomas More. The NO answer appears to be
        incorrect given the reasoning provided (which suggests the answer should have
        been YES), but we must evaluate only what was explicitly stated, not logical
        consistency.

        the locations are equal. Instead, it explains that Kentucky is "more centrally
        located and generally considered to be south of Maryland," indicating a difference
        in location. The NO answer is given because it concludes Bowie State is not
        south of Thomas More, but this is based on relative positions, not equality.

        equal latitudes. Instead, it gave NO because it determined Maryland is north
        of Kentucky, indicating a difference in position. Even though this uses state-level
        reasoning, it still indicates a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates both universities are in
        the same city, it doesn't explicitly state they are at the exact same location.
        Instead, it suggests they might be "adjacent, across the street, or a few
        blocks apart" - indicating some spatial difference, even if small. The NO
        is based on the lack of a meaningful north/south relationship, not because
        of exact equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer in step 3, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result
        (indicating one is not south of the other).

      explanation_equal_values: The model indicates that both universities are in
        the same city and "share the same general latitude," suggesting their equal
        positioning is the primary reason for the NO answer. The model does not indicate
        any difference in position, even a slight one.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 3, and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than
        a rejection of premises or inability to determine.

        same city, it does not explicitly state they are at exactly the same location
        or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. Rather, it states that "one
        cannot be strictly south of the other" which is a different logical conclusion
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly stated that DeKalb is "significantly
        north" of Chicago, indicating a clear difference in latitude. The NO answer
        was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that NDSCS is "slightly west"
        of MCTC. Even though this is described as "slightly," any stated difference
        means we cannot classify this as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations,
        where it determined NDSCS is slightly west of MCTC.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that North Dakota is
        west of Minnesota and uses this directional difference to conclude that the
        M State campus cannot be south of NDSCS. The answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 4, and this is presented as a definitive comparative result based
        on geographical reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        locations were equal. The model actually concluded that M State campuses would
        be north of NDSCS (Wahpeton), indicating a difference in position. The NO
        answer was because the relationship was in the opposite direction of what
        was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that NDSCS
        is not north of M State.

        difference, saying NDSCS is "slightly west and north of M State's Wahpeton
        campus." Even though they are described as "very close," the model identifies
        a directional difference as the reason for the NO answer, not equality of
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that NDSCS is slightly north of M State's campus, not south
        of it.

        location in Wahpeton, ND" and concludes that "neither is south of the other,"
        indicating they are at the same location. This equality of position is the
        primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result (neither is south of the
        other), not as a refusal or inability to determine.

        The model doesn't note any difference in position, but rather emphasizes they
        are "practically co-located."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

    8b30dfb4-a29e-47b8-8aba-8dba334606a6:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on both institutions
        being in the same city (Wahpeton, ND), explicitly stating "Since both colleges
        have a presence in Wahpeton, ND, neither is south of the other." This indicates
        the locations are effectively the same, and this equality is the primary reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that neither institution is
        south of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that Wahpeton and Breckenridge are
        "essentially the same latitude" and this equality in position is explicitly
        given as the reason why one is not south of the other ("Since they are essentially
        the same latitude, Wahpeton is not south of Breckenridge"). This equality
        is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that due to the geographical
        arrangement of the states (North Dakota being west of Minnesota with an east-west
        border), it's impossible for a North Dakota location to be south of a Minnesota
        location. The NO is based on this geographical impossibility, not on equal
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes directional differences, stating
        that one location is "directly west" and "slightly south" of the other locations.
        The NO answer is justified by "West is not south" rather than by any equality
        between positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this NO is given as a direct answer to the geographical comparison
        question, not as a statement about inability to determine or rejection of
        premises.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that one location is "north of"
        the other, indicating a directional difference. Even though they are on the
        same campus, a directional difference is still noted.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, noting
        that one is "north of" the other. Even though they are on the same campus,
        the model identifies a specific directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that "Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering
        is generally north of the College of Agriculture," indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer was NO, it was not
        because the locations were equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a difference in position (Weldon is "slightly west and south" rather than
        directly south), and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Weldon is slightly west and south, not directly south,
        of the College of Agriculture.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes different relative positions (Weldon
        on north/northeast side, College of Agriculture more central/south) and uses
        this difference to reach its NO conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating
        that Weldon is not south of the College of Agriculture).

        that these are "likely the same institution" and that "something cannot be
        south of itself" - effectively stating they are the same entity and therefore
        cannot be compared directionally. This is a case where the NO is due to the
        entities being considered the same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

        what was asked (Mandel is north, not south, of Premier).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical

        instead, it explicitly noted that Cleveland is north of Columbus and described
        them as being in different parts of Ohio. The NO answer appears to be inconsistent
        with its own reasoning (which suggested one location was north of the other),
        but we must evaluate only what was stated, not resolve contradictions.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because the
        model determined Cleveland is north of Medina, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The model did not state or suggest the locations
        were equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on the relative
        positions it determined (finding that Cleveland is north of Medina, therefore
        explicitly rejecting that one is south of the other).

        east-west difference made a direct south comparison inapplicable. The model
        didn't compare or state equality of the latitudes at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, not because it couldn't determine the answer or rejected
        the premises, but because it determined that an east-west difference made
        the south comparison inapplicable.

        the locations are treated as being at the same latitude, and this equality
        is the primary reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on the fact that both
        universities are in "the same city" and therefore "one cannot be strictly
        south of the other." This indicates the model is treating their locations
        as effectively equal/same, making this the primary reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both universities are in the
        same city (Raleigh), it doesn't explicitly state they are at the exact same
        latitude or position. Being in the same city doesn't necessarily mean identical
        positions, and the model's reasoning is that one "cannot be directly south"
        of the other, not that they are at the exact same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result (not a refusal or inability

        universities are in the same city ("Since they are in the same city"), implying
        they are at the same location/latitude. This equality was explicitly stated
        as the reason why one cannot be strictly south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning suggests that since both universities
        are in the same city, they cannot be strictly south of each other. While this
        implies they are in roughly the same location, the model does not explicitly
        state they are at exactly/approximately equal latitudes. The reasoning is
        based on being in the same city rather than explicit equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to the comparative question, making this a clear NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer was that "both
        are in the same city, one cannot be directly south of the other." This explicitly
        indicates that their locations are effectively the same (within the same city)
        and this equality is the primary reason for the NO answer.

        the same city (Raleigh, NC), it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly
        the same latitude. Rather, it concludes NO because being in the same city
        means one cannot be directly south of the other, which is a different reasoning
        than exact equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it made its determination based on relative
        positions, noting that "17th st NW is east of Virginia Ave NW." The model
        identified a directional difference between the locations, even though it
        focused on east-west rather than north-south positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, making this a clear NO response.

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly noted a difference in their locations,
        explaining that the Corcoran Building (500) is further north than the GWU
        Medical Center (2300). The NO answer was based on this difference in location,
        not on equality.

        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, without any caveats about
        inability to determine or verify.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Everett being north of Seattle), not because the locations are equal. The
        model explicitly states there is a difference in position, with one being
        north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Washington Technology University is not south of Antioch
        University Seattle because Everett is north of Seattle.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Everett
        is north of Seattle, not because the locations are at the same position. It
        explicitly states a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on the relative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Everett is north of Seattle and concludes
        that Washington Technology University is north of Antioch University Seattle.
        The NO answer appears to be based on this difference in position, not on equality.

        indicating a directional difference, even if small. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was because one location
        was explicitly stated to be north of the other, indicating a difference in
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer, based on its reasoning that Washington Technology University
        is north of (not south of) Antioch University Seattle.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        or suggest that the locations were equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly
        stated that Everett is north of Seattle, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, but we're instructed
        to focus only on whether equality was explicitly stated as the reason for
        the NO answer, which it wasn't.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, making a clear comparative judgment based on its geographical analysis.
        While this appears to contradict its own reasoning (since it established one
        location is north of the other), we must take the explicit final answer at
        face value per instructions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Dickinson is west and slightly
        south of Jamestown" - indicating there is a difference in their positions
        (slightly south). The NO answer is not based on equal values, but rather on
        a detected difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9efcc08a-1eae-48c4-8104-cc50ea8bf043:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis determining that Dickinson is west and slightly south
        of Jamestown.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

    b9f3280c-da7e-42de-bfcb-efd0d6307b00:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model stated that Dickinson is "west and slightly
        south of Jamestown," indicating a clear directional difference between the
        locations. It did not state the locations were equal or the same, and the
        NO answer was based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after laying out its reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after reasoning
        about the relative positions of the universities

    fccb1c08-1c15-46ea-bc15-d2cee04f3929:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it determined that Dickinson is west of Jamestown and
        concluded NO based on its (incorrect) reasoning that west means north. The
        NO was based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
