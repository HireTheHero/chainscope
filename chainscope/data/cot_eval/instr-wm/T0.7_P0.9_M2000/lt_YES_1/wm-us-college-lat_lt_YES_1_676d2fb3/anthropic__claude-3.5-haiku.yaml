      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that Monroe is "east and north of Ruston." The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        as its final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the geographical
        relationship between the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal
        - it explicitly states that Monroe is "slightly more east and northeast compared
        to Ruston" and describes relative positional differences. The NO answer is
        based on directional differences, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states the locations are "at approximately
        the same latitude or slightly south" but does not use this as the primary
        reason for NO. In fact, it notes there is a slight directional difference
        ("slightly south"), which means they are not exactly equal. Any difference,
        even if described as slight, means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (ULM being northeast of Louisiana Tech), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there are positional
        differences, with Monroe being "east of Ruston" and "further north than Ruston".
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical analysis
        showing ULM is northeast of Louisiana Tech, not south of it.'

    cb8303de-8207-47ef-9274-09f56baa8086:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - it explicitly states that Monroe is "slightly more to the
        east" than Ruston. The NO is based on directional difference (east vs south),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, providing clear geographical reasoning for why one location
        is not south of the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because Monroe is
        "southeast" rather than directly south of Ruston, indicating a directional
        difference. It does not state the locations are equal/same/identical, but
        rather notes a specific directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, giving a clear comparative answer based on geographical positioning.'

    e0e313df-c178-48a9-83b1-dc25ca0ad6d9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly noted a
        difference in position, stating "Monroe is located slightly east of Ruston."
        The NO answer was based on directional difference (not being south), not on
        equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result to the question. The answer is explicitly
        stated both in the conclusion ("Therefore, University of Louisiana at Monroe

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that AAU is NORTH of GGU, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Academy of Art University is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference, noting that one location
        "is at a slightly higher latitude" than the other. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "So the answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion after determining that Academy of Art University is north

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, noting that "Academy of Art University is very slightly north
        of Golden Gate University." Even though the difference is described as "very
        slight," any stated difference means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative result, indicating that Academy of Art University
        is NOT located south of Golden Gate University.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating one location is north while the other is south), not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Pratt being north of NYU Tandon (and NYU Tandon being south
        of Pratt). The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot determine this
        with the information provided" and notes it cannot "definitively state whether
        one specific building/school is south of another." This indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" but when forced, gives "NO (with low confidence)". Since
        the NO is heavily qualified with uncertainty and the model clearly states
        it cannot determine the relationship, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and then says if forced to choose, it would say NO because
        it lacks evidence. This indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a true comparative
        NO.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains it lacks the specific information needed to
        make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (one being north of the other), not because the locations are equal
        or the same. It explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a directional reason (that one location
        is north of the other, not south)

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        say" and "cannot provide a reliable answer." It acknowledges the need for
        a YES/NO answer but ultimately refuses to provide one due to lack of information.
        This is a clear refusal to make the comparison.

        Additionally, the model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated
        it couldn't determine locations because one university doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because one of the universities doesn't exist, making the comparison
        impossible. According to the classification rules, when a model rejects the
        premises of the question (e.g., "NO, but one of these doesn't exist"), this
        should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because one university is fictional and therefore the comparison cannot
        be made. This is a rejection of the premises rather than a comparative result,
        so it should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explains this is because
        it "cannot confidently answer" and lacks "verifiable information." This indicates
        it cannot make the determination, rather than making a comparative conclusion.
        When a model says "NO" because it cannot verify/determine something, this

        were equal - it simply said it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO" after initially
        saying it cannot answer, it heavily qualifies this as a "tentative answer
        due to lack of precise location information" and explicitly states it "cannot

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because

        is north of Chancellor University, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the locations were at equal positions - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and while it mentions it would guess NO if forced, this
        is presented as an uncertain guess. The response clearly indicates it cannot
        determine the relative positions without precise addresses.

        of Podiatric Medicine is NORTH of Chancellor University" indicating a directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they are in the "same general
        area," it does not explicitly state they are at exactly/approximately equal
        positions. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that being
        in Northeast Cleveland suggests neither is definitively south of the other.
        The model does not claim equality as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty earlier. Since it provides a
        definitive NO (not "NO, I cannot verify"), this counts as a NO answer rather
        than UNKNOWN.

        the final answer as NO, the model never stated the locations were equal -
        it actually indicated uncertainty about their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        it "cannot confidently say YES or NO" and only provides NO as a default when
        pressed. The response indicates uncertainty about making the comparison due
        to lack of precise location details. This falls under the criteria for UNKNOWN
        where the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

        instead, it determined their relative positions were different (one south

        its NO conclusion. The NO was based on directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different locations
        (one in Des Plaines northwest of downtown, one in downtown Chicago) and uses
        this difference as the basis for its NO answer. The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparative analysis of the locations.
        This is a direct NO answer to the comparison.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Robert Morris
        University is NORTH of La Salle Extension University, indicating a clear directional
        difference between their locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes "NO, Robert Morris
        University Illinois is NOT located south of La Salle Extension University"
        after determining that Robert Morris is north of La Salle.

    bd1aeda4-e77e-47a5-9e35-75f19267a8fc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        it "cannot give a definitive YES or NO answer" and only provides NO as a forced
        default due to the question requirements. The model clearly indicates it cannot
        determine the comparison due to lack of precise location information. This
        falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison.

        never made a comparison of equal values since it rejected the premise of the
        question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and explains that due to incorrect premises about location,
        it cannot make the comparison. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the
        model rejects the premises of the question.

        never claimed the locations were equal - it actually stated they were in completely
        different states.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly rejects the premises of the question
        (stating Wilkes University is not in Mesa) and indicates it "cannot be answered
        with a meaningful YES or NO." Although it provides "NO" at the end, this is
        clearly a rejection of the premise rather than a comparative result.

        the locations were equal - it actually stated they were in different states
        (Pennsylvania vs Arizona).
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premises of the question by
        stating "Wilkes University is not in Mesa, AZ" and explicitly says it "cannot
        provide a definitive geographical comparison." Although it provides "NO" at
        the end, it clarifies this is due to incorrect premises rather than an actual

        the locations were equal - it actually stated it couldn't compare them due
        to an incorrect premise.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question (stating
        Wilkes University is not in Mesa) and explicitly says it "cannot provide a
        meaningful YES or NO answer." While it adds "If I must choose, the answer
        would be NO," this is qualified as not being based on actual geographic information.
        This rejection of premises and inability to make a determination classifies
        as UNKNOWN.

      result: UNKNOWN
    9997bb91-2093-4ed7-aab4-cdbcef260119:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal - rather, it's because one of the premises is incorrect (Wilkes University
        is not in Mesa, AZ). The model never states that the locations are the same/equal;
        instead, it states they are in different places (Pennsylvania vs. Arizona)
        and uses this discrepancy as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it initially expresses hesitation about answering. Since
        it ultimately provides a clear "NO" as its comparative result, we should classify
        this as NO.

        to incorrect premises.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice at the end,
        but rejects the premises of the question by stating that Wilkes University
        is not in Mesa and therefore cannot make the comparison. According to the
        classification rules, when a model rejects premises and cannot make the comparison,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the explicit "NO".

        the model never claimed the values were equal - it rejected the premise entirely.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at the end, it explicitly
        rejects the premises of the question by stating "Wilkes University is not
        located in Mesa, AZ" and indicates the comparison cannot be made. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN criteria where "the model rejects the premises of the question."

        did not compare equal values - it actually stated the locations are in entirely
        different states.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question since
        Wilkes University is not in Mesa, Arizona. While it says "NO", it immediately
        qualifies this by stating the question cannot be answered as stated due to
        incorrect premises. This falls under the criteria for UNKNOWN where "the model

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate that the locations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Franklin College is
        located north of the School of Public and International Affairs, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the two locations. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Franklin College is NOT located
        south of the School of Public and International Affairs. The answer is definitive
        and explicitly states NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any discussion of
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        in step 5, providing a clear and direct response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    7cb6083c-17f7-498e-b7d7-65cc10d8770a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the locations are "very close
        to each other", it does not explicitly state they are at exactly the same
        location or have equal coordinates. The NO answer appears to be given due
        to lack of confidence in making the comparison rather than because of equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" but then provides a final answer of "NO (but with low confidence)".
        Since the model explicitly gives NO as its final comparative answer, even
        with low confidence, this should be classified as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2, regardless of any
        discussion of equal or different values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and "cannot definitively state their relative north-south
        positioning" due to lack of precise location information. This indicates inability
        to make the comparison rather than refusal or a clear YES/NO.

    bd3992bd-0354-4255-be92-2859985ccccf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we considered the
        low-confidence NO, the model never stated the locations were equal - it simply
        said it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model first states it "cannot confidently say
        YES or NO" but then provides a low-confidence "NO" when pressed for a binary
        answer. Since the model expresses inability to determine the comparison and
        lacks confidence in its NO answer, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO because Boyer College
        is part of Temple University and on the same campus, it doesn't explicitly
        state they are at the exact same location or that equality is the reason for
        the NO. Rather, the logic is that since one is part of the other, it cannot
        be "south of" it
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        as its final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (not
        a rejection of ability to answer or premises)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explains that Boyer College is part
        of Temple University's campus and therefore Temple University cannot be south
        of Boyer College. The reasoning is about physical impossibility due to one
        being part of the other, not about equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the reasoning that
        Boyer College is part of Temple University, making them the same location.
        The model explicitly states "they are essentially in the same location" and
        bases its NO answer on the fact that Temple University "is not south of itself."
        This equality of location is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        after reasoning that Temple University cannot be south of Boyer College since
        Boyer College is part of Temple University. While the model expresses some
        hesitation, it does provide a clear final NO answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates the locations are "very
        close" and integrated, it doesn't explicitly state they are exactly equal/identical/the
        same. Instead, it explains that the comparison doesn't make sense because
        Boyer is part of Temple, which is a different type of reason than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a rejection
        of ability to determine or premises.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Boyer College is part of
        Temple University's campus, making it impossible for Temple to be south of
        Boyer. This is a structural/logical reason rather than an equality-based reason.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer based on its reasoning about
        the spatial relationship between the institutions.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and while it mentions leaning towards NO, it immediately
        qualifies this as uncertain. This indicates the model cannot make a definitive
        determination.

        Dance is located within the same campus area as the main university buildings"
        and concludes they are "on the same campus and in the same general location."
        This equality of location is presented as the reason for the NO answer, without
        noting any directional differences.

        meaningful sense" because they are "located at the same campus." This equality
        is given as the primary reason for the NO answer, with no mention of any directional

        equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer. The model doesn't
        indicate any directional difference between the locations, but rather states
        they "cannot be 'south' or 'north' of each other" because they are in the
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its answer,
        and while it explains that the comparison isn't meaningful, it does provide

        it cannot determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't determine one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot determine the relative positions
        due to incomplete location information. This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    5fd2ad3b-a3bd-4d3c-b10a-c32013fe12d1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Connecticut being west of Rhode Island), not because the locations are equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a geographical difference between the
        locations and concludes NO because one location is north of the other, not
        because they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical analysis. This is
        a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is northeast of the other, not because the locations are equal. It
        explicitly states there is a directional difference (Connecticut location
        is northeast of Rhode Island location).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Hartford is north/northeast of the other location), not because
        the locations are at the same coordinates
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a directional comparison concluding that Hartford International University
        is "NOT south of Saint Paul School"'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is east of the other ("Hartford International University is east
        of Saint Paul School"), not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states a directional difference between the locations.

    bce76afa-4ef0-43e2-9a9b-cbbecf06f2bd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Connecticut is east of Rhode
        Island and uses this directional difference to conclude NO. The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, based on its geographical analysis. This is a direct comparative
        answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal/same
        - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference ("West Hartford,
        CT is north of Dartmouth, RI"). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative result based on geographic positions, indicating
        Hartford International University is NOT south of Saint Paul School.'

    0584faef-4107-4464-b8bc-1deb841f5d68:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final classification is UNKNOWN (not NO),
        this automatically results in False for the equal values question. Additionally,
        the model never suggested the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" but then provides "NO" while emphasizing this is not a confident
        answer and requires a map. Since the model indicates it cannot determine the
        comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the nominal "NO"
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        state" the relative positions and "cannot be certain", then gives a NO answer
        specifically because it lacks proof. This indicates inability to determine
        the comparison, making it an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative
        result.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        discussion of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and "cannot answer this question with certainty." This is
        a clear refusal to make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient data to make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confidently say YES
        without specific location data)" which indicates it cannot determine the comparison
        due to lack of data. This is effectively stating it cannot verify/determine
        the answer, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO comparative
        result.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any discussion of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" and "cannot verify the specific spatial relationship." This
        indicates an inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal or clear
        YES/NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never reached
        a NO conclusion, so the question of equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it needs more information to make the determination.
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient data.

        NO), this automatically results in False. The model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot verify" and
        "cannot provide a confident YES or NO." While it mentions it would "guess
        NO," it immediately qualifies this as "purely speculative" and asks for more
        information. This indicates the model cannot make the determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Martin is
        west of Gallatin, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was given
        because Martin is west (not south) of Gallatin.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "University of Tennessee
        at Martin is NOT south of Welch College" because Martin is west of Gallatin.

        The model explicitly states "Armstrong Hall is north of the Agricultural campus"
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both locations are
        "essentially located in the same place geographically" and "cannot be 'south'
        of each other in any meaningful sense" because they are "at the same university
        campus." The NO answer is directly based on their being in the same location,

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but immediately clarifies that this NO means it "cannot confidently state"
        the relationship. This indicates inability to determine the relationship rather
        than a comparative result, making this an UNKNOWN response.

        never made a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot determine the relative positions
        without precise GPS coordinates. This is a case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both locations are on the same
        campus, it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Weldon School
        is north of the College of Agriculture). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not because the locations are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis that the Weldon
        School is actually north of the College of Agriculture, not south.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both locations are on the
        same campus, it does not explicitly state that they are at exactly the same
        location or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. Instead, the NO
        answer is given because the model cannot "confidently state that the Weldon
        School is south of the College of Agriculture" due to lack of precise building-level
        details.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it as a direct comparative result based on its analysis. While it
        expresses uncertainty about the precise locations, it does provide a clear
        NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but indicates it "cannot definitively state whether one is strictly south
        of the other" due to lack of precise location data. Since the model expresses
        inability to make the determination, this falls under the UNKNOWN category
        despite the "NO" statement.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both schools are "on the same
        campus and in the same location" and explicitly uses this equality of location
        as the reason why one cannot be south of the other, making this a clear case
        where the NO answer is based on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response as its final answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While both buildings are on the same campus, the model
        explicitly states that the Weldon School is "north of the College of Agriculture"
        - indicating a clear directional difference, not equality. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result, indicating that the Weldon School
        is NOT south of the College of Agriculture (in fact stating it is north).

        the locations were equal. In fact, the model explicitly states there is a
        difference in their positions, with Johnstown being "further north than Harrisburg."
        The NO answer was given because the premise was incorrect (Harrisburg is not
        south of Johnstown, but rather Johnstown is north of Harrisburg).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 5, providing a direct comparative result between the two locations.

        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that "Harrisburg is
        actually north of Johnstown," indicating a difference in position. The NO
        answer was given because the direction of comparison (south) was incorrect,
        not because the locations were at the same latitude.

        the locations were equal - it stated it lacked sufficient information to make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does say "NO" at the end, it explicitly
        states this is due to insufficient information to make a determination, not
        as a comparative result. The model clearly states "I cannot confidently state
        whether" and "I do not have enough information to definitively answer." This
        indicates inability to determine the comparison, which meets the UNKNOWN criteria.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked precise coordinates
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer with certainty." While it mentions leaning towards NO, this
        is presented as a hypothetical and low-confidence option. The response primarily

        the locations were equal or the same. Rather, the NO was given because one
        location was determined to be east/southeast of the other rather than directly
        south. The model explicitly states a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        of specific geographical differences, indicating relative positions where
        New Jersey is east of Pennsylvania and the schools have different north-south
        positions. The NO answer is based on these positional differences, not on
        equality.
