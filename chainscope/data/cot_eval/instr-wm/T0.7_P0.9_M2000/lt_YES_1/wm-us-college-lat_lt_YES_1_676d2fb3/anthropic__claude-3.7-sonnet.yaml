      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explains that the universities are at "approximately
        the same latitude" and "at the same north-south position," indicating that
        the equal latitudinal position is the primary reason for the NO answer. The
        model states they are "at approximately the same latitude, with ULM being
        east of Louisiana Tech" - the east-west difference is mentioned but doesn't
        contradict the equality in the north-south dimension being compared.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, University of Louisiana
        at Monroe is not located south of Louisiana Tech University." This is a clear
        negative answer to the comparative question.

    bef01c9f-94fa-4092-b4bb-8f0a8fce8f2c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer based on equal values - it actually gave a YES answer
        after correcting its analysis.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer. The final statement
        reads "YES" after the model realized its error and concluded that "University
        of Louisiana at Monroe is located SOUTH of Louisiana Tech University."

      result: 'YES'
    cec1a0b8-6652-471c-9f9a-15b1506ea8ac:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that the universities are "at approximately
        the same latitude" and "essentially at the same latitude," but it also notes
        that "Monroe is actually very slightly south of Ruston." Since the model acknowledges
        a slight difference in position (even if described as very slight), this is
        not a case where the values are exactly equal. The NO answer is based on the
        difference not being "meaningful" rather than the positions being identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its final answer, indicating that "University of Louisiana at Monroe is
        not meaningfully south of Louisiana Tech University." This is a clear negative
        response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    d1b0b4c4-76e5-4d43-9f2c-f2d08b3139b4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it states that ULM is "slightly east and a bit south, but primarily
        east of Louisiana Tech." This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
        The model is saying NO because the primary directional relationship is east,
        not south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - University of Louisiana
        at Monroe is not south of Louisiana Tech University." This is a clear negative
        answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f6908e9b-215f-4e8a-9f90-e92340314b16:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response, clearly indicating that it believes ULM is south of Louisiana
        Tech University.'

    05d96192-8d97-488b-8f04-5e6ac34dce9a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Academy of Art
        University is actually slightly north and east of Golden Gate University."
        The model is indicating a directional difference between the two locations,
        not equality. The reason for the NO answer is that one university is north
        of the other, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "Academy of
        Art University is NOT south of Golden Gate University" and provides its final
        answer as "NO" at the end of its response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    45f4eb1b-9821-4e85-bd21-713bad409d80:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Academy of Art University
        is actually located slightly north of Golden Gate University within San Francisco."
        This indicates a difference in location (one is north of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Academy of Art University
        is not located south of Golden Gate University." This is a clear negative
        answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    47746a2a-f551-4efc-9efa-2a652277433c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Academy of Art University is
        "slightly NORTH of Golden Gate University." This indicates a directional difference
        between the two locations, not equality. The model's NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It first says "NO - Academy of Art University is not located south of Golden
        Gate University" and then confirms this with "So the correct answer is: NO"
        at the end of its response.'

        question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself, stating "YES" as its final answer. The model explicitly states "Academy
        of Art University is south of Golden Gate University, so the answer should
        be: YES" as its final conclusion.'

    4fa73679-a364-406f-8679-94fa49583817:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it determines that Golden Gate University is south of
        Academy of Art University, indicating a difference in their locations. The
        model specifically states "Golden Gate University is actually south of Academy
        of Art University, not the other way around" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations of both universities and determining that Golden
        Gate University is south of Academy of Art University, not the other way around.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    b0e1d40d-ee9a-411d-ab13-7011dce9442e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Golden Gate University
        is actually south of Academy of Art University's main campus," indicating
        a difference in their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to the original
        question (which appears to have asked if Academy of Art University is further
        south than Golden Gate University).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b2de3717-6635-4502-9d9e-537f68a87d45:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Academy of Art
        University is indeed south (and slightly east) of Golden Gate University,"
        indicating a difference in location. The NO answer contradicts this reasoning,
        but nowhere does the model claim the locations are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which contradicts its reasoning that "Academy of Art University is indeed
        south (and slightly east) of Golden Gate University." Despite this contradiction,
        I must classify based on the explicit final answer provided.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    bb98b2a4-5376-4904-92c0-9a8a5bf79eeb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Academy of Art University being north of Golden Gate University,
        not south. The model gives a directional difference as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "Academy of
        Art University is NOT south of Golden Gate University; rather, it's north
        of it."
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c83e7449-a9d7-4105-b4e4-ed34e4587be8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are exactly equal. Instead, it says they are "in approximately the same area"
        and "at similar latitude" with "some Academy of Art buildings slightly north."
        This indicates a slight difference in position rather than exact equality,
        even though they are described as very close to each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the
        response without qualifications.

        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially stated "NO" but then recognized
        its contradiction and corrected its answer to "YES, Academy of Art University
        is located south of Golden Gate University." The final answer provided was
        clearly "YES".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Pratt Institute
        is located northeast of NYU Tandon, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The reason for the NO answer is that Pratt is northeast,
        not south, of NYU Tandon.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Pratt Institute is not
        located south of NYU Tandon School of Engineering. It is located northeast
        of it." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Pratt Institute
        is located north of NYU Tandon, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Pratt Institute is not
        located south of NYU Tandon School of Engineering. It is located north of
        it." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Clinton Hill is
        located east and slightly south of Downtown Brooklyn" and "NYU Tandon is further
        north than Pratt Institute." The model concludes that "Pratt Institute is
        located south of NYU Tandon School of Engineering," indicating a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which directly responds to the comparative question. The model has provided
        a clear negative response to the comparison.

        the same latitude, with Sonoma State being slightly north." The model notes
        a directional difference (Sonoma State being "slightly north"), which means
        it's not claiming equality as the reason for the NO answer.

        is very slightly south of Oakland City University" in point 4, indicating
        a difference in position (even if described as "very slightly"). The model
        acknowledges they are at "roughly the same latitude" but then specifies a
        directional difference, which contradicts equality as the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the Askew School is actually a department within the College, making
        the comparison inappropriate from an organizational perspective. The model
        explains that "they're part of the same institutional structure" and that
        one being south of the other wouldn't be "accurate in a meaningful geographic
        sense" because of their organizational relationship, not because they have
        identical geographic coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly indicates that it's not accurate

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Askew School is a department
        within the College of Social Sciences, and they are housed in the same building
        but on different floors. The reason for the NO answer is based on an organizational
        relationship (one being part of the other) rather than equal geographical
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Florida State University
        College of Social Sciences is not located south of the Askew School of Public

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are exactly equal or identical. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is
        because the Askew School is a department within the College, and they occupy
        the same location or buildings on campus. The model is explaining a containment
        relationship rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the Askew School is a department within the College of Social Sciences, making
        them not separate geographic entities where one could be south of the other.
        The reason for the NO is based on an organizational relationship rather than

        within the College of Social Sciences, and they "essentially share the same
        location, with the Askew School being a subset of the College." The model
        is indicating that they are not separate geographic entities but rather the
        same location (with one being a subset of the other), and this is the primary
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Florida State University

        within the College of Social Sciences and Public Policy, and they are "essentially
        in the same location" and "in the same general area." The model's NO answer
        is based on the fact that the College is not located south of one of its own
        departments because they are in the same location. This indicates the values
        being compared (the locations) are the same.

        within the College of Social Sciences, and they "share the same location."
        The model states they're not separate geographic entities and that "one is
        contained within the other." The primary reason for the NO answer is that
        they share the same location/are in the same place, which means they have
        equal geographic positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

        within the College of Social Sciences and Public Policy, and therefore they
        cannot have a south/north relationship because one is contained within the
        other. The reason for the NO is based on organizational structure, not equality

        within the College of Social Sciences and Public Policy, describing a hierarchical
        relationship rather than equality. The model's reasoning is based on organizational
        structure (part-whole relationship) rather than equal physical locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - The Florida State

        not give a NO answer based on equal values - it actually concluded the locations
        were different (one south of the other).
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer. The final determination

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Schiller International University
        is NOT south of The University of Tampa. It's actually slightly north." The
        model is indicating a difference in position (Schiller being slightly north),
        not equality of position.

        is very slightly further north than Eugene, OR" and later saying "Bushnell
        University being very slightly north or at virtually the same latitude as
        Winona State." Since the model notes a difference (even if described as slight)
        rather than stating they are exactly equal, and this difference is part of
        its reasoning, the answer is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Bushnell University

        being fractionally south." Even though it describes the difference as "minimal"
        and "negligible," it still acknowledges a directional difference (slightly
        south), which means it's not considering the values to be exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final answer.
        While it does note that the difference is "minimal" and "negligible," it still

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that "Francis Marion University
        is at a similar latitude or slightly north of the California institution,"
        indicating there is a potential difference in position. The model is noting
        a possible directional difference (slightly north), not equality, as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Francis Marion University
        in South Carolina is not located south of California Pacific School of Theology
        in California." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal. In fact, it suggests that Francis Marion University is "likely
        slightly north or at a similar latitude" compared to California Pacific School
        of Theology. Even the "similar latitude" possibility is presented as an alternative
        to being "slightly north," not as the primary reason for the NO answer. The
        model indicates there is a directional difference (east) and possibly a slight
        latitude difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Francis Marion University
        in South Carolina is NOT located south of California Pacific School of Theology

        The model's reasoning indicates a clear directional difference (one is south
        of the other), not equality. The "NO" answer appears to be inconsistent with
        the reasoning provided, but I'm evaluating only what was stated, not resolving
        contradictions.

        (the locations) are equal, identical, or the same. In fact, it explicitly
        stated they are in different locations (Coral Gables vs. downtown Miami) and
        even concluded in step 4 that "University of Miami is indeed located south
        of Miami International University of Art & Design." The model gave a NO answer
        that contradicts its own reasoning, but it did not claim equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This directly contradicts its own reasoning in
        step 4 where it stated "University of Miami is indeed located south of Miami
        International University of Art & Design." Despite this contradiction, I must

        - that the University of Miami is located south of Miami International University
        of Art & Design. This difference in location is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        followed by an explanation that "The University of Miami is located south

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, it contradicts itself - first
        saying "North Chicago is slightly further north than Framingham" but then
        concluding "with Framingham State being slightly south or approximately at
        the same latitude." Either way, it notes a slight difference in the latitudes
        rather than stating they are exactly equal as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Framingham State
        University in MA is NOT located south of Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine
        and Science in IL." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer based on equal values - it actually gave a YES answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then reconsidered
        and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer. The model's final conclusion
        was that "Framingham State University is actually slightly SOUTH of Rosalind
        Franklin University of Medicine and Science" with a clear "YES" at the end.

        NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, indicating that it believes Framingham State University,

        saying "Lake Charles is slightly south of Lafayette" but then concluding "McNeese
        State (in Lake Charles) is very slightly north of UL Lafayette." Regardless
        of this contradiction, the model is claiming there is a directional difference
        (even if tiny), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. McNeese State University
        is not located south of University of Louisiana at Lafayette." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not claim the values are exactly equal
        as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, it contradicts itself - first saying
        Lake Charles is slightly south of Lafayette (step 4), but then in the conclusion
        saying McNeese State is "very slightly north of UL Lafayette, or essentially
        at the same latitude with a negligible difference." Since it mentions a directional
        difference (even if tiny), this doesn't qualify as stating they are exactly
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its final answer paragraph. It clearly indicates that McNeese State University
        is not south of University of Louisiana at Lafayette.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly notes a difference, stating "Lake Charles (McNeese
        State) is very slightly north of Lafayette (UL Lafayette) by a tiny margin."
        Even though the difference is described as "very slightly" and "tiny," the
        model is still identifying a difference rather than equality.

        is NOT south of University of Louisiana at Lafayette. It's actually slightly
        north and considerably west of it." The model is noting a difference in position
        (slightly north), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether McNeese State University is south of University of Louisiana at

        indicating a slight difference rather than exact equality. This slight directional
        difference is part of the reason for the NO answer.

        the model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that it cannot determine the

        to determine their relative positions. The model states "Without the specific
        street addresses to compare, I cannot definitively state which was further
        south within Chicago." This indicates uncertainty about their relative positions,
        not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it explains that it cannot determine the relative positions due to insufficient

        of Fort Lee, VA by a small margin" and that "Evangel University in Missouri
        is technically slightly south of Army Logistics University in Virginia." Even
        though it notes they are "at almost the same latitude" and "very close," it
        clearly identifies a difference in position, with one being "slightly south"
        of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clear and definitive at the end
        of the response.

        Theological Union is north of Goldman School), not equality, as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question about whether Goldman School of Public Policy

        indicates a directional difference (one is north of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Goldman School of

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that Goldman
        School of Public Policy is south of Graduate Theological Union ("Goldman is
        south of GTU"), indicating the locations are different. The model notes a
        clear directional difference between the two locations, with one being downhill
        from the other. The NO answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning,
        but it does not claim the locations have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is confusing because the reasoning suggests that Goldman School
        of Public Policy IS south of Graduate Theological Union (stating "Goldman
        is south of GTU"), which would logically lead to a "YES" answer. However,
        I must analyze only what was explicitly stated, and the model explicitly concluded
        with "NO" as its final answer.

        Public Policy" and "the Goldman School of Public Policy is located south of
        the Graduate Theological Union." The model is clearly indicating a directional
        difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are the same or equal. Instead, it explains that the two institutions overlap
        and are integrated parts of the same campus, with Franklin College spanning
        multiple buildings. The reason for the NO answer is that they don't have a
        clear north-south relationship due to their overlapping nature, not because
        they are in the exact same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        relationship. The model indicates they occupy different buildings or areas
        within the same campus, but doesn't claim they have identical locations. The
        reason for the NO is that they don't have "a clear north-south relationship"
        rather than being in the exact same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are exactly equal or identical. Instead, it explains that they are both part
        of the same campus, occupy multiple buildings, and have overlapping areas.
        The model describes them as "co-located" and in the "same general area" but
        doesn't claim they have identical locations. The reason for the NO is that
        they occupy multiple buildings in overlapping areas rather than one being
        south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its final answer, indicating that Franklin College of Arts and Sciences

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its final answer, but then explains that the question is based on a misconception
        because both institutions are academic units within the same university rather
        than separate geographic locations. Since the model is rejecting the premise
        of the question (that these are separate geographic entities that can be compared
        directionally), this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        one. The model's reasoning is that since Boyer College is within Temple University,
        the university as a whole cannot be exclusively south of the college. This
        is not an equality claim but a rejection of the directional comparison based
        on the containment relationship.

        The reason for the NO is not that the locations are identical, but rather
        that the relationship between them is not one of separate geographic entities
        that can be compared directionally. The model uses an analogy of "asking if
        a room is south of the house it's in" to explain why the comparison doesn't

        but then in its conclusion stating that Western Illinois University is "actually
        located very slightly north of Illinois Wesleyan University." In either case,
        it's indicating a difference in position (either slightly south or slightly
        north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Western Illinois University is located south of Illinois Wesleyan

        quite close in terms of latitude." This indicates a difference in position,
        not equality, as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains contradictory information.
        In Step 4, it states "Macomb is slightly south of Bloomington" but in the
        final conclusion it states "Western Illinois University is not located south
        of Illinois Wesleyan University. It's actually located very slightly north
        of Illinois Wesleyan University." The model explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal as the reason for its NO answer. While it notes they are at "very similar
        latitudes," it specifically states that "Sul Ross being slightly north of
        LSU" as the reason for its NO answer. This indicates a difference in values
        (Sul Ross is slightly north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly indicates that "Sul Ross State
        University in Texas is not south of Louisiana State University Business Education

        Education Complex." The model notes a difference in position (slightly south),
        even though it acknowledges the latitudes are "very similar." Since the model
        identifies a directional difference rather than equality as the reason for
        its NO answer, this is False.

        it describes them as "approximately the same latitude" and "almost at the

        south), which means it's not claiming exact equality as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model initially states that "These universities

        contradicts itself by saying "Fairleigh Dickinson is very slightly south of
        Mount Union" in step 5, but in the final answer claims "Fairleigh Dickinson
        being very slightly north if anything." Despite the contradiction, the model
        is indicating a difference in position (either slightly north or slightly
        south), not exact equality. Since the model notes a directional difference,
        even if described as "very slightly," this is not a case where the NO answer
        is based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Fairleigh Dickinson

        Union" but then concluding "with FDU possibly being slightly north." This
        inconsistency and mention of slight differences (whether north or south) means
        the model is not basing its NO answer on the values being exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Fairleigh Dickinson

        one college is west of the other, not that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - North Dakota State
        College of Science is not located south of Minnesota State Community and Technical

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not say the values are exactly equal.
        Instead, it states "They are at approximately the same latitude, with NDSCS
        being west of M State." The model indicates they are at "approximately" the
        same latitude but still notes a directional difference (west vs. east). Since
        it notes a positional difference rather than stating they are identical, this
        doesn't qualify as equal values being the primary reason for the NO answer.

        its conclusion that "they are at similar latitudes, with neither being significantly
        south of the other." This indicates the model is saying the values (latitudes)
        are approximately equal or the same, and this equality is the primary reason

        that the values being compared (their north-south positions) are the same,
        which is why one is not south of the other. This equality is the primary reason
        given for the NO answer.

        south of Moorhead" and that they are "at similar latitudes" with NDSCS being
        "approximately at the same latitude or slightly south of M State's Moorhead
        campus." The model indicates there is some difference in position, even if
        it's described as slight, rather than stating they are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, North Dakota State

        latitudes" and that they "would generally be at similar latitudes," which
        indicates approximate similarity but not exact equality. The model's reasoning
        is based on the general east-west orientation of the border between the states,
        not on the colleges being at identical latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its final answer, indicating that North Dakota State College of Science
        is not located south of Minnesota State Community and Technical College. This
        is a clear negative comparative result.

        of some M State campuses and slightly south of others, depending on which
        specific campus location is being referenced." This indicates differences
        in relative positions, not equality, as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO
        - North Dakota State College of Science is not located south of Minnesota

        in adjacent states that are positioned east-west of each other. The model
        specifically notes a directional difference (North Dakota to the west and
        Minnesota to the east) rather than claiming the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, North Dakota State

        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - North Dakota State
        College of Science is not located south of Minnesota State Community and Technical

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison doesn't make
        geographical sense because the College of Sciences is a part of ASU's campus.
        The model states "the College of Sciences is a part of Angelo State University
        and is located within the university's campus." This indicates a containment
        relationship rather than equality. The reason for the NO is that it's "not
        geographically meaningful" to compare the whole to its part in this way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Angelo State University
        is not located south of Angelo State University College of Sciences" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        "the College of Sciences is a part of Angelo State University, not a separate
        geographical location." The model is rejecting the premise that these are
        two separate locations that can be compared directionally, not claiming they
        are at the same coordinates or equal in position.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the relationship between
        the two entities is one of containment (the College of Sciences is part of
        Angelo State University), not cardinal direction. The model states "neither
        entity can be definitively said to be south of the other" because one is contained
        within the other, not because they have equal geographic coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Angelo State University

        Sciences is part of Angelo State University and exists within its geographical
        boundaries, creating a containment relationship rather than a directional
        one. The model is rejecting the premise of a directional relationship, not

        "the College of Sciences is a part of Angelo State University, not a separate
        location" and that it's a "logical impossibility" for the whole to be south
        of its part. The reason for the NO is based on a containment relationship,
        not equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Georgia Military
        College is indeed slightly south of Georgia College & State University." The
        model is indicating a difference in position (one is slightly south of the
        other), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question.

    f6cbeaed-b98c-4a07-b085-9980f3aed26d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that GMC is "actually located
        slightly southeast of GCSU, with GMC being more eastern than directly southern
        in relation to GCSU." This indicates a difference in position (southeast rather
        than directly south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Georgia Military
        College is not located south of Georgia College & State University." This
        is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that "Corcoran
        College of Art and Design was located south of the George Washington University
        School of Nursing." The model is indicating a difference in location (one
        is south of the other), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it determined that the Corcoran College
        location is south of the GWU School of Nursing location, indicating a difference
        in their positions. The model specifically states "the Corcoran College location
        (500 17th St NW) is south of GWU School of Nursing location (1919 Pennsylvania
        Ave NW)" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "It's actually slightly north
        of it," indicating a difference in the relative positions (Corcoran is north
        of GWU, not south). The NO is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Corcoran College
        of Art and Design is not located south of George Washington University School
        of Nursing." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "the Corcoran was actually located
        north of the National Mall but south of the GWU School of Nursing," indicating
        a specific directional difference between the two locations. The model is
        giving NO as an answer because it believes the Corcoran is not south of GWU,
        but rather is south of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Corcoran College
        of Art and Design is not south of George Washington University School of Nursing."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a different directional relationship
        as the reason for its NO answer, stating "It is actually southeast of it."
        This indicates a specific directional difference (southeast rather than south),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Corcoran College
        of Art and Design is not south of George Washington University School of Nursing."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        St NW) was slightly south of GWU School of Nursing (1919 Pennsylvania Ave
        NW)". The model identifies a directional difference (slightly south), which
        is the reason for its NO answer. Even though it mentions they are "at approximately
        the same north-south line" earlier, it ultimately concludes there is a difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response, indicating that Corcoran College of Art and Design

        compared (the latitudes) are the same, which is the primary reason for the
        NO answer. While it mentions "If anything, Pfeiffer University might be very
        slightly north," it presents this as a minimal difference and not the main
        reason for the NO answer.

        which indicates a difference in values, not equality. The model is saying
        NO because Lima is north (not south) of NYC, not because they're at the same
        latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Ohio State University, Lima Campus is south of the School of Visual
        Arts. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer to whether Dickinson
        State University is located south of University of Jamestown.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states "Dickinson is slightly south of Jamestown by
        a small margin" despite noting they have "very similar latitudes." The model
        identifies a difference in position, even if small, rather than equality as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially made an error in its analysis,
        stating "NO" and claiming Dickinson was north of Jamestown. However, it then
        corrected itself and explicitly stated "YES. Dickinson State University is
        located south of University of Jamestown, ND" as its final answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a "NO" answer, but then recognized
        an error in its reasoning and corrected itself to "YES" as its final answer.
        The final statement was "YES" after the model realized that lower latitude
        in the northern hemisphere means further south.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model ultimately
        concluded that Dickinson State University is slightly south of University
        of Jamestown, not that they are equal in latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a "NO" answer, but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "YES, Dickinson State University is located south
        of University of Jamestown, though only slightly." This final correction represents
        the model's ultimate answer to the question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
