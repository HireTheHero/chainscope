    2384814a-5fdf-46e9-ab65-81bae902a8d7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison doesn't
        make sense because the Askew School is organizationally contained within the
        College. The model states they are "essentially in the same location" but
        the primary reason for the NO is that one is a subset of the other, not that
        they have equal geographic coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - It's not accurate
        to say the College is south of the Askew School, as the Askew School is a
        department within the College itself." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that the
        entities "share the same physical location" and "exist in the same building
        rather than in separate geographical locations." The model explicitly states
        they "share the same physical location" and "one cannot be meaningfully described
        as south of the other" because they are in the same building. This indicates
        the values being compared (their locations) are the same, and this equality
        is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Florida State University College of Social Sciences

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it states that
        the Askew School is a department within the College of Social Sciences, and
        they are "effectively in the same location on FSU's campus." The model explicitly
        states "they are not separate institutions in different locations" and that
        "it doesn't make geographical sense to say one is south of the other." The
        model is indicating they are in the same location, which is the primary reason
        for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explains that the Askew School is a department
        within the Florida State University College of Social Sciences and Public
        Policy, and they share the same physical location on FSU's campus. The model
        states "they are essentially in the same location" and "it wouldn't be accurate
        to describe one as being south of the other." The NO answer is based on the
        fact that the locations are the same, not that one is in a different direction.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explains that the Askew School is a department
        within the College of Social Sciences, sharing the same location. The model
        states "it's not accurate to say one is south of the other" because they are
        not separate geographic entities, not because they are at equal coordinates.
        The model is rejecting the premise that they can be compared directionally
        since one is organizationally contained within the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Askew School is a sub-unit
        of the College of Social Sciences and Public Policy, making them part of the
        same organizational structure rather than separate geographic entities. The
        model's reasoning is based on their hierarchical relationship, not on them
        having equal geographic coordinates.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that the
        Askew School is a department within the College of Social Sciences and Public
        Policy, and they share the same physical location (Bellamy Building). The
        model states they are "effectively co-located" and "in the same location"
        - indicating they are in the same place, which is why one cannot be south
        of the other. This equality of location is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that one location is not south of the other. This is
        a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        "the Askew School is actually part of the College of Social Sciences, not
        a separate location." The model is rejecting the premise that they can be
        compared directionally because one is organizationally contained within the
        other, not because they have equal geographic coordinates or are in the same
        location (though it does mention they share the same physical location).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly indicates that "The Florida
        State University College of Social Sciences is not located south of the Askew
        School" which is a direct NO response to the original question.

        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison doesn't
        make geographical sense because the Askew School is a department within the
        College of Social Sciences and Public Policy. The model explains that "it
        doesn't make geographical sense to say one is south of the other" because
        of their organizational relationship, not because they have identical geographical
        coordinates.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "La Salle was actually slightly further
        south" and notes that "417 S. Dearborn Street (La Salle) has a higher number
        than 401 S. State Street (Robert Morris)," indicating a difference in their
        positions. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.

        were "essentially at the same latitude in downtown Chicago, with no significant
        'south of' relationship between them." This indicates the model is saying
        the values (latitudes) are effectively equal, which is the primary reason
        for the NO answer.

        the universities were "located very close to each other in downtown Chicago
        at approximately the same latitude." This indicates the model is saying the
        values (latitudes) are approximately equal/the same, and this equality is
        the primary reason for the NO answer. The model states they were "at approximately
        the same latitude" which indicates sameness rather than any difference in
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        stating "Since 417 is a higher number than 401 on these parallel south streets,
        La Salle Extension University was slightly more south than Robert Morris University
        Illinois." The model is clearly indicating a difference in position (one is
        "slightly more south" than the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        University would be "slightly further south" than Robert Morris University
        based on the street address numbers (417 vs 401). This difference in position
        is the reason for the NO answer.

        specifically states that "they have similar street numbers (401 vs. 417)"
        and were both located south of Madison Street. The equality of their positions
        is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        parts of the same campus with buildings in close proximity and some overlapping
        areas" and that there is "no clear north-south distinction between them."
        The model is indicating that the locations are complex and intermingled rather
        than identical, which is different from saying they have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - It would not be

      explanation_equal_values: The model explains that both institutions are part
        of the same university campus with buildings spread throughout the campus.
        The model states "they are both part of the same institution and have buildings
        throughout the shared campus rather than being distinct separate campuses,
        neither is wholly 'south' of the other." This indicates they share the same
        geographic space rather than being exactly equal or identical in location.
        The model is saying they are interspersed throughout the campus, not that
        they are at the exact same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, in point 7, it states "these schools have
        overlapping building locations, and neither is strictly south of the other."
        This indicates a more complex spatial relationship than equality - they have
        overlapping locations rather than being in the exact same position. The model
        is rejecting the premise that one is south of the other, not claiming they're
        in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Franklin College isn't concentrated
        in a single location but has departments across both North and South campuses,
        while SPIA is in Candler Hall on North Campus. The model describes them as
        "overlapping units" with "buildings and departments dispersed throughout campus,"
        making it "not accurate to say one is definitively south of the other." This
        indicates complexity in their spatial relationship rather than equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that both institutions are part
        of the same university campus and "aren't oriented in a strict north-south
        relationship to each other." The model is not claiming they are at the exact
        same location, but rather that the comparison isn't meaningful in the way
        the question suggests.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - it's not accurate
        to say Franklin College is located south of the School of Public and International

        buildings across campus with no clear single location, and that it has buildings
        both north and south of where SPIA is located. The reason for the NO answer
        is that there isn't a simple north-south relationship between them, not that
        they are in the same location.

        "don't have a clear north-south relationship" and are "parts of the same integrated
        campus with buildings scattered throughout." The model is not saying they
        are at the same location, but rather that their relationship doesn't fit a
        simple north-south comparison.

        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "neither is definitively
        'south' of the other" because "The Franklin College has departments and facilities
        across both North and South campuses of UGA, while SPIA is centered on North
        Campus." This indicates a complex spatial relationship rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Franklin College spans multiple
        locations across the entire UGA campus, including areas both north and south
        of SPIA's location. The reason for the NO answer is that Franklin College
        is not entirely south of SPIA (it spans multiple locations), not that they
        are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Franklin College

        is a part of Temple University itself, located within the same campus." The
        model explains they share the same physical location, which is the primary
        reason for the NO answer. The model is stating they are at the same location,
        not that one is slightly north/south of the other.

        are exactly equal or identical. Instead, it explains that Boyer College is
        a part of Temple University, which is a different relationship than equality.
        The model states "Boyer College is a school within Temple University" and
        "Boyer being part of Temple" which indicates a containment relationship rather
        than equality. The reason for the NO answer is that one entity is a component
        of the other, not that they have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Temple University

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Boyer College is part of
        Temple University and located on its campus. The reason for the NO answer
        is that "Boyer College is a constituent part of Temple University" (a whole-part
        relationship), not because they have equal geographical coordinates or identical
        locations. The model states "that would be like saying a whole is south of
        one of its parts" as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Temple University cannot

        being compared are equal or the same. Instead, the model explains that Boyer
        College is a part of Temple University (one is contained within the other),
        making the comparison invalid from a hierarchical perspective. The model states
        "they essentially share the same location" but this is presented as a consequence
        of their organizational relationship, not as the primary reason for the NO
        answer. The primary reason given is that "Boyer College is actually a part
        of Temple University itself."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Temple University,

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Boyer College is part of
        Temple University, meaning one is contained within the other. The model rejects
        the premise of the comparison rather than stating the locations are equal.
        The reason for the NO is that the comparison is invalid due to one entity
        being part of the other, not because they have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final answer,
        followed by an explanation that the question contains a false premise because
        Boyer College is part of Temple University. While the model rejects the premise

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison doesn't make
        sense because Boyer College is part of Temple University, making it a logical
        impossibility rather than an equality. The model argues that one entity is
        contained within the other, not that they are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Temple University

        the other. The model states "it doesn't make sense to say that Temple University
        is south of Boyer College because Temple University encompasses Boyer College."
        This is not claiming equality but rather explaining a containment relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        for the NO answer is that "Boyer College is contained within Temple University"
        and "Temple University cannot be south of Boyer College - that would be like
        saying a whole is south of its part." This is a containment relationship,

        rather than a separate location. The reason for the NO is not that the locations
        are identical, but that one is contained within the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Texas A&M College
        of Liberal Arts is not located south of Texas A&M University because it is
        part of Texas A&M University, not a separate geographic location." This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reason for saying NO is that "it is a
        component of the university itself rather than a separate geographical location."
        The model is explaining that they are not separate locations that can be compared
        directionally, but rather the College of Liberal Arts is part of the university.
        The model is not saying they have equal or identical geographical coordinates,
        but rather that the premise of the comparison is incorrect because one is
        contained within the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Texas A&M College
        of Liberal Arts is not located south of Texas A&M University" as its final

    ce54ba1c-9b4a-4e2c-bdbd-b4408e51ead5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the College of Liberal Arts
        is a component of Texas A&M University and exists within the university's
        campus, making the comparison illogical (like "asking if a room is south of
        the house it's in"). The reason for the NO is that one entity is part of the
        other, not that they have equal geographic coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Texas A&M College of Liberal Arts is not south of
        Texas A&M University. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the College of Liberal Arts is part of Texas A&M University, not a separate
        location that could be directionally positioned. The reason for the NO is
        that the comparison itself doesn't make sense (one entity is contained within
        the other), not that they have equal geographic coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly labeled as "# Answer: NO"

        same. Instead, it explains that the College of Liberal Arts is "a part of
        Texas A&M University, located within the same campus." The model is rejecting
        the premise that these are separate geographic entities that can be compared
        directionally. The reason for the NO is not that they have equal geographic
        coordinates, but that one is contained within the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Texas A&M College
        of Liberal Arts is not located south of Texas A&M University" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the College of Liberal Arts
        is a component or part of Texas A&M University (not equal to it), and that's
        why it cannot be south of the university. The model's reasoning is that one
        entity is contained within the other, not that they are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Texas A&M College of Liberal Arts is not located
        south of Texas A&M University. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

        clear comparative NO, but rather indicates an inability to determine the relationship
        due to lack of information about Sonnencroft's exact location. The model states

        equal as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, it contradicts itself - first
        stating "They are at nearly identical latitudes" (which might suggest equality),
        but then immediately claims "Mount Union being very slightly south of Fairleigh
        Dickinson" (indicating a difference). Since the model notes a difference in

        the university campus. The model's reasoning is based on a containment relationship
        (one being part of the other), not on equality of location. The model explains
        that "the university as a whole cannot be located south of one of its own
        components" because "the university encompasses the College of Sciences."

        is south (or north) of one of its own departments." The model is not saying
        the two locations have equal coordinates or are the same point geographically,

        illogical. The model states "they essentially share the same location" but
        this is not presented as the primary reason for the NO answer - rather, the

        is a directional difference (either north or south), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer based on equal values.

        after concluding that "Dickinson State University is located south of the
        University of Jamestown."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer, so we don't need to evaluate whether it was because the values
        were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Dickinson State University, ND located south of University
        of Jamestown, ND?" The model provides a clear affirmative response after analyzing
        the latitudes of both locations.

    d14a1f1f-a53d-470c-8288-c160756f12e0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal. Instead, it notes that "Dickinson is actually very slightly south of
        Jamestown, but the difference is minimal (less than 0.1 degree)." This indicates
        a small difference exists, not equality. Even though the model says they are
        at "nearly the same latitude," it still identifies a directional difference
        (Dickinson being slightly south), which means the values are not considered
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Dickinson State University is not south of University
        of Jamestown. This is a clear negative comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
