      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Monroe
        is "to the east and slightly north of Ruston," indicating a difference in
        location. The NO answer was given because the actual relationship is different
        from what was asked (north vs south), not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly marks it as "Final Answer: NO". The model makes a clear comparative
        determination about the geographical relationship between the two locations.'

      result: 'NO'
    2bdb1962-6a96-4e1e-bf06-049b0db144c3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, with ULM being "slightly to the north and
        east" relative to Louisiana Tech. Any directional difference, even if described
        as "slight," means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical analysis showing
        that ULM is "slightly to the north and east" relative to Louisiana Tech.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, noting that
        Monroe is "to the east of Ruston, and slightly to the north." The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that ULM is not south of Louisiana Tech. The answer
        is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    7b4c759f-4eae-4c8f-a52b-0e29ed0a8fa7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not needed when
        the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer to the question is YES" and provided clear reasoning for this comparative
        answer.

    9bd3a66d-33f5-4db2-bafc-36dc7faaae4d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        ULM is north of LA Tech, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states there is a directional difference ("north of"), so this is not a case
        of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether ULM is south of LA Tech, providing a direct comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are at the
        same latitude. Instead, it explicitly states that Monroe is "slightly north
        of Ruston," indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer about the geographical
        relationship between the two locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal/same
        - instead, it explicitly states that "the main building of the Academy of
        Art University...is slightly north of Golden Gate University's location."
        Since it indicates a directional difference (slightly north), even though
        small, this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly stating "the Academy of Art University is not located south of
        Golden Gate University."

    6df4eb89-0c99-4faa-95e0-6f952f00f0ee:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that Academy of
        Art University is "slightly north of Mission Street, where Golden Gate University
        is located." This indicates a difference in position, even if slight.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis that Academy of
        Art University is north (not south) of Golden Gate University.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "The primary administrative
        offices for the Academy of Art University are generally north of where Golden
        Gate University is situated." The NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (being north rather than south), not on equality of location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO. Academy
        of Art University is not located south of Golden Gate University" as its final
        answer. This is a direct comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly indicates a directional difference, stating that Pratt
        is "to the east and slightly south" of NYU Tandon. Even though "slightly south"
        is mentioned, any directional difference means the values are not equal.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that Pratt is northeast
        of NYU Tandon, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Pratt Institute is located south of NYU Tandon, explaining
        that Pratt is actually northeast of NYU Tandon.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Pratt being north
        of NYU Tandon, not because the locations are equal. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference ("Clinton Hill is generally north of Downtown
        Brooklyn"). Therefore, the NO is not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Pratt Institute is north of NYU Tandon (not south as
        asked in the comparison). This is a direct comparative answer.

        the same building (Bellamy Building) and explicitly uses this equality of
        location as the reason for its NO answer, stating "one is not south of the
        other" because they are "in the same building."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after determining that the two entities are
        in the same building.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    197b4c78-9e79-4661-bbb2-f60cad2ae551:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the locations were equal/same/identical - it simply
        stated it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", this NO is given because
        the model cannot determine the relative positions ("without precise coordinates
        or a detailed map, it is not straightforward to definitively say"). This is
        effectively stating that it cannot verify or determine the comparison, which
        meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    1f1b605b-2c27-45e4-b4ed-3bf2d745450c:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that both
        entities are located in the exact same building (Bellamy Building), and it
        explicitly states that "neither is located to the north or south of the other"
        because of this same location. The equality of location is the primary reason
        given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that neither entity is located north or south of the other
        since they are in the same building.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    275d0312-279c-4c59-9d3e-c856c3f3d509:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/identical in position. Rather, the NO is based on the
        explanation that they are part of the same building/structure, with one being
        contained within the other. The model doesn't state they are at the exact
        same coordinates or position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" and
        provides a clear explanation for this answer based on the entities being in
        the same building.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is explicitly based on the fact
        that both institutions are located in the same building ("they are in the
        same building"), making them exactly equal in location. This equality is the
        primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on its analysis that both institutions
        are in the same building.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    60ba92b7-526e-4392-b932-197162db2b15:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model indicates that both entities are "part of
        the same college and share facilities" and are "essentially in the same vicinity."
        This suggests they are in the same location, and this sameness of location
        appears to be the primary reason for the NO answer. The model does not indicate
        any directional difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, without qualifying it as inability to determine or verify. While it
        explains they share facilities, it still provides a clear NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model explains that the two entities are
        essentially in the same location since one is part of the other, it doesn't
        explicitly state they are equal/identical/the same as its primary reason for
        saying NO. Instead, it explains that the comparison "does not apply" because
        of their organizational relationship, making it a different type of reasoning
        than pure equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that the comparison doesn't apply in a traditional sense
        since one entity is part of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any discussion of equality or similarity in locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "a definitive YES or NO
        cannot be provided with certainty" and explains that it lacks sufficient information
        to make the comparison. This indicates it cannot determine the relative positions.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    99d54aac-5f71-4942-89ce-32a404639868:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it explains that
        they are "integrated within the same college structure" and that one is part
        of the other, making it incorrect to say one is entirely south of the other.
        The NO is based on their organizational relationship rather than having equal
        coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion, making this a clear NO answer. The model provides reasoning
        leading to this conclusion based on the organizational structure of the institutions.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    af26c22a-aae7-443b-b532-738c092f5deb:

      explanation_equal_values: The model indicates that both entities are in the
        same building and "do not have distinct separate south/north positions relative
        to each other." This equality of position is explicitly stated and is the
        primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative result (indicating one is not south
        of the other), not as a rejection of ability to determine or verify.

        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model didn't claim the
        locations were equal - it stated one location doesn't exist for comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the comparison since
        one of the universities (Henley-Putnam) doesn't have a physical location to
        compare. While it says "NO" at the end, this is a case where the model is

        - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but immediately qualifies
        it by stating it cannot determine the relative positions ("no clear north-south

        location is north of the other (indicating a difference in position), not
        because the locations are at the same latitude. The response explicitly states
        "Largo is situated to the west of Tampa, but slightly to the north as well."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it explicitly stated that La Salle Extension University was "further
        south" than Robert Morris University Illinois, indicating a difference in
        location. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Robert Morris University
        Illinois is not located south of La Salle Extension University" after determining
        that La Salle was further south based on their specific addresses.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, this automatically results in False for the equal values question,
        regardless of any discussion of locations in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (there is no clear evidence to
        definitively confirm...)" which indicates it cannot determine the relationship,
        rather than making a comparative conclusion. This is effectively stating it
        cannot verify or determine the relationship, making this an UNKNOWN response
        rather than a definitive NO comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that "401 S. State Street is slightly north
        of 417 S. Dearborn Street", indicating a difference in location. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Robert Morris University
        Illinois is not located south of La Salle Extension University" as its final

        Chicago and "in close proximity," it does not explicitly state they were at
        the exact same location or that equality is the reason for the NO answer.
        Instead, the NO is given because it cannot "definitively" determine the south
        positioning, suggesting uncertainty rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it notes uncertainty about exact locations. Since it provides a clear
        NO as a comparative result (not just inability to verify), this counts as
        a NO answer.

        is effectively stating it cannot determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN
        response rather than a definitive NO comparative result. The parenthetical
        explanation makes it clear this is a "cannot determine" response.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO, there is no clear indication..."
        However, this NO is actually expressing inability to determine the relationship,
        not a comparative result. The response consistently emphasizes that it cannot
        make the determination without specific building location information. This
        makes it a case of being unable to verify/determine the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions both institutions are on
        North Campus, it does not explicitly state they are at the same location or
        elevation. Rather, it indicates that without more specific data, it cannot
        verify one is south of the other. The NO answer is based on lack of evidence
        to support the southern position, not because of proven equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" and
        provides a clear comparative conclusion, even though the reasoning involves
        uncertainty about exact locations. Since it gives a definitive NO answer rather
        than stating it cannot determine the relationship, this counts as a NO final
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that Franklin College is "centrally located"
        while the School of Public and International Affairs is "in the north-central
        part of the campus" - implying different positions. The NO answer is based
        on this positional difference, not on equality of location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative directional result about the relative positions
        of the two institutions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that they "share the same location"
        and this equality of location is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
        The model does not indicate any directional difference between the locations,
        but rather explains they are exactly the same because Boyer College is part
        of Temple University.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion, making this a clear NO answer.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the reason given is that
        Boyer College is a part of Temple University, making the comparison invalid.
        This is more similar to rejecting the premise than stating equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Boyer College is part of Temple University.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it does not state that
        the locations are equal or identical. Instead, it explains that the comparison
        is not applicable because Boyer College is part of Temple University. Since
        equality is not given as the reason for the NO answer, this should be classified
        as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative result based on its analysis of the
        geographical relationship between the locations (even though its reasoning
        suggests the comparison may not be valid).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Boyer College is part of Temple University
        and therefore cannot be south of it - this is a logical relationship rather
        than an equality statement. The NO answer is based on organizational structure,
        not on equal coordinates or locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to the question
        is NO" as its final conclusion, providing a clear comparative answer based

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that Boyer
        College is part of Temple University and located within the same campus, not
        because they are at exactly the same location. While they are described as
        being at the same campus, the model doesn't explicitly state they are at the
        exact same coordinates or location as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion regarding whether Temple University is south of Boyer College.

        same campus, it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly the same location
        or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. Rather, the model argues
        that the university as a whole cannot be south of one of its constituent parts,
        which is a different logical argument than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is **NO**" as a comparative result, providing a clear negative answer
        to the location comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Cypress is "slightly more to the southwest compared to Anaheim").
        Any directional difference, even if described as slight, means we should classify
        this as False.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Trident University International was described as being "west and slightly
        north" of Anaheim, indicating a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying
        Cypress is "west and slightly north of Anaheim." The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Trident University International

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Cypress (where
        Trident is located) is "to the west of Anaheim" and "is not directly south
        of Anaheim." The NO answer is based on directional difference (west vs. south),
        not equality of position.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it wasn't because
        the locations are equal - rather, it explained that the College of Liberal
        Arts is not a separate entity that could be compared locationally with the
        university since it's a part of it. This is a different type of reasoning
        than saying the locations are the same.

        state they are at the exact same location/coordinates as the reason for the
        NO answer. Instead, the primary reasoning given is that they cannot be compared
        directionally because one is part of the other ("it is not a separate entity
        that can be located 'south' or in any other direction relative to the university
        itself").

    8dc9d147-bbdb-4d17-9c27-14823d1c8777:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Hartford was determined to be northwest of Cranston, indicating a directional
        difference. The model explicitly states "Hartford, CT is located to the northwest
        of Cranston, RI."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparative analysis
        showing Hartford is northwest of Cranston (not south).'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a directional difference - that the College of Education is north of the
        College of Arts and Sciences. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the buildings, stating that
        the College of Education (Porter Building) is north of the College of Arts
        and Sciences (Pray-Harrold Hall).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, let alone one based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer this question" and "can't provide a definitive YES or NO answer." It
        suggests checking a campus map to determine the answer. This indicates the
        model cannot make the comparison without additional information.

        Instead, it indicates that the College of Education is southeast of the College
        of Arts and Sciences, showing a directional difference. The NO answer appears
        to be based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        locations were at equal coordinates - it actually stated it couldn't determine
        Sonnencroft's specific location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO. Indiana State
        University is not located south of all locations in West Virginia." However,
        this is a rejection of the premise since it's comparing to "all locations"
        rather than the specific location (Sonnencroft) asked about in the question.
        The model also notes that Sonnencroft is "fictional or unspecified" and cannot
        determine its exact location. This makes it impossible to make the specific
        comparison requested.

    13ecfe80-9d00-4747-be84-58faee716289:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being at equal latitudes. Instead, it makes a directional comparison based
        on estimated positions, suggesting Indiana State University is likely north
        of where Sonnencroft would be in southern West Virginia. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Indiana State University
        is not located south of Sonnencroft, WV" as its final answer. While the model
        expresses some uncertainty about Sonnencroft's exact location, it still provides
        a definitive NO answer based on its reasoning about likely locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their relative positions
        due to missing information about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because "this determination cannot be accurately made" due to lack
        of information about one location. This is equivalent to saying it cannot
        determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive
        NO comparison.

    39d46767-d085-41da-8afb-e6eb69fea27d:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the response never suggests
        the locations are at equal latitudes - it discusses uncertainty about their
        relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at the end, it heavily
        qualifies this with assumptions and uncertainty, explicitly stating "we cannot
        definitively determine its latitude." The answer is presented as speculative
        ("assuming Sonnencroft is...") and acknowledges the lack of definitive information.
        This makes it clear the model cannot actually determine the relationship.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not

        "NO" as final, it wasn't based on equal values but rather on a hypothetical
        northern location of Sonnencroft.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot definitively answer due
        to lack of information about Sonnencroft's specific location. While it does
        say "NO" at the end, this is qualified with "if Sonnencroft is north of Terre
        Haute's latitude" - making it a conditional rather than definitive answer.

        ISU is south of it without further details."

        the final answer as NO, the response does not indicate equal values as the
        reason for the answer.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        it cannot determine Sonnencroft's specific location and can only make assumptions
        about "a general location in West Virginia." Since the model rejects the premise
        by questioning if Sonnencroft exists and indicates it cannot make a definitive
        comparison without specific coordinates, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        close to each other ("neighboring institutions"), it explicitly states that
        OBU is "slightly to the north" of HSU. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on the locations being equal/identical. Any directional difference,
        even if described as "slight," means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that OBU is not located south of HSU. The model provides
        a direct comparative result, explaining that OBU is actually slightly to the
        north of HSU.

        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with Ouachita Baptist University being north of Henderson State
        University. The NO is because the direction is opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis showing that Ouachita Baptist University is north (not south) of

        since the engineering college is part of/located within RIT. The model does
        not state that the locations are equal/identical/the same - it states one
        is part of the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Martin is
        "to the west" of Gallatin, indicating a difference in location. The NO answer
        was given because UTM is west but "not south" of Welch College.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether UTM is south of Welch College. The answer is definitive
        and comparative, not indicating uncertainty or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Martin is "further
        north than Gallatin" and uses this difference in position as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and explains
        that UT Martin is not located south of Welch College, providing a direct comparative
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - it explicitly states that Martin is northwest of Gallatin
        and Gallatin is southeast of Martin, indicating different positions. The NO
        is because one is northwest of the other, not because they're at the same
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" and
        clarifies that UT Martin is not south of Welch College. This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that UTM is "actually north of Welch College"
        and describes different locations (northwest vs central-north). The NO is
        because one location is north of the other, not because they're at the same
        latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether UTM is south of Welch College, providing a direct
        comparative result.

        positions - instead, it explicitly notes that "Martin is generally west and
        slightly north compared to Gallatin" indicating a difference in position,
        even if slight. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, the University
        of Tennessee at Martin is not located south of Welch College" as a clear comparative
        answer.

        is actually slightly north of Gallatin, TN (Welch College)" - indicating a
        difference in position, even if slight. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        the reason for NO is that the Weldon School is "located to the east and slightly
        south" rather than directly south of the College of Agriculture. The NO is
        based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result about the relative positions of the buildings.
        The NO is not a refusal to answer or inability to determine - it's a direct
        statement about the spatial relationship being different than what was asked.

        Instead, it explicitly notes a directional difference, stating that "Kenosha
        (Parkside) lies to the east and slightly north of Janesville (Rock County)."
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        model never suggests the locations are equal - it simply states it cannot
        determine their relative positions without more information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES/NO answer,
        instead explaining that it cannot determine the relationship without knowing
        what location Q6156423 refers to. It presents conditional outcomes ("If it
        turns out to be north... NO; if south... YES") but does not make a final determination.

        did not give a NO answer based on equal values - it simply stated it couldn't
        make the determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        state if USC Rossier School of Education is south of it" and suggests looking
        up additional information to make the comparison. This indicates the model
        cannot make the determination with available information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO without additional information" and explains it cannot determine

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (east vs south), not on equal values. It explicitly states that one location
        is east of the other, indicating a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal - it actually states that Bellevue is "slightly north or at a
        similar latitude to Seattle." Even the mention of "similar latitude" is presented
        as an alternative to being "slightly north," not as the primary reason for
        the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Bellevue being east of Seattle, not south), not because the locations are
        equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after explaining that Washington Technology University is not south of
        Antioch University Seattle. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly notes that Bellevue is "slightly to
        the north" of Seattle, indicating a difference in position. This difference,
        not equality, is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. While it mentions they are at "similar latitude," this implies
        there is some difference. The NO answer is based on the fact that Bellevue
        is east of Seattle, not that they are at exactly the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion about the southern location comparison.'

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" and clearly stated its comparative conclusion that Washington
        Technology University is south of Antioch University Seattle.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        one location was explicitly stated to be east (not south) of the other, indicating
        a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (east, not south)
        to support this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions that both locations are "around
        the same latitude," it specifically notes that Bellevue is "slightly to the
        east." The NO answer is primarily based on the directional difference (being
        east rather than south), not on the locations being at exactly the same latitude.
        Any mention of a difference, even if slight, means this should be classified
        as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Washington Technology University is not located south of Antioch
        University Seattle. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it notes they are "very close" but still indicates
        a difference by stating Bellevue is "slightly to the east" rather than directly
        stating they are at the same latitude. Since any difference, even if described
        as slight, means they're not exactly equal, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Washington Technology
        University is not located south of Antioch University Seattle" as its final
        comparative conclusion.

        based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer to the question

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Virginia
        Union University is north of the other institution, not because they are at
        the same location. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        ("Virginia Union University is situated to the north"), so this is not a case
        of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the institutions, making
        this a straightforward classification.

        locations were equal. The model explicitly states that VUU is "actually north
        of" URSPCS, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was given because
        the relationship is opposite to what was asked (north instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that VUU is not located south of URSPCS. The model provides
        a direct comparative result.

        the locations are equal/same - rather, the model explicitly states VUU is
        north-northwest of UR, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a directional comparison showing VUU is north-northwest
        of UR, not south of it.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that VUU is north of UR, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        was given because of this directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" and

        directional difference between the two locations. The NO answer was based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically addressing the comparative directional relationship between the

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Virginia Union University is located
        north of the University of Richmond. The NO is because the premise (VUU being
        south) is incorrect, not because the locations are the same.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions that one location is "approximately
        equal to or slightly north" of the other, it's not stating they are exactly
        equal. The "or slightly north" part indicates a potential difference, even

    b525e61a-fa73-48f0-831a-ef762d9fef40:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both locations are "roughly
        on the same latitude line" (40.7 degrees North) and this equality is presented
        as the primary reason for the NO answer. While it mentions potential slight
        variations based on exact coordinates, the core reasoning for the NO answer
        is that they share approximately the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Ohio State
        University, Lima Campus, OH is not located south of the School of Visual Arts,
        NY" as its final comparative answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Ohio State University, Lima Campus is south of the School of Visual
        Arts. The answer is clearly stated and directly addresses the comparison.
