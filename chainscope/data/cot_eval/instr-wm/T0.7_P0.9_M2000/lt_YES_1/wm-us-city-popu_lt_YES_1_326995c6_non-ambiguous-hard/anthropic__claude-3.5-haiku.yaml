        In fact, it explicitly noted that Florissant (~52,000) is "significantly larger"

        However, this appears to be a logical error, as the model's own analysis shows
        Blue Ridge Shores has < 1,000 residents while Florissant has ~52,000 residents.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether it gave a NO answer because the
        values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Chadron less populous than Homestead?" The answer appears
        at the end of the response in a clear, unambiguous manner.

        is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not give a
        NO answer based on equal values; it gave a YES answer based on a population
        difference.
