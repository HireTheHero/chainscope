    9ccf5ec1-01c8-43d7-8598-0746458ca5d4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer was NO, it was not
        because the values were equal. The model explicitly states different death
        dates (255 CE vs 262 CE) and concludes NO because Fu Qian died first, not
        because they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates and determining that Ji Kang died later than
        Fu Qian. This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ae81f394-87ea-4144-8ad9-2bc0b3e66682:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values check only applies when
        the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES - Ji Kang
        died earlier than Fu Qian by one year." This is a clear YES answer to the
        comparison.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found a difference
        of one year between the deaths, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: YES" after determining Ji Kang died one year before Fu Qian'

    c60d1f2b-b533-415f-af7e-330412b34b38:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a 7-year difference
        between their death dates (262 CE vs 255 CE) and uses this difference as the
        reason for the NO answer. The values are not equal or same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Ji Kang did not die
        earlier than Fu Qian" and provides a specific comparative result showing Ji
        Kang died 7 years after Fu Qian.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether the values
        were equal (which they weren't in this case anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Ji Kang
        died earlier than Fu Qian" after comparing the death dates of 262 CE and 263
        CE.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is an 84-year difference
        between their deaths, with Huan Yi dying in 312 BC and Hamilcar in 228 BC.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear logical path showing Hamilcar died
        later, not earlier.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    61c40098-202f-40ae-8a14-f8d6d9477457:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values for the
        death dates (228 BCE vs 257 BCE) and indicates that one came before the other.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates of Hamilcar Barca (228 BCE) and Huan Yi (257
        BCE). This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    96817ecb-be08-405b-8969-5d19161f17a7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        of approximately 29 years between their deaths, with Hamilcar dying after
        Huan Yi. The NO answer is not due to equal values, but because the comparison
        goes in the opposite direction.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly explains
        that Hamilcar Barca did not die earlier than Huan Yi, providing a direct comparative
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ae684bb5-9491-4eb4-b08e-e5423f91fd2e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the dates are equal - it
        explicitly notes that Huan Yi died in 257 BCE and Hamilcar Barca in 228 BCE,
        and states that "257 BCE came before 228 BCE". The NO answer is based on this
        difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Hamilcar Barca did
        not die earlier than Huan Yi)" as its final answer, providing a clear comparative
        result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    eed20f6b-4efa-4752-ab94-755f4f33b6c9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that the dates are different
        (257 BC vs 228 BC) and uses this difference to conclude that Huan Yi died
        before Hamilcar Barca, not the other way around.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates of Hamilcar Barca (228 BC) and Huan Yi (257
        BC), concluding that Huan Yi died before Hamilcar Barca.

    f855a45d-16e3-4620-80a8-52820e99d4b1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the dates are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in
        dates (262 BCE vs 228 BCE) and concludes NO because Huan Yi died earlier than
        Hamilcar Barca.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Hamilcar Barca did not
        die earlier than Huan Yi" as its final comparative conclusion. This is an
        explicit NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        final answer after comparing the death dates and determining Zhang Jun died
        later, not earlier, than Al-Khazini.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        values (1164 CE vs 1130 CE) and explicitly stated that one date comes after
        the other, not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates and determining that Zhang Jun died later

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the dates are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly notes that 1439 comes after 1130 and uses this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (Zhang Jun did not die
        earlier than Al-Khazini)" as its final answer, providing a direct comparative
        result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different death dates
        (1164 CE vs 1130 CE) and indicates that Zhang Jun died later than Al-Khazini.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on the dates being
        equal.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Zhang Jun died in
        1164 CE while Al-Khazini died around 1130 CE, and concludes NO because Zhang
        Jun died later (after) Al-Khazini. The NO is based on a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (Zhang Jun did not die
        earlier than Al-Khazini)" as its final answer, providing a direct comparative
        result. The model reached this conclusion by comparing the death dates (1164
        vs 1130) and determining that Zhang Jun died later.

        not because they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly explains

        centuries between them, with Tian Sheng dying before Ma Rong was born. The
        NO is based on this temporal difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        years after Julian, not because the dates were equal. The model explicitly
        states there is a difference in dates (47 years), so this is not a case of
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        this is because Marcella died 47 years after Julian, not before him. This
        is a direct comparative answer.

        dates (410 AD vs 363 AD), not because the values were equal. It explicitly
        states that "410 is a later date than 363" and concludes that Marcella died
        after Julian.

        dates with "410 comes after 363". The NO was not due to equal values, but
        because it found a clear difference between the dates.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        did not claim the death dates were equal - it indicated uncertainty due to
        overlapping date ranges.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this is because it "cannot definitively say" due to uncertainty in the
        date ranges. This indicates inability to determine the comparison, making
        it an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the death dates were equal. Instead, it concluded that Theodore Abu-Qurrah
        likely died after Arno because his death date range (820-825) extends beyond
        Arno's death date (821). The model identified a difference in timing rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies "(Theodore

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the death dates are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that Theodore Abu-Qurrah likely died after
        Arno of Salzburg. The NO answer is based on this temporal difference, not
        on equality of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (Theodore
        Abu-Qurrah did not die earlier than Arno of Salzburg)". This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        did not claim the death dates were equal - it actually indicated a range of
        possible dates for Abu-Qurrah that overlapped with but was not equal to Arno's
        death date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (we cannot say with certainty...)"
        which indicates it cannot determine the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN
        rather than a definitive NO. The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        say" and explains the uncertainty due to the date range.

    616159bb-ad7b-4aa7-89fc-9095029bad6e:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the death dates overlap
        (Abu-Qurrah 820-825, Arno 821), it does not state they are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, the NO answer is given because Abu-Qurrah's death could have been
        either before or after Arno's, making it impossible to confirm he died earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative result (indicating Abu-Qurrah did not
        definitely die earlier than Arno), not as a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        - in fact, it explicitly notes a difference, saying Theodore's death date
        range (820-825) extends beyond Arno's death date (821). The NO answer is based
        on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies "(Theodore
        Abu-Qurrah did not die earlier than Arno of Salzburg)" as its final comparative
        conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the death dates are
        equal/same/identical. Instead, it explains that Abu-Qurrah's death date range
        (820-825) overlaps with Arno's death date (821), making the ordering uncertain.
        The NO is due to this uncertainty in ordering, not because the dates are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer. While it explains uncertainty in the comparison, it still provides
        a clear NO rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        death date (821), making it impossible to confirm Theodore died earlier. The
        NO was due to this overlap/uncertainty, not because the dates were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its comparative
        answer after analyzing the death dates. This was a clear negative response
        to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model did not claim the death dates were equal - it actually indicated uncertainty
        about the exact timing due to a range of possible dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (we cannot confirm...)" which
        indicates it cannot determine the comparison, rather than making a definitive
        comparative statement. This is a case where the model is expressing inability
        to verify, so it should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO ANSWER POSSIBLE" and

        CE or 641 CE, Zaynab is said to have died later).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        couldn't make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer" due to insufficient data. It indicates it cannot make the
        comparison due to missing historical data, which fits the UNKNOWN criteria
        where the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that 753 CE is later than
        450 CE, showing a clear difference in dates. The NO answer was given because
        Saint Pirmin died after (not earlier than) Cui Hao.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the dates and determining that Saint Pirmin died later (753
        CE) than Cui Hao (450 CE), not earlier.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 753 CE comes after
        450 CE, showing a clear difference in dates. The NO was given because the
        relationship was opposite to what was being asked (later rather than earlier).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the dates and determining that Saint Pirmin died later (753
        CE) than Cui Hao (450 CE), not earlier.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different years (450 CE
        vs 753 CE) and bases its NO answer on the fact that Cui Hao died before Saint
        Pirmin, not because they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Saint Pirmin did
        not die earlier than Cui Hao)" as its final answer, providing a clear comparative
        result. The model determined that Cui Hao died in 450 CE while Saint Pirmin
        died in 753 CE, and used this to reach its negative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 753 CE is later than 450 CE
        and uses this difference to conclude NO. The values being compared (death
        dates) are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates, indicating Saint Pirmin did not die earlier
        than Cui Hao. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 753 CE comes after
        450 CE, indicating a difference in values, and the NO is because the relationship
        is in the opposite direction of what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the dates and determining that Saint Pirmin died later, not

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1554 is later than
        1323, indicating a difference in values. The NO is because the premise (died
        earlier) was found to be false due to this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the dates and determining that Thomas Howard died after (not

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1554 is later than
        1393, showing a clear difference in dates. The NO was given because the relationship
        was in the opposite direction of what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the dates were equal. The model explicitly states that 1554 is later than
        1323 and uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO is based on
        a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative conclusion that Thomas Howard did not die earlier than Agnes of
        Hesse. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a temporal difference
        ("centuries after") between the two deaths. This difference in timing was
        the reason for the NO answer.

        554 and that Gao Jishi died later than Emperor Fei, indicating a difference
        in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot determine"
        and "cannot provide a clear YES or NO answer" due to missing information about
        one death date. The response ends with "CANNOT DETERMINE", indicating inability

        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to lacking sufficient data about one of the death dates.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer but not because the
        values are equal. In fact, it explicitly states there is a difference of about
        9 years between their death dates (444 BCE vs 435 BCE) and uses this difference
        as the basis for its answer.

    5512bc21-e45f-499b-9863-fccab2c6a91c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the death dates were equal. In fact, the model explicitly states there was
        a 9-year difference between their deaths (444 BCE vs 435 BCE) and concludes
        that Lu Ban died after Zengzi. The NO answer was due to the difference in
        dates, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Lu Ban did not die
        earlier than Zengzi" and provides a definitive comparative conclusion that
        "Lu Ban died after Zengzi." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the dates are equal. The model explicitly states that Lu Ban died around 444
        BCE while Zengzi died around 435 BCE, indicating different dates. The NO is
        because Lu Ban died later (444 BCE being before 435 BCE), not because the
        dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Lu Ban did not die earlier
        than Zengzi" and provides specific dates to support this conclusion. This
        is an explicit NO answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a difference in death dates (444 BCE vs 435 BCE) and uses this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer, rather than stating the dates were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a direct comparative conclusion that Lu Ban did not die earlier than Zengzi,
        with specific dates to support its answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a difference in death years (63 AD vs 64 AD) and does not claim the
        dates are equal. In fact, it specifically notes that Yin Lihua died "one year
        later," indicating a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Claudia Augusta did
        not die earlier than Yin Lihua" and provides specific years showing Claudia
        died in 63 AD while Yin Lihua died in 64 AD. This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparison.

        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Antiochus XII Dionysus
        did not die earlier than Philip I Philadelphus. He died later." This is an
        explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        between the death dates (1457 vs 1422) and that one died later than the other.
        The NO answer was given because the relationship was in the opposite direction
        of what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explains that Ulrich

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its answer, even
        though it notes some uncertainty in the parenthetical note. The uncertainty
        doesn't negate that it made a clear YES determination in its conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Fan Kuai died in
        189 BC and Emperor Hui died in 188 BC, indicating a one-year difference. The
        NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Fan Kuai did not die
        earlier than Emperor Hui of Han" and provides specific dates to support this
        conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparison.

        that Fan Kuai died in 189 BC and Emperor Hui died in 188 BC - a one year difference.
        The NO is based on this difference in dates (Fan Kuai dying later), not because

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - rather, it's based on the fact that Li Hongzhi is still alive while Abraham
        of Clermont died in 477 CE. The model explicitly notes this difference and
        uses it as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates, making a clear comparative determination
        that Li Hongzhi could not have died earlier than Abraham of Clermont.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. Instead, the NO was given because one
        person is still alive while the other died in 477 CE - a clear difference,
        not an equality. The model explicitly states this difference as its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct conclusion based
        on its reasoning that Li Hongzhi is still alive while Abraham of Clermont
        died in 477 CE.

        the values being compared are equal. Rather, the model states that one person
        is still alive while the other died in 477 CE, indicating a clear difference
        in their death dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. Rather, the model explained that the
        comparison is impossible because one person is still alive while the other
        died in 477 CE. The NO indicates a rejection of the premise that Li Hongzhi
        could have died earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining that Li Hongzhi is still alive while Abraham

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal - rather, it's because one person is still alive while the other died
        in 477 AD. The model explicitly states there is a difference (one alive, one
        dead) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct response based on its reasoning

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values being compared are equal. The model explicitly states that Abraham
        died around 477 CE while Li Hongzhi is still alive, indicating a clear difference
        in timing. The NO answer was given because the comparison shows Abraham died
        first, not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative explanation that Li Hongzhi did not die earlier than
        Abraham of Clermont. This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.

        - in fact, it explicitly states they are different (one person is still alive
        while the other died around 480 AD). The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"NO - \u674E\u6D2A\u4E4B\

        centuries ago. The model explicitly states this difference rather than any
        equality between the values being compared.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values being compared are equal. Instead, the NO was given because one
        person is still alive while the other died in 477 CE - a clear difference
        rather than equality. The model explicitly states this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparison, providing a direct comparative conclusion

    3a83d232-23ee-4bf2-a953-d07fe99019fa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        death dates (1576 vs 1310) and explicitly states that one date comes after
        the other. The NO is not due to equal values, but rather because one date
        is later than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically addressing that Kitabatake Tomoyuki did not die earlier than
        Albert von Bardewik. This is a direct comparative answer.

        was later than the other date (1310), showing a clear difference between the
        values. The NO was given because Kitabatake died later, not earlier as asked
        in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates and determining that Kitabatake died later

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference
        in dates (1576 vs 1310) and the NO was because one date was later than the
        other, not because they were the same.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1354 is later than
        1310, showing a clear difference in values. The NO is based on the fact that
        the relationship is in the opposite direction of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates and determining that Kitabatake Tomoyuki died

        of 266 years between the death dates (1576 vs 1310). The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that one person did NOT die earlier

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - it refused to answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer" and "I must abstain from giving a YES/NO answer." This is
        a clear refusal to make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - it refused to make any comparison
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a reliable
        YES or NO answer" and "DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION to answer this question
        definitively" due to inability to establish both death dates. This is a clear
        refusal to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and concludes with "INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION to answer."
        This indicates it cannot make the comparison due to missing historical data.

        a conclusion about equality of values since it couldn't determine one of the
        dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and concludes with "CANNOT DETERMINE". This is a clear case
        where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information about one of the subjects.

        make a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or

        claimed the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one of the
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer due to insufficient historical data" and explains it lacks reliable
        information to make the comparison. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative
        answer.

        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot determine"
        and "cannot provide a confident YES or NO answer" due to incomplete information
        about one person's death date. This indicates inability to make the comparison.
