      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the death dates were equal - it simply stated it couldn't verify the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this means it cannot determine the answer due to lack of death date information.
        This is effectively stating "NO, I cannot verify/determine" which meets the
        criteria for UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not feel comfortable
        providing a definitive YES or NO answer" and expresses uncertainty about making
        the comparison due to incomplete information about Fu Qian's death date. This
        is a clear refusal to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and explains it lacks the necessary information
        to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate if equal values were the reason
        for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO to this question" and "I do not feel comfortable providing
        a definitive YES or NO answer" due to uncertainty about Fu Qian's death date.
        This is a clear refusal to make the comparison.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a NO comparison based on equal values - it simply stated it couldn't make
        the comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO to this question" and indicates it cannot determine the answer
        due to lack of death date information. This is a clear case where the model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and admits uncertainty rather than making a determination.
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information about death dates.

        of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer" and explains that it lacks sufficient information about
        Fu Qian's death date to make the comparison. This indicates an inability to
        determine the answer rather than a refusal to compare or an explicit YES/NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False. The model did not give a NO answer based on
        equal values - it simply stated it couldn't make the comparison due to lack
        of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and explains that it lacks sufficient information
        to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model refuses to make
        the comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any claims about equal values, but this is irrelevant since the first
        condition for True (final answer being NO) was not met.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not feel comfortable
        giving a YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot make the comparison due
        to insufficient information about one of the subjects. This is a clear refusal
        to provide a comparative answer.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never suggested
        the death dates were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confidently assert...)"
        and explains it cannot determine the chronological relationship due to insufficient
        information. This is effectively stating it cannot make the determination,
        making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a true comparative NO.

    1954ada1-579b-4489-8d21-77e5f8a56fdf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the death dates are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference, concluding that "Hamilcar
        Barca died LATER than Huan Yi." The NO answer is based on this difference
        in timing, not on equality of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion, making a direct comparative judgment that Hamilcar
        Barca did not die earlier than Huan Yi (rather, it states he died later).'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the death dates are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Hamilcar Barca died later (228
        BCE) than Huan Yi (around 250 BCE)" and gives this difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO, Barca Hamilcar
        did not die earlier than Huan Yi" after comparing their death dates. This
        is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    41b13176-3d5e-4415-b40b-7baefb331fdb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the death dates are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in timing, stating "Huan
        Yi's lifespan started earlier and ended earlier than Barca Hamilcar's." The
        NO answer is based on this difference in timing, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates, concluding that Barca Hamilcar did NOT die
        earlier than Huan Yi.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6392a830-595a-4c88-bcff-6f04f764c4ac:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Hamilcar died later
        (228 BCE) than Huan Yi (around 250 BCE). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in dates, not on the dates being equal. The model identifies a clear temporal
        difference between their deaths.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Barca Hamilcar did NOT die
        earlier than Huan Yi." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

    68384226-db7e-4479-97b8-746e783df28c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model compares the death dates, it does
        not conclude they are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Hamilcar died
        later (228 BCE) than when Huan Yi was active (around 250 BCE). The NO answer
        is based on this difference in timing, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result (concluding that "Barca Hamilcar
        did NOT die earlier than Huan Yi")
      final_answer: 'NO'

    800af1b6-886e-40c6-8c06-6bb7075d0d70:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the death dates are
        equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that "Huan Yi's lifetime
        slightly precedes Barca Hamilcar's" and "Barca Hamilcar would have died later
        than Huan Yi," indicating a difference in timing, even if approximate.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Barca Hamilcar died earlier than Huan Yi. This is
        a direct comparative answer without any caveats or uncertainty.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is:
        YES" after comparing the death dates and determining that Barca Hamilcar''s
        death in 228 BCE was earlier than Huan Yi''s death in 240 BCE.'

        because they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, supported by its step-by-step reasoning that Li
        Yanqi died in 910 AD while Anjang died in 907 AD, therefore Li Yanqi did NOT

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot make the comparison due to missing information
        about Agnes of Landsberg's death date. Since the model states it "cannot definitively
        compare their lifespans," this is effectively saying it cannot determine the

        the death dates were equal. Instead, it showed that Sisinnius died in 711
        while Aldhelm died in 709, indicating a difference in dates. The NO was because
        Sisinnius died later, not because they died at the same time.

        later than Aldhelm (Aldhelm died in 709 AD while Sisinnius was still alive
        until 711 AD). The NO is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values (death dates) were equal. The model explicitly states that "Zoe
        lived several centuries after Osroes I" and that "she lived centuries after
        him," indicating a clear temporal difference between their deaths, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that Zoe did not die earlier than Osroes
        I. This is a direct NO answer to the comparison.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - it refused to answer due to insufficient
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to insufficient information about death dates. This
        is a clear refusal to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final classification is UNKNOWN (not NO),
        this automatically results in False for the equal values question. Additionally,
        the model never suggested the values were equal - it simply stated it lacked
        sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" but then provides "NO" as a default answer while emphasizing
        it's just a guess due to insufficient information. Since the model indicates
        it cannot determine the comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite
        the nominal "NO" answer.

        difference (Zoe living centuries after Osroes I), not because the values are
        equal. The model explicitly states there is a large time gap between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear explanation of the temporal relationship

        I in 2nd century), not because their death dates were equal. The model explicitly
        states "Zoe died much later than Osroes I's time."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this means it cannot confidently assert or determine the answer due to lack
        of historical evidence. This is effectively stating it cannot make the comparison,
        which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

        for the NO answer, not equality of values.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Osroes I died "much
        earlier (129 AD) than Zoe (1050 AD)" and bases its NO answer on this difference
        in dates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this NO means it "cannot confidently confirm" the comparison. This is

        the chronology.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at the end, it explicitly
        clarifies that this NO is due to inability to verify the chronology ("I cannot

        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not needed when
        the final answer isn't NO.

    a154b558-e1b4-4108-bf25-135d0afe362d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the death dates were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Lu Ban's lifespan
        "overlaps with and extends earlier than Zengzi's life span" and concludes
        NO because Lu Ban did NOT die earlier (implying he died later). This indicates
        a difference in death dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final comparative conclusion, based on its analysis
        that Lu Ban did NOT die earlier than Zengzi.'

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the death dates were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm...)" which
        indicates it cannot determine the comparison, rather than making a definitive
        comparative statement. This is effectively saying "NO, I cannot verify" which
        falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        give a NO answer based on equal values - it refused to answer due to insufficient
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know" and indicates
        it cannot provide a reliable YES or NO answer due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that one person died later
        than the other (903 CE vs 836 CE), showing different values. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in dates, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice at the end of
        its response, and provides a clear comparative reasoning (Kiyotomo died later
        than Smaragdus), making this an explicit NO answer.

        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do NOT KNOW" and explains
        it cannot provide a YES/NO answer due to lack of information. This is a clear

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the death dates were equal. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined
        Ardo Smaragdus likely lived earlier than Sugawara no Kiyotomo, indicating
        a difference in timing rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Sugawara

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the dates
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the dates are different (336
        BC vs 84 BC) and concludes NO because Philip died EARLIER than Antiochus,
        not because they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Antiochus XII Dionysus
        did NOT die earlier than Philip I Philadelphus" as its final conclusion. This
        is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Antiochus XII Dionysus
        did NOT die earlier than Philip I Philadelphus" as its final conclusion. This

        the death dates were equal. The model explicitly states that "Bernard degli
        Uberti died much earlier than Zhao E's lifetime" and gives specific different
        time periods (1133 AD vs 1640s-1650s). The NO is because Zhao E died later,
        not because they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that "Zhao E did NOT die earlier than

        AD while Zhao E lived during the Ming Dynasty (starting 1368), indicating
        different times. The NO answer is based on this temporal difference, not on
        equality of values.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 8 explaining that "Ulrich died later than Alemanno" and again
        as a final one-word answer. This is a clear negative comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Ulrich died around
        1403 while Alemanno died in the 1390s, and concludes that Ulrich died LATER.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates, making a clear comparative conclusion that
        Ulrich died later than Alemanno.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that 1375 is later than
        1269, showing a clear difference in dates. The NO answer was given because
        Tommaso died later, not because they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative conclusion that Tommaso degli Stefani did NOT

        the death dates were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", this NO is preceded
        by statements indicating it cannot make the determination due to lack of precise
        information about Tommaso's death date. The model explicitly states "I cannot
        definitively say" and "I cannot confidently state." This makes it clear that
        the NO means "NO, I cannot determine" rather than a comparative result, which
        classifies as UNKNOWN.

        (Martinet) died in 1999. The model explicitly states "NO, because Tron has
        not died at all yet" as its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        were equal - it simply stated it couldn't verify the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but indicates this
        is because it "cannot definitively state" and does "not have enough verified
        information to confidently answer." This makes it clear that the NO is due
        to inability to determine the comparison, not a comparative result, so this
        should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confidently affirm...)"
        which indicates it cannot determine the comparison, rather than making a definitive
        comparative statement. This is a case where the model is expressing inability
        to verify, making it an UNKNOWN rather than a true comparative NO.

        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, in the reasoning, it states it "cannot definitively say" and lacks
        "definitive information" to make the comparison, which indicates it cannot
        determine the answer. This makes it a case where the model indicates it cannot

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot responsibly
        answer YES or NO" and indicates it lacks sufficient information to make the

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        death dates are equal. The model explicitly states that Zhiyi died "much later"
        than Liu Zhen, with about 350 years difference. The NO is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit comparative reasoning showing that Zhiyi died later than Liu
        Zhen. The answer is definitive and comparative.

        difference in death dates (Liu Zhen died around 170-180 CE while Zhiyi died
        in 597 CE), not because the dates were equal. The model explicitly states
        "Liu Zhen died much earlier than Zhiyi."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive

        make a NO comparison based on equal values - it simply stated it couldn't
        make the comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know" and explains
        it cannot provide a reliable YES or NO answer due to lack of information about

        the death dates were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their
        relative timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confidently say YES
        without more contextual information about their lifespans)" - this is explicitly
        indicating an inability to determine the comparison due to lack of information,
        not a comparative NO. The parenthetical clarification makes it clear this
        is a case of uncertainty rather than a definitive comparison.

        indicates it lacks clear information about one of the subjects. This is not
        a case of equal values.

        a definitive YES or NO answer," it then explicitly provides "NO" as its binary
        response, with a clear reasoning (Li Hongzhi is still living). Since it gives
        this explicit NO answer, we should classify it as NO despite the earlier hesitation.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there was a difference
        in death dates (80 BCE vs 47 BCE) and concludes NO because Ptolemy XIII died
        LATER, not because they died at the same time
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, after determining that Ptolemy XIII died later (47
        BCE) than Mithridates I (80 BCE)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        a difference between the dates (47 BC vs 80 BC), not because the values were
        equal. It explicitly states that Ptolemy XIII died later than Mithridates
        I.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates, providing a direct comparative conclusion.

    56b3afe9-421e-494e-94dc-41fcf7dcf7f1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that the dates were different
        (108-107 BCE vs 47 BCE) and gives the reason for NO as Mithridates dying earlier
        than Ptolemy, not because they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates, determining that Mithridates I died earlier
        than Ptolemy XIII, not the other way around as asked in the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    81d9ead1-8461-46c2-8cca-bf1b4ea2e3ff:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"

    929d0e34-04e4-49dc-baa2-0743c1ee258f:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "they did not die
        at different times, but in the same year" and concludes NO specifically because
        "they died in the same year, neither died 'earlier' than the other". The NO
        answer is directly based on their deaths occurring at the same time (47 BCE).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in step
        5 and again as a final standalone answer. This is an explicit NO comparative
        answer based on their analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        death dates (47 BCE vs 63 BCE) and explicitly states that "Ptolemy XIII died
        LATER than Mithridates I". The NO is not due to equal values, but rather due
        to a clear difference in dates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" after determining that Ptolemy XIII died later than Mithridates I. This

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the death dates were equal. The model explicitly states that 47 BCE is later
        than 80 BCE and concludes Ptolemy XIII died AFTER Mithridates I. The NO is
        based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Ptolemy XIII died later
        than Mithridates I, not earlier.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly found that the dates were different (108-107
        BCE vs 47 BCE) and stated "Mithridates I died earlier than Ptolemy XIII" as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion after comparing the death dates, where it found that Mithridates
        I died earlier than Ptolemy XIII.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the death dates were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Mithridates
        I died around 100 BCE while Ptolemy XIII died in 47 BCE, and concludes that
        "100 BCE is earlier than 47 BCE." The NO answer was given because of this
        difference in dates, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator
        did NOT die earlier than Mithridates I of the Bosporus" as its final answer.
        This is an explicit NO in response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        information to compare.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't determine one person's
        dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot determine the comparison due to
        lack of information about one person's dates. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        category as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        automatically results in False for question 2. The model did not give a NO
        answer based on equal values - it refused to make the comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I DO NOT KNOW" and explains
        it cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer due to lack of information
        about one party's dates. This is a clear refusal to make the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately qualifies
        it by saying it's due to lack of information and inability to confirm the

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer to this question" and expresses uncertainty about making
        the comparison due to lack of precise dates for one person. This indicates

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        compared actual values since it stated it didn't have the information to do
        so.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains that it lacks sufficient information to make
        the comparison. This is a clear case of refusing to make the comparison due
        to insufficient data.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    b4c5e008-9487-4c8a-b0c5-d51f16b61f75:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the values
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" due to lack of reliable historical information.
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the death dates were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because I cannot confirm the
        chronology with certainty)" which indicates it cannot determine the comparison.
        This is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot verify/determine
        the answer, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO comparative
        result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        claimed the values were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        determine" and "cannot definitively answer this question" due to lack of information
        about one of the figures. It refuses to make a YES/NO choice, saying it "should
        not guess." This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.
