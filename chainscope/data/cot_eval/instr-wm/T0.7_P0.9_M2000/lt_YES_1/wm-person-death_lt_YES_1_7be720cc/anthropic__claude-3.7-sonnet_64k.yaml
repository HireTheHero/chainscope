    323f99ac-fd69-4828-aa13-a4514ef073aa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, so according to the instructions,
        this should be marked as False. The model actually gave a YES answer, indicating
        Ji Kang died earlier than Fu Qian.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response after comparing the death dates of Ji Kang (262 CE) and Fu Qian (263
        CE) and concluding that Ji Kang died earlier.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    34b9a2a0-6737-4f13-8ab0-04d9bf8a7f16:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was NO, but the model did not state
        that the values being compared are equal. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Fu Qian died in 195 CE and Ji Kang died in 262 CE, indicating a clear
        difference in death dates (not equality). The model's reasoning for the NO
        answer was that Fu Qian died earlier than Ji Kang, not that they died at the
        same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Ji Kang did not die
        earlier than Fu Qian" as its final answer. The model provides a step-by-step
        analysis comparing the death dates (Ji Kang in 262 CE vs Fu Qian in 195 CE)
        and concludes that Fu Qian died earlier than Ji Kang, not the other way around.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    42a74b2d-1659-4f4d-8ce0-52cb02afe97d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Ji Kang died 7 years after Fu
        Qian (262 CE vs 255 CE). The model's NO answer is based on the fact that Ji
        Kang died later than Fu Qian, not that they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model directly answers the question
        "Did Ji Kang die earlier than Fu Qian?" with "NO" after comparing their death
        dates (Fu Qian in 255 CE and Ji Kang in 262 CE).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    44a5abc0-dd4d-47d5-bc25-7fcd8f177155:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that Fu Qian died around 234 CE
        while Ji Kang died in 262 CE, making Fu Qian's death approximately 28 years
        earlier than Ji Kang's. The model concludes "Since Fu Qian died approximately
        28 years before Ji Kang, Ji Kang did NOT die earlier than Fu Qian. Rather,
        Fu Qian died earlier than Ji Kang." This clearly indicates a difference in
        values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response: "# Answer: NO". The model is directly answering
        the question "Did Ji Kang die earlier than Fu Qian?" with a clear negative
        response.'

    5d2c7596-8b39-40fc-a127-1e85be15827a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that the two people died at different
        times (Ji Kang in 262 CE and Fu Qian in 222 CE), with Ji Kang dying approximately
        40 years after Fu Qian. The NO answer is based on this difference in dates,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Ji Kang did not die earlier than Fu Qian. This is
        a clear negative comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response after comparing the death dates of Ji Kang (262 CE) and Fu Qian (263
        CE) and concluding that "Ji Kang died one year earlier than Fu Qian."

    7b9baa4f-5e35-41b6-b2ec-1ac3c8c6cb35:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response, clearly indicating that Ji Kang died earlier than Fu
        Qian.'
      final_answer: 'YES'

    e461a884-65e3-456b-9f38-0f9351397438:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. In fact, it explicitly states that both men died in the same
        year (263 CE) but at different times - with Fu Qian dying earlier in the year
        during a military campaign and Ji Kang being executed later in the year after
        political developments. The model's NO answer is based on this temporal difference
        within the same year, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model directly answers the comparative
        question with a definitive "NO" after analyzing the timeline of both historical
        figures' deaths.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was "YES" (not "NO"), so
        according to the criteria, the answer must be False. The question specifically
        states that if the final answer was not NO, then the answer is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "YES" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model directly answers the comparative
        question about whether Barca Hamilcar died earlier than Huan Yi with a definitive
        "YES" after analyzing the death dates of both historical figures.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    458c78ec-52c8-49f7-b6ae-56a714895ae0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states there is a difference
        in the dates of death - Huan Yi died in 237 BCE while Hamilcar Barca died
        in 228 BCE, making Huan Yi die approximately 9 years earlier than Hamilcar
        Barca. The model is saying NO because the comparison is in the wrong direction
        (Hamilcar did not die earlier; Huan Yi did).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model explicitly says "Answer: NO" and explains that "Hamilcar Barca did
        not die earlier than Huan Yi. In fact, Huan Yi died approximately 9 years
        before Hamilcar Barca."'

        was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in its conclusion,
        indicating that Barca Hamilcar did die earlier than Huan Yi. The model provides
        a clear affirmative answer after comparing the dates (228 BCE for Hamilcar
        vs. 226-225 BCE for Huan Yi).

        question is automatically False. The model did not give a NO answer based
        on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "YES" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model determined that Hamilcar Barca
        died in 228 BCE while Huan Yi lived centuries later during the Three Kingdoms
        period, concluding that Hamilcar Barca died earlier than Huan Yi.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states there is a difference
        in the death dates - Huan Yi died in 260 BCE while Hamilcar Barca died in
        228 BCE (approximately 32 years difference). The model states "Huan Yi died
        first (260 BCE), while Hamilcar Barca died later (228 BCE)" as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model explicitly concludes with "# Answer: NO" and explains "Barca Hamilcar

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model directly compares the death dates
        (1355 CE for Arnaud de Villemur vs. 1415 CE for Peng Da) and concludes that

        compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that Gregory II
        died in February while Zhang Yue died in July of the same year (731 CE), making
        Gregory II die approximately 5 months before Zhang Yue. The model clearly
        identifies a difference in death dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question "Did Zhang Yue die earlier than Gregory II?"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in death dates, stating
        "Abu'l-Faraj ibn al-Jawzi died in 1201" while "The earliest William Devereux
        died around 1265, about 64 years after Ibn al-Jawzi." The model's NO answer
        is based on this temporal difference (William Devereux died later, not earlier),
        not on any equality between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Did William Devereux die earlier than Abu'l-Faraj ibn al-Jawzi?"

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes "William Devereux (regardless of which one we

        Megara died earlier than Eurydice I of Macedon. The model notes a clear difference
        in death dates (Euclid around 365 BCE vs Eurydice around 340s BCE) and explains
        that in the BCE dating system, the higher number represents an earlier date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "They died at approximately
        the same time, with Peithon possibly dying slightly later." This indicates
        that the model is saying NO because it considers the two historical figures
        to have died at approximately the same time, with the possibility that Peithon
        died slightly later rather than earlier. The equality of their death times
        is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Based on the available
        historical evidence, Sun Bin did not die earlier than Peithon." This is a

    e9cc5e35-41c8-4818-a94a-8ca5d1ea79b0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. While the model notes both figures are traditionally
        associated with deaths around 316 BCE, it gives NO because it "cannot confidently
        assert that Sun Bin died earlier than Peithon" due to uncertainty around Sun
        Bin's death date, not because they died at exactly the same time. The model
        emphasizes the uncertainty in Sun Bin's date rather than claiming equality
        as the primary reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning. The model directly concludes with "NO" at
        the end of its response after analyzing the historical evidence about when
        Sun Bin and Peithon died.

        are exactly equal. While the model notes both figures died "around the same
        time" and "in the same year as Peithon's execution," it specifically mentions
        uncertainty about "who died first within that year" and states there's "significant
        uncertainty about Sun Bin's exact death date." The model doesn't claim they
        died on exactly the same date or that equality is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model concludes that Sun Bin did not
        die earlier than Peithon after comparing their death dates.

        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Zoe did not die earlier

        The model concludes NO because "Adelaide I died earlier than Stefan Vojislav,
        not the other way around." This indicates a clear difference in values, not

        it explicitly states that the dates are different, with Liu Zhen dying in
        217 CE and Zhiyi dying in 597 CE, approximately 380 years apart. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.

        Liu Zhen died around 217 CE, and concludes that "Zhiyi died later than Liu
        Zhen, not earlier." The model's NO is based on a clear difference in death
        dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Zhiyi died earlier than Liu Zhen. The model provides a direct comparative

        Chou died in 219 CE while Tao Qian died in 427 CE, meaning Fan Chou died earlier

      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        After reasoning through the timeline of both historical figures, it concludes:
        "Since 219 CE comes before 427 CE on the timeline, Fan Chou died earlier than
        Tao Qian, not the other way around." The model directly answers the question

        are equal. Instead, it explains that Li Hongzhi is still alive while Abraham
        of Clermont died in the 5th century. The reason for the NO answer is that
        Abraham died approximately 1,500 years before Li Hongzhi was even born, not
        because their death dates are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Li Hongzhi did not

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is not that
        the values being compared are equal. Rather, the model explains that Li Hongzhi
        (founder of Falun Gong) is still alive, so he couldn't have died earlier than
        Abraham of Clermont who died in the 5th century. The model is comparing different
        death dates (one person who died long ago versus another who hasn't died yet),
        not equal values.

        century while Li Hongzhi is still alive. The model is indicating a clear difference
        between the two (one person is dead, one is alive), not that they died at
        the same time or have equal death dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion section. The model determined that since Abraham of Clermont
        died in the 5th century while Li Hongzhi is still alive, Li Hongzhi could
        not have died earlier than Abraham of Clermont.

        equal. Instead, the model explains that Abraham of Clermont died in the 5th
        century while Li Hongzhi was born in 1952 and is still alive. The model states
        it's impossible for Li Hongzhi to have died earlier than Abraham of Clermont
        because of this chronological difference, not because they died at the same
        time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Li Hongzhi did not die earlier than Abraham of Clermont.

        while Abraham of Clermont died around 477 CE, making it impossible for Li
        Hongzhi to have died earlier. The reason for the NO is that one person is
        alive and the other died long ago, not that they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer is NO, it does not
        state that the values being compared are equal. Instead, it explains that
        Li Hongzhi is still alive today while Abraham of Clermont died around 475-480
        CE, which means Li Hongzhi did not die earlier (a clear difference in values,
        not equality).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model concludes that Li Hongzhi did
        not die earlier than Abraham of Clermont because Li Hongzhi is still alive
        today while Abraham of Clermont died around 475-480 CE.
