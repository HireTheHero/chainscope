      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO, so according
        to the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, Ji Kang died earlier
        than Fu Qian" as its final answer after comparing the dates of death (262
        CE for Ji Kang and 263 CE for Fu Qian).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did note they died in the same year, but it didn't claim they died
        at exactly the same time - rather it stated it couldn't determine the sequence
        within that year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its final conclusion, but it's actually saying "NO, I cannot confirm" which
        indicates it cannot determine the answer rather than making a definitive comparative
        judgment. The model explains that both individuals died in the same year (263
        CE) but that it lacks the precise information about months or days to determine
        who died earlier.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that Huan Yi died around 237 BCE while Hamilcar
        Barca died around 228 BCE, with Huan Yi dying approximately 9 years before
        Hamilcar Barca. The model's NO answer is based on the fact that the dates
        are different, with Huan Yi dying earlier, not Hamilcar Barca.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Barca Hamilcar did
        not die earlier than Huan Yi; it was the other way around." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly noted a difference in
        death dates (Hamilcar Barca died in 228 BC while Huan Yi died around 237 BC)
        and used this difference as the basis for its NO answer. The model determined
        that 237 BC came before 228 BC.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question.

        that the dates were different (1821 vs 1803) and that the relationship was
        the opposite of what was being asked (William died later, not earlier than
        Adam).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that William A. Burwell
        died in 1821 while Adam Storck died in 1803, and concluded that William A.

        William A. Burwell died in 1821, with 1816 being earlier than 1821. The NO
        answer is based on the fact that the comparison is in the wrong direction

        not because the dates are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: 'The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. In fact, it explicitly stated that the values are different:
        "Zichan died around 522 BCE, while Anaxandridas II died around 520 BCE." The
        model concluded that Zichan died earlier because 522 BCE came before 520 BCE.
        The NO answer indicates a rejection of the comparison as stated in the original
        question (which we don''t see, but was likely asking if Anaxandridas II died
        before Zichan).'
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model determined that Zichan died earlier

        In fact, it explicitly states that "Zichan died around 522 BCE" and "Anaxandridas
        II died around 520 BCE" and concludes that "Zichan died approximately 2 years
        earlier than Anaxandridas II." The model is giving a NO answer because it
        believes the comparison is in the wrong direction (it thinks Anaxandridas
        II died later than Zichan, not that they died at the same time).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Zichan did not die
        earlier than Anaxandridas II; rather, Anaxandridas II died later than Zichan."

        BCE) and concludes that Zichan died earlier than Anaxandridas II. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather expressed
        inability to make the comparison due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot definitively
        state that Ma Rong died earlier than Tian Sheng based on the historical information
        available to me." This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine"
        because it lacks sufficient information about Tian Sheng's death date to make
        the comparison. The model is not making a comparative determination but rather
        stating its inability to answer the question definitively.

        he lived several centuries before Ma Rong." The model is indicating a clear
        difference in timing, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Ma Rong did not
        die earlier than Tian Sheng." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values (death dates)
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly stated that Ma Rong died in 166 CE and Tian
        Sheng died around 190 CE, and that "166 CE comes before 190 CE." The model's
        reasoning indicates a clear difference in dates, not equality. The "NO" answer
        contradicts the model's own reasoning, but it did not give equality as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" which directly contradicts
        its own reasoning. The model concluded "Ma Rong died earlier than Tian Sheng"
        in its analysis, but then gave "NO" as its final answer. This creates a contradiction,

        contradicts itself by saying "Ma Rong appears to have died before Tian Sheng."
        This makes the final answer unclear and inconsistent. Since there is no clear

        due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer to whether Ma Rong died earlier than Tian Sheng" due to limited
        information about Tian Sheng's death date. The model acknowledges it cannot

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Li Yanshi died in 734 CE while Anjang died in 531 CE, meaning Li Yanshi
        died later, not earlier than Anjang. The model explicitly states the values
        are different (not equal), with Li Yanshi's death coming after Anjang's.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Li Yanshi died earlier than Anjang. The model clearly
        concludes "Therefore, Li Yanshi died later than Anjang, not earlier. NO"

        Li Yanshi died in 756 CE, with approximately 225 years difference between
        them. The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model clearly states \"NO, \u674E\u5EF6\u5BD4\

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (death dates)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that Li Yanshi died around 757-759
        CE while Anjang died in 757 CE, and concludes that Li Yanshi likely did not
        die earlier than Anjang. The model is noting a difference in timing (Anjang
        died first), not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Li Yanshi likely
        did not die earlier than Anjang)" as its final answer. This is a clear NO
        response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (death dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Li Yanshi died
        in 734 CE while Anjang died in 531 CE, with Li Yanshi dying approximately
        203 years AFTER Anjang. The NO answer is based on the fact that Li Yanshi
        died later, not earlier, than Anjang.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Li Yanshi died earlier than Anjang. The model clearly
        concludes that Li Yanshi did NOT die earlier than Anjang, but rather died
        approximately 203 years AFTER Anjang.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the dates are different (Li
        Yanshi died in 674 CE while Anjang died in 531 CE) and concludes that "Li
        Yanshi died later than Anjang, not earlier." The NO answer is based on this
        difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Li Yanshi died earlier than Anjang. The model clearly

        question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values; it actually gave a YES answer based
        on Li Yanshi dying earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer. The model concluded
        that since Li Yanshi died in 746 CE and Anjang died in 1031 CE, and 746 CE
        comes before 1031 CE, Li Yanshi died earlier than Anjang.

        question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - in fact, it determined the values
        were different (1932 vs 1933) and corrected its initial NO to a YES.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer, recognizing that Wilhelm
        Ostwald (died 1932) did die earlier than Adolf Loos (died 1933).

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that Wilhelm
        Ostwald died in April 1932 and Adolf Loos died in August 1933, and concludes
        that "Wilhelm Ostwald died earlier than Adolf Loos." The NO answer appears
        to be in response to a question about whether Adolf Loos died earlier than
        Wilhelm Ostwald (though the original question isn't provided). The model is
        noting a difference in dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear and explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that Wilhelm
        Ostwald died on April 4, 1932, while Adolf Loos died on August 23, 1933. The
        model concludes that "Since 1932 comes before 1933, Wilhelm Ostwald died earlier
        than Adolf Loos." This indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question
        after working through the dates of death for both individuals.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that the death dates were different (1932 vs 1933). The model explicitly states
        "Wilhelm Ostwald died earlier than Adolf Loos" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates of Wilhelm Ostwald and Adolf Loos. The model
        determined that Wilhelm Ostwald died in 1932 while Adolf Loos died in 1933,

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Wilhelm Ostwald died in 1932 and Adolf Loos died in 1933, indicating
        a difference in death dates. The model explicitly states "Since 1932 comes
        before 1933, Wilhelm Ostwald died earlier than Adolf Loos." This shows the
        model identified a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear NO response to the question of whether Adolf Loos died earlier
        than Wilhelm Ostwald. The model determined that Wilhelm Ostwald died in 1932
        while Adolf Loos died in 1933, and concluded that Wilhelm Ostwald died earlier.

      explanation_final_answer: 'The model initially made an error by stating "NO,
        Wilhelm Ostwald did not die earlier than Adolf Loos," but then immediately

        likely died after Arno of Salzburg, placing Theodore's death closer to 825
        CE while Arno died in 821 CE. The model is noting a difference in the timing
        of their deaths as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final answer,
        specifically saying "NO (Theodore Abu-Qurrah most likely did not die earlier

        that Theodore Abu-Qurrah died in approximately 823 CE while Arno of Salzburg
        died on January 24, 821 CE. The model explicitly states that "823 CE comes
        after 821 CE" and therefore "Theodore Abu-Qurrah died later than Arno of Salzburg,
        not earlier." The model is noting a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Theodore Abu-Qurrah died earlier than Arno of Salzburg.
        The model explicitly concludes "Theodore Abu-Qurrah died later than Arno of
        Salzburg, not earlier" and ends with "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a definitive NO answer based on equal values, but rather
        expressed uncertainty about the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - Based on the historical
        records, I cannot confirm that Theodore Abu-Qurrah died earlier than Arno
        of Salzburg." This is a case where the model is saying it cannot determine
        the answer, rather than making a definitive comparative judgment. The model
        states "I cannot definitively say" and "I cannot confirm" which indicates
        uncertainty rather than a clear comparative result.

        CE while Arno of Salzburg died on January 24, 821 CE. The model concludes
        that Arno likely died first, which means the dates are different, not the
        same. The NO answer is based on this difference in timing, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Theodore Abu-Qurrah

        is uncertain (around 820-825 CE) while Arno of Salzburg died on January 24,
        821 CE. The model says NO because of this uncertainty, not because the dates
        are equal. The model specifically notes that Theodore "may have died before
        Arno if he died in 820, but he may have died after Arno if he died in 821-825"
        and concludes it "cannot definitively say he died earlier."

        in 821, while Theodore likely died around the same time or a few years later
        (up to 825)." This suggests a potential difference in death dates, with Theodore
        possibly dying later than Arno. The model is not claiming equality as the
        reason for its NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that Theodore died around 820-825
        CE while Arno died specifically on January 24, 821 CE. The model's reasoning
        is that "Arno's death date falls within the range of Theodore's possible death
        years" and "Theodore may have died as late as 825 CE (after Arno's 821 death),"
        suggesting Theodore likely died later than Arno. This indicates a difference

        is a range (820-825 CE) while Arno of Salzburg died specifically on January
        24, 821 CE. The model concludes that Theodore likely died after Arno, not
        at the same time. The NO answer is based on a temporal difference (after vs.
        before), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Theodore Abu-Qurrah

        William Marshal died earlier than Agnes of Landsberg." However, the model
        then corrected itself and explicitly stated "YES, William Marshal did die

        Marshal died in 1219 and Agnes of Landsberg died in 1266, and it even calculates
        that William Marshal died 47 years earlier. The model's NO answer contradicts
        its own analysis, but it clearly did not claim the death dates were equal.

        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question
        about whether William Marshal died earlier than Agnes of Landsberg. The model
        actually determined that William Marshal did die earlier (in 1219 vs. 1266),

        at approximately the same time or slightly after Zaynab." This suggests Bilal
        may have died later than Zaynab, which is a directional difference (not equality)

        lived slightly longer), even if small, rather than stating they died at exactly
        the same time. This difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Zaynab bint Jahsh

        (approximately 20 AH/641 CE)" but then adds "with some accounts suggesting
        Bilal may have died slightly later." This indicates the model believes there
        might be a slight difference in timing, not that they died at exactly the
        same time. The model is not saying NO because the values are exactly equal,
        but because the premise (Zaynab dying earlier) is not supported, and there's
        even a suggestion that the opposite might be true (Bilal dying later).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Based on historical

        dates is presented as the primary reason for the NO answer, with the model
        noting they died "around the same time" with only a possibility that "Bilal
        may have died slightly later" but without definitive evidence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal. Instead, it says "They died around the same time, with some accounts
        suggesting Bilal may have died slightly later." This indicates a difference
        in timing (Bilal dying slightly later), not exact equality, as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Zaynab bint Jahsh
        did not die earlier than Bilal ibn Ribah" as its final answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states "They died around the same time (approximately
        20 AH/641 CE)" as the reason for its NO answer. The model is explicitly stating
        that the values (death dates) are approximately the same/equal, and this equality
        is the primary reason given for the NO answer. While the model adds "with
        some sources suggesting Bilal may have died slightly earlier," this is presented
        as an uncertain alternative possibility rather than the main conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its final answer paragraph, indicating that Zaynab bint Jahsh did not die
        earlier than Bilal ibn Ribah. This is a clear negative response to the comparative
        question.

        same time period (around 316-315 BCE)" and this equality of time periods is
        the primary reason given for the NO answer. While the model adds "with some

        Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk did not die earlier than Agnes of Hesse."
        However, it then corrected itself and explicitly stated "YES - Thomas Howard,
        3rd Duke of Norfolk did die earlier than Agnes of Hesse." Since the final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (death dates)
        are exactly equal as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it states "Fan
        Kuai likely died around the same time as Emperor Hui or shortly after" and
        notes that "Fan Kuai died approximately around 189-187 BC" while "Emperor
        Hui died in 188 BC." The model is indicating a temporal relationship where
        Fan Kuai died either around the same time or after Emperor Hui, not that they
        died at exactly the same time. The primary reason for the NO is that Fan Kuai
        did not die earlier than Emperor Hui.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Fan Kuai did not

        the same time (around 188 BCE), it also indicates Fan Kuai likely died shortly
        after Emperor Hui. Since the model presents two possibilities (same time OR
        after) and doesn't definitively state they died at exactly the same time as
        the primary reason for the NO answer, this doesn't qualify as equal values
        being the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Fan Kuai did not

        the death dates.

        before him" but then concluding "with some historical accounts suggesting
        Fan Kuai may have even outlived Emperor Hui by a short period." The model
        indicates uncertainty about the exact timing and suggests Fan Kuai may have
        died after Emperor Hui, not that they died at precisely the same time.

        difference, and the main conclusion is that they died at approximately the
        same time.

        while Marcia died around 45-42 BCE, and concluded that "Zhang Qian died earlier
        than Marcia." The model's reasoning indicates a clear difference in death
        dates, not equality. The "NO" answer contradicts the model's own reasoning,
        but nowhere does it claim the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its
        response. This directly contradicts its own reasoning, as it concluded that
        "Zhang Qian died earlier than Marcia" but then gave "NO" as the answer. Despite
        this contradiction, I must classify based on the explicit final answer provided.
