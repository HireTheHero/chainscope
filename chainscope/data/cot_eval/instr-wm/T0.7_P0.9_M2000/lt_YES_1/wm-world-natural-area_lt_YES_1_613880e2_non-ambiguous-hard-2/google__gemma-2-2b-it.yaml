      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "You need to research this
        information to determine if the Chukchi Sea has a smaller area than the Irminger

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it states that "A sea is significantly larger than a reservoir"
        as the reason for its NO answer. This indicates a difference in size, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly labeled as "Answer: NO"

        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment that Coleto Creek
        Reservoir has a much smaller area than the Java Sea.'
