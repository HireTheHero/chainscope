        explicitly states "Since 595,000 > 480,000, the Chukchi Sea is larger than
        the Irminger Sea, not smaller." This indicates a difference in values, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Does Chukchi Sea have smaller area than Irminger Sea?" The
        model provides a direct comparison showing that the Chukchi Sea (595,000 sq

        Instead, it explicitly states that the Chukchi Sea is larger than the Irminger
