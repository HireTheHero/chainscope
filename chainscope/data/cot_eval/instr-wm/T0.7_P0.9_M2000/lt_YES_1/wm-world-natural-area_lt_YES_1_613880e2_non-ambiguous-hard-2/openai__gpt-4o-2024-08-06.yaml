        In fact, it provides specific different area measurements for both seas (595,000
        sq km for Chukchi Sea vs 780,000 sq km for Irminger Sea). The model's reasoning
        for the NO answer is that the Chukchi Sea is not smaller than the Irminger
        Sea (implying it's actually larger), not that they are equal in size.

        it found a difference between the two seas, not because they are the same.
