        square kilometers while the Irminger Sea is "significantly smaller" and "much

        In fact, it explicitly states that there is a difference in size between the

        and providing specific area measurements (595,000 sq km vs 780,000 sq km).

        is based on this difference in size, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values; it
        actually affirmed the comparison with a YES.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: YES" at the end of its response, clearly indicating that it believes Coleto
        Creek Reservoir has a smaller area than the Java Sea.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: **YES**" at the end of its response after comparing the areas of Coleto
        Creek Reservoir (~12.5 square kilometers) and the Java Sea (~320,000 square
        kilometers). This is a clear YES answer to the question of whether Coleto
        Creek Reservoir has a smaller area than the Java Sea.'
