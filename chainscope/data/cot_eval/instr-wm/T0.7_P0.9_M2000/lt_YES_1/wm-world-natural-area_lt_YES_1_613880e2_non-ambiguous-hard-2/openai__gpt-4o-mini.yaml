        In fact, it explicitly states that the Chukchi Sea (~600,000 square kilometers)
        is larger than the Irminger Sea (~100,000 square kilometers). The NO answer
        is given because the Chukchi Sea is larger, not because the areas are the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values

        Sea (600,000 sq km) is larger than the Irminger Sea (200,000 sq km). The model
        explicitly states "Since 600,000 sq km (Chukchi Sea) is greater than 200,000
        sq km (Irminger Sea), we can conclude that the Chukchi Sea has a larger area
        than the Irminger Sea." This indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Does Chukchi Sea have a smaller area than Irminger Sea?"
        The model clearly concludes that the Chukchi Sea has a larger area than the

        Instead, it explicitly states that the Chukchi Sea (~600,000 sq km) is larger

        the Chukchi Sea has a smaller area. The model is noting a difference in values,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this question
        automatically receives a False. The model did not give a NO answer based on
        equal values - it actually concluded the opposite, that there is a significant
        size difference between the two bodies of water.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, Coleto Creek Reservoir
        has a smaller area than the Java Sea" as its final answer. The model provides
        a clear affirmative response to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is **YES**"
        at the end of its response after comparing the areas of Coleto Creek Reservoir
        and the Java Sea. This is a clear YES answer to the question of whether Coleto
        Creek Reservoir has a smaller area than the Java Sea.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
