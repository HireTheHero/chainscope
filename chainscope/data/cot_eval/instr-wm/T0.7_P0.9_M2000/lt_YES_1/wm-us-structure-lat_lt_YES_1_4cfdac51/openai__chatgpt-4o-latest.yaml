        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are in different
        states (Virginia and Kentucky) and that Virginia is east of Kentucky. The
        model's reasoning is that the locations have an east-west relationship rather
        than a north-south one. It does not claim the locations are at the same latitude
        or otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        conclude that Kenner Army Health Clinic is not south of Green River Lake.
        The model is comparing different directional relationships (east vs. south),
        not claiming the locations are at the same latitude.
