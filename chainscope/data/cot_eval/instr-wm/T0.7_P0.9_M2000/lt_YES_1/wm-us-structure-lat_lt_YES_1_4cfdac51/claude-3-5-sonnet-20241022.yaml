      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes differences in their positions,
        stating that Whitman, MA is "slightly NORTH of West Saugerties, NY". The NO
        answer appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the relative geographical
        positions (MA being "east and slightly north of New York state"), not because
        the locations are at the same position. It explicitly notes a difference in
        position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Toll House Inn in MA is

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states they are in different positions, with
        Toll House Inn being northeast of Big Pink. The NO is because their relative
        positions are different from what was asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result that Toll House Inn is not south of

        never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate if equal values were
        the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive

        POSSIBLE" and indicates it cannot verify the comparison due to insufficient
        information about one location. This is a case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Arrowrock Dam being north of Eighth & Main), not because the locations are
        at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.

        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states they are in different
        positions with Wayfarers Chapel being northwest of Calvary Church. The NO
        is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a directional comparison showing Wayfarers Chapel is northwest
        of Calvary Church, therefore not south of it.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO is given because Wayfarers
        Chapel is explicitly stated to be north of Calvary Church, indicating a difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Wayfarers Chapel is north of Calvary Church of Santa Ana, not south of
        it. This is a direct comparative answer.

        they are exactly equal, and notes they are in different longitude positions,
        this does not qualify as stating they are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice,

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. In fact, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, saying BMO Plaza is "slightly south of where Cadle Tabernacle
        was located." Since it indicates a directional difference, even though described
        as "slight," this cannot be classified as equal values.

        is a difference in position, saying "BMO Plaza is not south of Cadle Tabernacle.
        It is north of it." The NO indicates an opposite relationship rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" twice - both in its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that BMO
        Plaza is north of where Cadle Tabernacle was located, not because the locations
        are the same. The model explicitly identifies a directional difference between
        the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they are "at almost exactly
        the same latitude," it also explicitly states "Pine Flat Lake is very slightly
        north of Navajo Lake." Any difference, even if described as minimal, means
        we cannot classify this as equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies that
        Pine Flat Lake is not south of Navajo Lake. This is a clear negative comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states they are "at almost exactly
        the same latitude" and uses this equality as the primary reason for its NO
        answer, saying "When positions are this close (within a fraction of a degree),
        the answer must be NO." The NO is directly based on their equal positions.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially notes they are "very close"
        and "at almost the same latitude", it ultimately specifies that Pine Flat
        Lake is "very slightly further north" than Navajo Lake. This indicates a difference,
        even if tiny, rather than exact equality being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Pine Flat Lake is
        not south of Navajo Lake" and provides a clear comparative result, indicating
        Pine Flat Lake is actually slightly further north.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different locations (Portland
        vs Salem) and concludes that one is north of the other. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is north of the other (indicating different positions), not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states that Portland
        is north of Salem and uses this difference to justify its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states they are in different
        locations (Portland vs Salem) with one being north of the other. The NO is
        because their relative positions are opposite to what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Mission Theater is north of Charles E. Nelson House,

        locations have different positions (one is north of the other), not because
        they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Queen Anne Hotel is north of Belden Place (not south). This is a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it actually stated they were in different positions, with Queen Anne
        Hotel being north of Belden Place. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of
        the two locations.

        the same coordinates or equally positioned. Instead, it reaches its NO conclusion
        by determining that the premise about Jersey City being south of Manhattan
        leads to a different relative positioning. Since equality is not mentioned
        as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the Raleigh Hotel
        is "slightly NORTH of the Cathedral's position," indicating a difference in
        position. The NO appears to be based on this directional difference.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - it explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        with Raleigh Hotel being further north (around 17th Street) and Cathedral
        of Saint Mary being further south (around 2nd Street).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Raleigh Hotel is NOT
        located south of Cathedral of Saint Mary" and provides a definitive comparative
        result, explaining that it's actually located north of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the latitudes are "very similar,"
        it explicitly states that Addicks is "slightly south" of Canyon Lake. Since
        any difference, even if described as slight, means the values are not exactly
        equal, and the main reason given for NO is that the east-west difference is
        more significant, this does not qualify as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Addicks Reservoir
        is not south of Canyon Lake" as its comparative conclusion. While it provides
        additional context, the NO answer is clear and direct.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly stated that Addicks Reservoir is southeast of Canyon
        Lake, indicating different locations. The NO appears to be answering whether
        one is directly south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, providing clear geographic reasoning for why one location
        is southeast (not directly south) of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the latitudes are "very similar,"
        it explicitly states there is a slight difference ("Addicks being just slightly
        south"). Since any difference, even if described as slight, means the values
        are not exactly equal, and this tiny difference is actually mentioned multiple
        times, this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Addicks Reservoir
        is not located south of Canyon Lake" as its final comparative answer, even
        though it notes they are at similar latitudes with Addicks being slightly
        south.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there is a directional difference
        (southeast vs. directly south). The NO appears to be because the premise of
        "directly south" is incorrect, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, indicating that Addicks
        Reservoir is southeast (not directly south) of Canyon Lake.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        it actually specifies that Minnesota is "slightly NORTH of most of Washington
        state" and concludes a location in Minnesota would be NORTH of a location
        in Washington. While it notes they are at "roughly similar latitudes," it
        explicitly states there is a difference, making this a directional NO rather
        than an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing reasoning about geographical locations and latitudes.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that Minnesota and Washington
        are "roughly at the same latitude range," this is not presented as the reason
        for the NO answer. The model actually emphasizes that Minnesota is EAST of
        Washington, indicating a directional difference rather than equality as the
        basis for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

    43b5df2e-103a-4579-b8ab-ef4ba9d9e1b0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the locations are at "similar"
        latitudes, it also specifically states Minnesota is "generally at similar
        or slightly lower latitudes than Washington" - indicating a difference, even
        if small. The model does not explicitly state they are exactly equal as the
        reason for its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        it actually noted that Star Lite Motel would be "at a similar latitude or
        slightly lower than Lake Steilacoom." Even noting a possible slight difference
        means this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis
      final_answer: 'NO'

    81ce6dc1-41f7-4ffb-aa24-280efe4190f7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions the locations are at "similar"
        latitudes, it still notes that Minnesota is "slightly lower" than Washington
        in some areas. This slight difference means they are not exactly equal, and
        equality is not given as the primary reason for the NO answer. The NO is explained
        by directional reasoning (being "primarily east" rather than south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing a clear directional explanation for why one location is
        not south of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they are at "similar latitude,"
        it also states that Star Lite Motel would be "at a similar latitude or slightly
        north of it." Since it indicates a possible directional difference (slightly
        north), this is not a case where equality is the primary reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Star Lite Motel,
        MN is not located south of Lake Steilacoom, WA" as its final comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8ae802aa-430d-4bae-b7f2-67ea5c37fd4c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that Minnesota and Washington
        are "roughly at similar latitudes," it explicitly states there is a difference,
        with Minnesota being "slightly NORTH." The NO answer is based on this difference
        in latitude, not on the locations being equal/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Star Lite Motel cannot be south
        of Lake Steilacoom because Minnesota is north of Washington state.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are at "roughly similar latitudes"
        and this similarity appears to be the primary reason for the NO answer. The
        model doesn't indicate any north-south difference between the locations, instead
        emphasizing their similar positioning with "both states sharing similar northern
        boundaries."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after its step-by-step analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    aa684039-6906-43ff-a655-4bafbe753aa3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model did not
        claim the locations were equal - it stated it lacked sufficient data to make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO - I cannot definitively
        say..." which indicates it cannot determine the comparison due to insufficient
        data. This is a case where the model states it cannot make the determination,
        making it an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they are at "similar latitudes,"
        it doesn't state they are exactly equal. The phrase "similar latitudes" suggests
        they are close but not identical, and this similarity is presented as supporting
        context rather than the primary reason for the NO answer. The primary reason
        given is that Minnesota is not south of Washington.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, explaining that Minnesota is not south of Washington state.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference, saying Boone
        Lake is "slightly NORTH of Lake Gaston." Even though they are described as
        "very close in latitude," a directional difference is still specified.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Boone Lake, TN is
        NOT located south of Lake Gaston, NC" and provides a clear comparative result,
        even though it corrects its reasoning.

        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with Trinity Dam being "slightly north and east" of Carson Mansion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - both in the
        explanation and as the final answer, making a clear comparative directional
        statement that Trinity Dam is "slightly north and east" rather than south
        of Carson Mansion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Trinity Dam
        is "north of Carson Mansion" and describes their positions as different (one
        being inland/east and slightly north, the other being closer to coast and
        slightly south). The NO is based on the direction being opposite to what was
        asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        locations are the same or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reaffirms this with an explanation, making it clear that the Thompson
        Center is south of the Church (though there appears to be confusion in the
        logic since finding something IS south would typically warrant a YES answer).

        in fact, it explicitly noted that San Bernardino (where the California Theatre
        is) is "slightly further north than San Dimas." This difference in position,
        even though described as "slight," means the NO answer was not due to equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it explicitly stated there was a difference, saying "San Bernardino
        is slightly north of San Dimas". This directional difference, even though
        described as "slight", means the values are not equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes differences, stating that San Bernardino
        is "slightly north of San Dimas" and that San Dimas is "west of San Bernardino".
        The NO answer is based on these directional differences, not on equality of
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly
        states "the California Theatre in San Bernardino is NOT south of the San Dimas
        Hotel." This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Moody Church being "further north" than Wheaton Bible Church),
        not because the locations are equal. The model explicitly states there is
        a difference in position.

        Church is "slightly NORTH"). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on the locations being exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a specific directional explanation (that Moody Church is slightly
        NORTH of Wheaton Bible Church). Despite the model noting it reversed its initial
        reasoning, it provides a definitive NO answer.

        the same latitude," it also mentions "only a minimal difference between them"
        and earlier states "Moody Church is further east and slightly further south."
        Since it acknowledges some difference exists, even if minimal, this does not
        qualify as stating they are exactly equal as the primary reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Moody Church is
        not definitively south of Wheaton Bible Church" as its final answer. This
        is a clear NO response to the comparative question.

        and have "minimal difference" as the reason for its NO answer. While it notes
        a "minimal difference," the presence of any difference, even if described
        as minimal, means we cannot classify this as equal values being the reason
        for the NO answer.
