        they are at the same location. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states that Riffe
        Lake is "farther south than Dworshak Dam," indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was given because their relative positions are opposite to what
        was asked (Dworshak Dam is north of Riffe Lake, not south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit directional reasoning that Dworshak Dam is not south of Riffe

        is located north of Riffe Lake").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        Dworshak Dam being in northern Idaho. The NO answer is based on their relative
        positions being opposite to what was asked, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        there is a directional difference - that Dworshak Dam is north of Riffe Lake,
        not south. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, directly addressing the comparative question of whether Dworshak

        House is north of St. Aloysius Church, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that the Cutts-Madison House is north of (not south of)
        St. Aloysius Church.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal/same
        - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Cutts-Madison
        House is north of St. Aloysius Church). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        north of I Street where St. Aloysius Church is), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly identifies a directional difference.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explained that Clinton
        Lake is east of Red Bluff Diversion Dam, which was its reason for saying NO
        to the "south of" comparison.

        - instead, it explicitly states differences in location, noting that AFI Silver

        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference ("Silver Spring, MD, is north of Lake Monroe, IN"). The NO answer
        is given because it found one location to be north of the other, not because
        they are at the same latitude.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are at the same latitude. The model explicitly states that Moody
        Church is north of Wheaton Bible Church, indicating a difference in latitude.
        The NO answer was given because one location is north of the other, not because
        they are at equal latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative reasoning that Moody Church is north of Wheaton Bible
        Church, therefore it is not south of it.
