        that Brick Presbyterian Church is located NORTH of 257 Central Park West (at
        different locations - 91st Street vs. 85th-86th Street). The model explicitly
        states the locations are different, not equal.

        in the last line of its response. The model determined that Brick Presbyterian
        Church is located NORTH of 257 Central Park West, not south, and therefore

        Brick Presbyterian Church is at 91st Street while 257 Central Park West is
        at approximately 86th Street, and since street numbers increase northward,
        the church is north of the other location.
