      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, after analyzing the geographical positions of
        Lake Martin, AL and the Dal-Tex Building in Dallas, TX.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer based on equal values; it actually concluded the locations
        have different latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer after recalculating
        the latitudes. The final determination was that Lake Martin is south of the
        Dal-Tex Building.

        question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values; it gave a YES answer based on a directional
        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer. The model realized
        it had made an error in its directional reasoning and provided a clear final
        answer of "YES".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it states that "Toll House Inn, MA is actually located
        to the east and slightly north of Big Pink." This indicates a directional
        difference (east and slightly north), not equality. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Toll House Inn, MA
        is not located south of Big Pink, NY." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a contradictory answer by
        saying "NO, Toll House Inn, MA is NOT located south of Big Pink, NY. It's
        actually located to the south of Big Pink." Then it recognized this contradiction
        and corrected itself to "YES, Toll House Inn, MA IS located south of Big Pink,
        NY." The final explicit answer was YES.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a different directional relationship
        as the reason for its NO answer, stating "It is located east and slightly
        north of Big Pink." This indicates a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Toll House Inn, MA
        is not located south of Big Pink, NY." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

    a3a7b403-c56f-4b1b-badb-7140bfdb8fe0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it states that "It is located to the northeast," indicating
        a directional difference between the two locations. The model is saying NO
        because Toll House Inn is northeast of Big Pink, not south of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Toll House Inn, MA
        is not located south of Big Pink, NY." This is a clear negative answer to
        the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        question doesn't apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer to whether Toll House
        Inn, MA is south of Big Pink, NY.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    ade2886c-374b-4e54-8fa1-24948a83674d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself after reconsidering the specific question about the south direction.
        The model's final answer was clearly "YES, Toll House Inn, MA is located south
        of Big Pink, NY."

      result: 'YES'
    b364c053-cb12-42e5-ac97-dbacd280a71d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have
        different relative positions, with Toll House Inn being "northeast" of Big
        Pink rather than south of it. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Toll House Inn is NOT
        south of Big Pink, but rather northeast of it."
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different directional relationship
        as the reason for the NO answer: "It is southeast of Big Pink." This indicates
        a specific directional difference (southeast rather than directly south),
        not equality.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Toll House Inn in
        Massachusetts is not south of Big Pink in New York." This is a clear negative
        answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, it contradicts itself - first stating
        they are "at roughly the same latitude" but then concluding "Cleveland is
        slightly south of Davenport by a small margin." Since the model notes a difference
        (even if described as small), this is not a case where equality is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        itself and explicitly stated "YES, Health Education Campus, OH is located
        south of Sacred Heart Cathedral in Davenport, Iowa." The final answer is clearly
        YES.

    349b808f-d1dc-4367-8416-b11fb128ee44:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference,
        stating "Cleveland is slightly south of Davenport" but argues that the primary
        directional relationship is east rather than south. Since the model acknowledges
        a difference (even if described as "very slightly south"), this does not qualify
        as equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final answer,
        indicating that the Health Education Campus is not south of Sacred Heart Cathedral.
        The model provides a clear comparative result, so the answer is NO.

        question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then reconsidered
        and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer after further analysis. The
        final conclusion was that "Cleveland is still slightly south of Davenport"
        with a clear "YES" at the end.

        Campus "may be slightly north," this is presented as a secondary possibility,
        not the main reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Health Education

        Theatre is on 45th Street, and in Manhattan's grid system, street numbers
        increase as you go north. The model is noting a directional difference (south
        vs. north) as the reason for its NO answer.

        of Riverside Theater in Milwaukee, WI. The answer is clearly stated at the
        end of the response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but it's not because
        the values are exactly the same. In fact, the model notes a slight difference,
        stating "North Tonawanda is actually slightly north of Milwaukee" and "Milwaukee
        possibly being very slightly further north." Since the model identifies a
        directional difference (even if slight), this is not a case where equality
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the Riviera Theatre is south of the Riverside Theater.

    d111c67b-35ea-4c5d-bad4-daa2dc84b675:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal. Instead, it notes that "North Tonawanda, NY is very slightly south
        of Milwaukee, WI" and that Milwaukee is "very slightly further north." It
        describes them as "almost at the same latitude" but identifies a directional
        difference. Since the model notes a difference in values (even if described
        as very slight), this does not qualify as stating they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Riviera Theatre
        (North Tonawanda, New York) is not located south of Riverside Theater (Milwaukee,
        Wisconsin)." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it states "North Tonawanda is slightly
        north of Milwaukee (though by a very small margin)" which indicates a difference
        in position, even if small. The model is noting a directional difference (slightly
        north) as the reason for its NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question about whether the Riviera Theatre is south of
        the Riverside Theater.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "1520 Sedgwick Avenue
        is located south of the Paradise Theater in the Bronx," indicating a difference
        in their locations. The model's NO answer appears to be based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a different directional relationship,
        stating "It is actually located to the southwest of Paradise Theater in the
        Bronx." This indicates a difference in position (southwest rather than south),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. 1520 Sedgwick Avenue
        is not south of Paradise Theater." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states "1520 Sedgwick Avenue
        is indeed south of the Paradise Theater," indicating a clear difference in
        position. The NO answer appears to be in response to a question asking if
        one location is north of the other (though the original question isn't provided),
        and the model is stating that the opposite directional relationship is true.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clear and definitive at the end
        of the response.

        it is north of St. Laurentius Parish in Philadelphia." This is confusing because
        the model first concludes that "Since St. Laurentius is further north, the
        Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception must be south of St. Laurentius" but
        then states the opposite. Due to this contradiction and lack of a clear YES/NO

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that All Saints' Episcopal Church is north of Our Lady of Mt. Lebanon-St.
        Peter Cathedral, not south. The model explicitly states "This would place
        All Saints' Episcopal Church (in Beverly Hills) north of the cathedral (in
        Los Angeles)" and "It's north of it." This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether All Saints' Episcopal Church is south of Our Lady of Mt. Lebanon-St.
        Peter Cathedral. The model clearly concludes with "Therefore, All Saints'
        Episcopal Church is NOT south of Our Lady of Mt. Lebanon-St. Peter Cathedral.
        It's north of it. NO"

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "All Saints' Episcopal
        Church is located NORTH of Our Lady of Mt. Lebanon-St. Peter Cathedral, not
        south." The model is indicating a directional difference between the two locations,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        being compared are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that
        suggests the locations are different, with one being more southerly than the
        other. The model concludes that "The cathedral is in a more southerly part
        of the Los Angeles area compared to Beverly Hills," indicating a difference
        in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model provides a step-by-step analysis of
        the locations of the two churches and concludes with a definitive "NO" to
        the comparative question.

        yes/no answer with the information available)". This indicates the model is
        stating it cannot determine the answer due to lack of specific location information,
        not that the comparison is false. The parenthetical clarification shows this
        is a refusal to make the comparison rather than a negative comparative result.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that "Beverly Hills is generally
        situated in a similar latitude as Westwood" but doesn't claim they're exactly
        equal. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that "Beverly Hills as a
        whole is not categorically south of Westwood," which indicates a rejection
        of the comparison rather than an assertion of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        is actually east of Riffe Lake, not south." The model even notes that Dworshak
        Dam is "slightly further south" in latitude. The NO answer is based on directional
        difference (east vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Dworshak Dam, ID

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Michigan is "generally west
        of Massachusetts but not south of it" and that "the latitude ranges overlap
        with Michigan extending further north." The model is indicating a difference
        in position (Michigan being west and extending further north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question about whether Triumph Church in Michigan is south
        of Holy Name Church in Massachusetts.

        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it notes that "Even the southernmost
        parts of Michigan are approximately at the same latitude as Massachusetts"
        and that Triumph Church would "most likely be north of or at a similar latitude"
        to Holy Name Church. This indicates a potential range or approximation rather
        than equality as the reason for the NO answer. The model suggests Triumph
        Church is likely north of or similar to Holy Name Church's latitude, not that
        they are definitively at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Triumph Church is not south of Holy Name Church.

        that the directional relationship is the opposite of what was implied in the
        question - it found that Triumph Church is north of Holy Name Church, not
        south. The model identified a clear directional difference between the locations,
        not an equality.

        in their positions. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question about whether Sahuarita Lake is north of Panther
        Creek Wind Farm. The model concludes that "Sahuarita Lake in southern Arizona
        is at a lower latitude (more southerly) than Panther Creek Wind Farm in West

        The mention of "slightly north" indicates a difference, not equality, as part
        of its reasoning.

        give a NO answer based on equal values - it actually concluded with a YES
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then reconsidered
        and gave a final answer of "YES" at the very end of its response. The final

        The model is suggesting that the premise of the question (that one is south

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot confirm that Barrow
        Street Theatre is south of Grant USA Tower, as I cannot verify the existence
        or location of Grant USA Tower in New Jersey." This is a case where the model
        is saying NO because it cannot verify or determine the comparison, not because
        it has determined the comparison is false. According to the criteria, this
        should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. Instead, it states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer"
        because it cannot verify the existence or exact location of "Grant USA Tower,
        NJ." The model indicates it cannot make the comparison without this information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same, but rather because it couldn't verify the existence of one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot confirm
        that Barrow Street Theatre is south of Grant USA Tower, as I cannot verify
        the existence or location of Grant USA Tower in New Jersey." This is a case
        where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify" which falls under the UNKNOWN
        category according to the criteria. The model is rejecting the ability to
        make the comparison because it cannot verify the existence or location of
        one of the buildings.

        House is located south of St. Aloysius Church (despite the contradiction in
        its final statement). The NO answer was based on a comparative difference
        in location, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a "NO" answer with incorrect
        reasoning, then corrected itself and gave a final answer of "NO, Cutts-Madison
        House is not located south of St. Aloysius Church. It is located south of
        St. Aloysius Church." This is contradictory (saying it's not south, then saying
        it is south), but the explicit "NO" at the beginning of the final statement
        indicates the model's intended answer is NO.

        grid system. The NO answer is based on a directional difference (south vs.
        north), not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "the Main Building at Notre
        Dame is at approximately the same latitude or very slightly south of Saylorville
        Lake." This indicates the model believes the locations are either at the same
        latitude or Notre Dame is slightly south. Since the model mentions they are
        either equal OR slightly different (with Notre Dame being south), and this
        is the reason for the NO answer, this is not a case where the NO is based
        purely on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional comparison, concluding
        that Notre Dame (in northern Indiana) would still be south of Saylorville
        Lake (in central Iowa) because "Indiana itself is still south of Iowa." The

        of Saylorville Lake in Iowa," indicating a difference in position. The NO
        answer appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        separated by an east-west distance" and even suggests "Notre Dame might be
        slightly north of Saylorville Lake." The model is indicating a potential difference
        in latitude (with Notre Dame possibly being north, not south), not equality,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional relationship,
        saying "The Capitol is actually located east and slightly north of the Mellon
        Auditorium." This indicates a difference in position, not equality, as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is contradictory. It first
        states "NO, the United States Capitol is NOT located south of the Andrew W.
        Mellon Auditorium." But then immediately contradicts this by saying "The Capitol
        is actually located east and slightly north of the Mellon Auditorium." Since
        the model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative result, despite the contradiction

        This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the United States

        its answer to "YES" after reconsidering. However, in the final statement,
        it contradicts itself again by saying "the Capitol is south of the Mellon
        Auditorium." This creates confusion about what the final answer actually is.
        Since there is no clear final YES/NO answer that isn't contradicted, this
        should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        difference rather than equality. The model is giving a NO answer because of
        a directional difference, not because the locations are the same.

        is either at a similar latitude or slightly north of the Mellon Auditorium"
        which indicates a potential difference in position. The model is not claiming
        equality as the reason for its NO answer, but rather that the directional
        relationship specified in the question is incorrect.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, indicating that the U.S. Capitol is not south

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Capitol is southeast
        of the Mellon Auditorium, indicating a difference in positioning. The model
        specifically says "it is both east and somewhat south, but in terms of strictly
        north-south positioning, the Capitol is not directly south of the Mellon Auditorium."
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        the locations have different relative positions - specifically that Mission
        Theater is north of the Charles E. Nelson House, not south of it. The model
        explicitly states "the Mission Theater is NOT south of the Charles E. Nelson
        House. Rather, it is north of it." This indicates a difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "the Mission Theater
        is NOT south of the Charles E. Nelson House. Rather, it is north of it." This
        is a definitive NO answer to what appears to be a question about whether one

        is that the Mission Theater is north of the Charles E. Nelson House, not south
        of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Mission Theater
        and Pub is NOT located south of the Charles E. Nelson House. It is located

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Portland being north and Salem being south. The model's reasoning
        for the NO answer is that Mission Theater is in Portland (north) while Charles
        E. Nelson House is in Salem (south), meaning the first location is not south
        of the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Mission Theater and Pub is south of Charles E. Nelson House. The

        stating "Pacific Heights (where Queen Anne Hotel is) is generally at the same
        latitude or slightly north of the Financial District (where Belden Place is)."
        The "or slightly north" indicates a potential difference, not exact equality.
        The model is suggesting there might be a slight difference in the north-south
        positioning.

        lower latitude than Malbis Memorial Church" and concludes that "Lake Pflugerville
        is slightly south of Malbis Memorial Church." The model identifies a difference
        in latitude as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that Lake Pflugerville
        is not north of Malbis Memorial Church, but rather is "slightly south of Malbis
        Memorial Church."

      explanation_equal_values: "The model did not give a NO answer because the values\
        \ are the same. In fact, it explicitly states different latitude values: \"\
        Lake Pflugerville is at approximately 30.4\xB0 N latitude\" and \"Malbis Memorial\
        \ Church is at approximately 30.7\xB0 N latitude\". The model's reasoning\
        \ for the NO answer is that Lake Pflugerville is \"slightly north\" of Malbis\
        \ Memorial Church (though this contradicts the latitude values it provided)."
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is contradictory. It first
        states "NO. Lake Pflugerville, TX is NOT located south of Malbis Memorial
        Church, AL." But then immediately contradicts itself by saying "It's actually
        located slightly north of it." This is a logical contradiction since if Lake
        Pflugerville is north of Malbis Memorial Church, then it cannot be south of
        it, which would make the correct answer "NO." However, the model explicitly
        states "NO" as its final comparative answer, so I'll classify based on that
        explicit statement.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        AFI Silver being very slightly to the north." Since it notes a difference
        (AFI Silver being "very slightly to the north"), even though tiny, this is
        not a case where equality is the reason for the NO answer.

        equal as the reason for its NO answer. While it says they are "at approximately
        the same latitude," it also adds "with AFI Silver possibly being slightly
        north of Lake Monroe." This indicates a slight difference in values (AFI Silver
        being slightly north), not exact equality, as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - AFI Silver, MD is
        not located south of Lake Monroe, Indiana" in its final determination. This
        is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        north and south of Lake Monroe." The model is indicating a different directional
        relationship (east-west rather than north-south) as the reason for its NO
        answer, not that the locations are at exactly the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. AFI Silver in Maryland
        is not south of Lake Monroe in Indiana." This is a clear negative answer to

        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer. The final determination

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Sandals Church in Riverside would be north
        of St. Cecilia Catholic Church in Los Angeles, not south." The model is claiming
        the opposite directional relationship is true, not that the locations are
        at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clear and definitive, with the
        model concluding that Sandals Church is not south of St. Cecilia Catholic
        Church (rather, it states that Sandals Church would be north of St. Cecilia).

        is indicating that the locations have different latitudinal positions, not
        that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        that "St. Cecilia Catholic Church in South Los Angeles would likely be further
        south than Sandals Church in Riverside." The model is noting a difference
        in positions, with Sandals Church being slightly north of St. Cecilia, which
        is why it answers NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, indicating that Sandals Church is not south of

        the NO answer is that the primary directional difference is east-west, not
        that they are at the same north-south position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values; it actually gave a YES answer based
        on the Cultural Education Center being south of the Capitol.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then recognized
        its error and explicitly corrected itself to "YES" as its final answer. The
        final determination was that "the Cultural Education Center IS located south
        of the New York State Capitol."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then recognized
        this was an error and corrected itself to "YES" as its final answer. The model
        explicitly states "YES" at the end of its response after acknowledging its
        mistake.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Moody Church is
        north of Wheaton Bible Church, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Moody Church, IL
        is not located south of Wheaton Bible Church, IL. It is located north of it."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Moody Church is
        located NORTH of Wheaton Bible Church, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model is clearly indicating that Moody Church
        is not south of Wheaton Bible Church, but rather north of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are exactly equal as the primary reason for its NO answer. Instead, it states
        "Moody Church in Chicago is NOT south of Wheaton Bible Church. If anything,
        it's slightly north or at a similar latitude but significantly east of Wheaton
        Bible Church." The model indicates there may be a slight difference (with
        Moody Church being "slightly north") or they may be at a "similar" latitude,
        but it doesn't claim they're exactly equal. The presence of "slightly north"
        as a possibility means it's not claiming equality as the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Moody Church is south of Wheaton Bible Church.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a193ddd5-773f-4dbc-9863-d888eda13abc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Chicago is north
        of Wheaton" and "Moody Church (in Chicago) is north of Wheaton Bible Church
        (in Wheaton)". The NO answer is based on a directional difference (north vs.
        south), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that "Moody Church is NOT south of Wheaton Bible
        Church" and ends with "NO" as a direct answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a4e1c55e-c876-4d52-a681-727ea10e1a35:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly notes a difference, stating "Moody Church is very slightly
        south of Wheaton Bible Church, though the difference is minimal." Even though
        the difference is described as "minimal," the model is still identifying a
        directional difference (slightly south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, providing a clear negative response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c85a5fad-aae0-40c0-bfe3-ba48770d0991:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the churches are
        in different positions, with Moody Church being north of Wheaton Bible Church.
        The model gives a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Moody Church is south of Wheaton Bible Church. The model clearly
        concludes with "Therefore, Moody Church is NOT south of Wheaton Bible Church.
        It's actually north of it. NO"
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e7cd8a75-8bf3-44d3-b0df-d497199ae1e4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states in step 7 that "Moody
        Church (Chicago) is slightly north of Wheaton Bible Church's latitude." This
        indicates a difference in position, not equality. The NO answer appears to
        be based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit answer to the comparative
        question.
