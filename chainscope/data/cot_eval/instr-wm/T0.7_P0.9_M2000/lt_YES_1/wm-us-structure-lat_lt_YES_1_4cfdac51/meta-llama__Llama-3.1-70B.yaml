      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying Lake Martin is "more to the east and south" compared to
        Dal-Tex Building. The NO answer is given because the model concludes Lake
        Martin is not south of Dal-Tex Building, not because they're at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result based on its geographic analysis,

        - instead, it explicitly states there are directional differences, noting
        that Lake Martin is "more to the east and north" compared to the Dal-Tex Building.
        The NO answer is based on these directional differences, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as an answer because it determines
        there is a directional difference - it explicitly states that Lake Martin
        is "more to the east and north" compared to the Dal-Tex Building which is
        "to the west and somewhat south." The NO is not based on the locations being
        equal or the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it gives a NO answer based
        on its reasoning that Lake Martin would be east of the Dal-Tex Building, not
        south of it. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as an answer because it determined
        that Toll House Inn is "more to the east and somewhat south" compared to Big
        Pink, not because the locations are equal. In fact, it explicitly describes
        different positions for the two locations.

        it never states that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer appears
        to be given due to inability to verify the relationship, not because the locations
        are identical. Since the final answer was NO but equality was not given as
        the reason, this is False.

        never claimed the locations were at equal coordinates - it simply stated it
        couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explains this is due to
        inability to determine the relative positions ("Without more precise information...it's
        not possible to definitively answer"). This indicates the model cannot make
        the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative

        a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate if equal values were the reason for a NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NEED MORE INFORMATION"
        and indicates it cannot make a definitive determination about the relative
        positions. This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.

        the same latitude or exactly equal in position. While it mentions they are
        "relatively close" and "in close proximity," it does not claim they are at
        the same position. The NO answer appears to stem from inability to verify
        the relationship rather than from equality of positions.

        are exactly equal or identical in position. The NO appears to be based on
        uncertainty about relative positions rather than equality. The model states
        "not necessarily south of" which implies potential difference rather than
        equality.

        it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO" in a box, the reasoning
        indicates it "cannot definitively state" the relative positions and lacks
        "specific details" to make the determination. This makes it clear that the
        model is expressing inability to determine the answer rather than making a

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Arizona is "more to the west and slightly north of Alabama"). This difference,
        not equality, is the reason for the NO answer.

        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with the Cathedral being "west and slightly north" of the Medical
        Center. Any directional difference, even if described as "slight," means we
        must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        they are "not significantly displaced" and are in "relatively close proximity,"
        but this is not the same as stating they are equal. The NO answer is based

        model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in a boxed answer
        at the end. However, in the explanation, it states it "cannot conclusively
        say" which location is south of the other, indicating it cannot determine
        the answer. This makes this a case where the model indicates it cannot make

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitude or the same position. Instead, it gives NO as an answer because
        it determines that Betts House is not south of Glenn Cunningham Lake based
        on the "general geographic layout of the United States." The model indicates
        these are different locations with different positions.

        that Lake Accotink is "more to the east and slightly south" while Hardy Lake
        is "more to the west and north." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives NO as an answer because it determines that
        Hardy Lake is in Indiana which is east of Virginia where Lake Accotink is
        located. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as an answer because it determined
        Hardy Lake is "more to the west and north" compared to Lake Accotink, not
        because the locations are equal. It explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes differences in their positions, stating "Hardy
        Lake is generally west and slightly south of Lake Accotink." The NO answer
        is given because of this directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that All Saints' Episcopal Church is "to the
        west and slightly north" of where Our Lady of Mt. Lebanon-St. Peter Cathedral
        is located. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/identical/the
        same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because they are "within the same general
        area" and because it lacks precise information. Being in the "same general
        area" is not the same as being at equal coordinates/positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with a clear "NO" answer, marked
        in a box. While it discusses uncertainty earlier, it ultimately commits to
        this answer, even if the reasoning seems uncertain. We must take the explicit
        final answer at face value.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (one church being north of the other), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states that Beverly Hills is north of Los
        Angeles where the respective churches are located.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same in terms of their north-south positioning. Instead, it states
        they are "relatively close" and "not significantly south," which implies some
        difference exists, even if small. The NO answer appears to be based on this
        relative positioning rather than exact equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or elevation. Instead, it gives a NO answer because Beverly
        Hills is described as being "to the west" of downtown Los Angeles, not south.
        The difference in position (west vs. downtown) is the reason for the NO answer,
        not equality of positions.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        discussion of relative positions or proximity.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNDETERMINED" as its
        final answer and explains that it cannot definitively determine the north-south
        relationship without more precise coordinates. This indicates inability to
        make the comparison, which maps to UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as an answer because it determines
        the locations are different - specifically stating that All Saints' is "west
        or southwest" of Our Lady of Mt. Lebanon-St. Peter Cathedral. The NO is not
        based on the locations being equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason for
        its NO answer, specifically noting that Beverly Hills is west of Los Angeles.
        Even though this is not directly related to the north-south comparison being
        asked about, the model's NO answer is based on a perceived difference in location
        rather than equality.

        with Dworshak Dam being "more to the east and north compared to Riffe Lake."
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative geographic
        positions (Idaho being east of Washington), not because the locations are
        at the same position. The model actually indicates the locations are different
        (in different states) and gives directional differences as the reason for
        its answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitude or have the same north-south position. Instead, it gives a
        different reason for the NO answer, based on the relative east-west positioning
        of the locations and their states. The model never claims the locations are
        at the same latitude or equally north/south of each other.

        there is a directional difference, stating that "Riffe Lake is... slightly
        south compared to Dworshak Dam" and that Dworshak Dam is "somewhat north in
        relation." Even though these differences might be small, any stated difference
        means this is not a case of equal values.

        Dam is in northern Idaho (east of Washington) while Riffe Lake is in southwestern
        Washington, indicating different positions. The NO was based on their relative

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Riffe Lake is north of Dworshak Dam, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was given because the model determined their relative positions

        significantly different in their north-south positioning" and are "more on
        the same north-south latitude," it does not explicitly state they are exactly
        equal or identical. The phrasing suggests approximate similarity rather than
        exact equality, and this approximate similarity is used to explain why one
        is not south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with a boxed "NO" as
        its final answer. While it expresses some uncertainty in the explanation ("cannot
        definitively say"), it does provide a clear NO answer rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating inability to determine.

        couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but the reasoning indicates
        uncertainty ("we cannot conclusively determine"). Since the model explicitly
        states it cannot determine the relationship and lacks sufficient information,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than a comparative NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the locations
        are equal/same/identical. Instead, it gave NO based on reasoning about Memphis's
        southwestern location and likelihood of other Tennessee locations being south
        of it. The model actually acknowledges uncertainty about the exact relative
        positions.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNKNOWN" as its final

        are at exactly the same location or latitude. Instead, it indicates that it
        cannot determine their relative positions due to lack of specific information.
        The NO appears to be based on inability to verify the south relationship rather
        than on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at

        that Times Square Church is on a north-south avenue while Ziegfeld Theatre
        is on an east-west street. The model concludes "Times Square Church is not
        south of Ziegfeld Theatre" based on their relative positions, not because
        they are at the same location.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly noted a difference in their positions,
        concluding that Times Square Church is located north of Ziegfeld Theatre based
        on street numbers. The NO answer was given because of this directional difference,
        not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The final answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with a clear "NO" answer, but
        the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the relative positions due to
        limited information. This makes it a case where the model states it cannot
        make the determination, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        positions. The NO answer is based on directional analysis, not equality of
        positions.

        indicates a different spatial relationship rather than equality as the reason
        for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as an answer because Arrowrock
        Dam is east of Eighth & Main, not because the locations are at the same latitude.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("east of Boise"),
        so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Arrowrock Dam
        is north of Eighth & Main, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO answer comes from this directional difference, not
        from equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in a box notation, indicating that Arrowrock Dam is not south of Eighth &
        Main (because it's north of it). This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because Arrowrock
        Dam is "more to the north compared to Eighth & Main" - indicating a directional
        difference, not equality. The model never states or implies the locations
        are at the same latitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same coordinates or equal positions. Instead, it gives a NO answer based
        on its reasoning about relative positions, stating "it's likely that Arrowrock
        Dam is not south of Eighth & Main" due to their locations relative to Boise
        city.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it gives a directional difference, noting that Arrowrock
        Dam is east of Boise while Eighth & Main is within Boise, and uses this difference
        to conclude NO. Even though the north-south relationship isn't explicitly
        stated, the model is clearly basing its NO answer on a difference in position
        rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same coordinates or equal position. Instead, it suggests they are "likely
        not far apart" and "unlikely that Arrowrock Dam would be significantly south,"
        but this indicates a relative positioning rather than equality. The NO answer
        appears to be based on the model's inference about relative positions, not
        because the locations are exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:
        **NO**" as its final comparative answer, making this a clear NO response.'

        the same latitude or equal position. Instead, it indicates that Arrowrock
        Dam is east of Eighth & Main, and "not significantly south or north of it."
        This describes a relative position difference, even if small, rather than
        equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result based on its geographic analysis,

        saying "Arrowrock Dam is to the east and slightly north of Eighth & Main."
        The NO answer is based on the dam not being south of the intersection, rather
        than the locations being equal.

        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with Arrowrock Dam being "more to the east" relative to Eighth
        & Main. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        is given because the model determines one location is east of the other, not
        because they are the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Boulder City Hospital is west
        of Durham Performing Arts Center, indicating a difference in location. The
        NO answer is given because of this directional difference (west), not because
        the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are different, with Boulder
        City Hospital being west/northwest of Durham Performing Arts Center. The NO
        answer is based on directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as an answer because it found that
        Boulder City Hospital is "west and slightly north" compared to Durham Performing
        Arts Center. The NO is based on a directional difference, not because the
        locations are at the same position.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the NO was given because Boulder City
        Hospital was determined to be southwest (not directly south) of Durham Performing
        Arts Center, indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

        (southwest vs. south), not because the locations are at the same position.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying "not
        directly south" and "more accurately southwest".

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (California being west of New Mexico), not on the locations being equal. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations,
        with one being west of the other.

        its analysis of relative positions, indicating that Pine Flat Lake is not
        south of Navajo Lake due to their different positions within their respective
        states. The model does not claim the locations are equal/same/identical.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitude or have the same north-south position. Instead, it gives NO
        as an answer based on their relative east-west positions, noting that Pine
        Flat Lake is "more to the west" compared to Navajo Lake. The model does not
        base its NO answer on equality of positions.

        Pine Flat Lake is "more to the west and north compared to Navajo Lake" - indicating
        a difference in position, not equality. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, so this is not a case of equal values.

        locations are equal/same. Instead, the model indicates that Pine Flat Lake
        would be to the west of Navajo Lake, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO is based on directional difference (west vs south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes "NO" and emphasizes
        this with a boxed "NO" answer at the end. The model makes a clear comparative
        judgment that Pine Flat Lake is not south of Navajo Lake (stating it would
        be to the west instead).

        difference, with one being in Northwest Portland and the other in Southeast
        Portland.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        equal latitudes or have the same north-south position. Instead, it explains
        that they are in more of an east-west alignment rather than north-south, and
        bases its NO answer on this directional difference. Even though the difference

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional comparison
        where it determines Lake Pflugerville is "further north" than Malbis Memorial
        Church. The NO is not due to the locations being at equal latitudes, but rather
        because one is explicitly stated to be more northern than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO is due to the geographic
        relationship between Texas and Alabama, stating it's "unlikely that any location
        in Texas would be south of a location in Alabama." This is a directional difference,
        not an equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as an answer because it determined
        St. John's Cathedral is "more to the east and north compared to Lady Bird
        Lake" - indicating a difference in position, not equality. The model explicitly

        north-south difference between them," it does not explicitly state they are
        at exactly the same latitude or position. The model's reasoning suggests more
        that the difference is minimal rather than that they are exactly equal. Since
        any difference, even if described as insignificant, means they're not exactly
        equal, this does not qualify as a NO due to equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because

        locations are different, with Tower 49 being on 49th Street and the Lyric
        Theatre on 43rd Street. The NO answer was given because their relative positions
        contradict the premise of the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        exactly the same position or that equality is the reason for the NO answer.
        Instead, it gives a different reasoning - that since both are in the downtown
        area (which it describes as the southern part of the city), the church is
        not south of the performing arts center. The model indicates they are "in
        close proximity" but does not claim they are at the same location.

        Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, noting that
        "the Tennessee Performing Arts Center is also in downtown Nashville, but it's
        slightly to the northwest of the church." This difference in position, even
        though described as "slight," means the NO answer was not due to equal values.

        equal or the same. Instead, it describes them as being "in the same general
        vicinity" and "relatively close to each other," but uses this proximity to
        conclude that one is not "significantly south" of the other. This indicates
        a judgment about relative position rather than exact equality.

        Nashville and close to each other, it does not explicitly state they are at
        the same location or have equal coordinates. The NO answer appears to be given
        because of uncertainty about their relative positions ("it's not clear if

        location, indicating there is a directional difference. The model mentions
        that Nevada is "not significantly north or south compared to Maryland" but

        relationship rather than a comparative result, as evidenced by the conclusion
        stating "we can't definitively say if Sandals Church is located south of St.

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Addicks Reservoir is "more
        to the south and east" compared to Canyon Lake. The NO answer is given because
        of this directional difference, not because of equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on the geographic relationship
        between the states, explaining that Minnesota is east of Washington. The NO
        is based on directional differences, not equality of values.

        is "not significantly south" and is "generally to the east" of San Dimas,
        implying there are positional differences, even if slight. The NO answer is
        based on the direction of difference (not being significantly south) rather
        than equality.

        in fact, it explicitly notes differences in position, stating San Dimas is
        "generally west of San Bernardino" and San Bernardino is "more to the east
        and slightly south." The NO answer is based on directional differences, not
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        San Bernardino is east of San Dimas (indicating different positions). The
        model's NO is based on relative positioning, not equality.

        for the NO answer. In fact, it notes that it's "challenging to definitively

        the model discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that the answer is "UNDETERMINED"
        and indicates it cannot determine the relative positions due to lack of specific

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "UNCERTAIN" and explicitly
