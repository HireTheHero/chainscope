      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it gave a directional reason - that Ohio is east of
        Iowa and therefore a location in Ohio is unlikely to be south of a location
        in Iowa. The answer indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this was a direct comparative conclusion based on the geographical
        analysis provided.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions or coordinates. Instead, it appears to contradict its own
        reasoning - it states Ohio is north of Iowa but then concludes NO without
        explaining why. Since equality is not mentioned as the reason for the NO answer,
        this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparison being made
        about relative positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it gives a directional explanation that California
        is "generally north of Arkansas" as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is
        based on a directional difference, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being at equal latitudes. Instead, it suggests there may be a slight difference
        in latitude ("may have a slightly more southerly latitude") but argues that
        the east-west difference makes the north-south comparison less relevant. The
        NO is based on this relevance argument, not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether DeGray Lake is south of Lake Arrowhead. While it discusses

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the locations are "at roughly
        the same latitude," this is not given as the reason for the NO answer. Instead,
        the NO is because Sarasota is east of Lake Casa Blanca while at roughly the
        same latitude, making it impossible to be south of it. The equality of latitude
        is part of the reasoning but not the primary reason for the NO answer.

        about relative positions and reaches NO as its conclusion without mentioning
        equality as a reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Brick Presbyterian Church
        is north of 257 Central Park West (at 91st vs 86th Street). The NO answer
        appears to be based on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        equal/same - it actually identified specific differences in their locations
        (one on Park Avenue at 91st St, the other on Central Park West at 86th St).
        The NO answer appears to be based on these positional differences.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations and their relative positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a difference
        in location (92nd Street vs 86th Street), explicitly stating that one location
        is "further north" than the other. It does not indicate the locations are
        equal or the same - in fact, it specifically identifies a difference in their
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations, making this a definitive NO response
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states there is a difference in position
        (91st St is north of 86th St) and uses this difference as the reason for its
        NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Brick Presbyterian Church (at 91st St) is north of

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are at different positions (one being further north than the other),
        not because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Brick
        Presbyterian Church is "further north" and "must be north of" the other location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Brick Presbyterian Church must be north of 257 Central Park West (not
        south of it). This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        the same. Instead, it described specific differences in location, noting that
        one is "further north" and that the streets run "parallel, with Central Park
        West being further west." The NO answer appears to be based on incorrect reasoning
        rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that Brick Presbyterian
        Church is north of 257 Central Park West, indicating a difference in location
        (91st street vs 85th/86th street). The NO appears to be a direct response
        to the original comparison question rather than indicating equality.

        that the east/west difference makes the north/south positioning "largely irrelevant".
        This is not the same as stating they are at equal positions. The NO answer
        appears to be based on the irrelevance of the north/south positioning rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Betts House is south of Glenn Cunningham Lake. While the

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer, but not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it gave NO because it believed
        Idaho is north of Washington (though this is factually incorrect). The model
        indicated a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions - instead, it explicitly notes differences in their locations
        (East Coast vs West Coast, with California being "significantly west and generally
        south of Virginia"). The NO answer appears to be because the model's conclusion
        contradicts the implied premise (that Claytor Dam is south of O'Neill Forebay).

        stating that western NC (where Lake Tahoma is) is "generally considered to
        be above (north of)" central/eastern NC (where Duke Energy Center is). Since
        it indicates a directional difference rather than equality as the reason for
        its NO answer, this should be classified as False.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal or the same. In fact, through its reasoning steps, it implied there
        was a difference (western vs eastern states) and made a directional claim
        about western states being "generally south of" eastern states. The NO answer
        appears to be based on this directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out its reasoning steps. This was a clear NO response,
        not a refusal or inability to determine.

        the same latitude or otherwise equal in position. Instead, it indicates that
        Cheney Reservoir is northwest of Toronto Lake, meaning there is a directional
        difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - in fact, it noted that Minnesota is south of Maine, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify
        the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are at equal latitudes. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined Lewiston,
        ME is north of Rochester, MN (indicating different latitudes). The model explicitly
        states Maine is "considerably north of Minnesota."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, directly addressing the comparative question about whether Rochester
        is south of Lewiston.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (west vs south), not on equality of values. It explicitly states that one
        location is west of the other, indicating a difference in position rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this
        conclusion (west, not south).

        (Indiana being east of Iowa), not because the locations are at the same position.
        The model explicitly states there is a difference in position and uses this
        difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing reasoning about relative positions. This is a direct comparative
        answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it gave a directional reason - that Indiana
        is east of Iowa and therefore something in Indiana cannot be south of something
        in Iowa.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's based on the reasoning that Indiana
        is east of Iowa and therefore something in Indiana cannot be south of something
        in Iowa. The model is making a directional comparison and finding a difference,
        not an equality.

        it indicates a difference in position (not equality) as the reason for the
        NO answer, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after providing its comparative analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        the same position. Instead, it indicated that Cadle Tabernacle is "slightly
        to the northwest of the downtown core" where BMO Plaza is located, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that BMO Plaza is not south of Cadle Tabernacle. This is a clear comparative
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position - in fact, it explicitly notes that BMO Plaza is downtown
        while Cadle Tabernacle is "slightly south of downtown" and concludes that
        "BMO Plaza is north of Cadle Tabernacle". The NO answer appears to be in response
        to some unstated comparison, but is definitely not due to the locations being
        equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after providing its comparative analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    de3e04b0-4149-43b8-b603-e4b5ac961ea1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in position, stating
        that BMO Plaza is downtown while Cadle Tabernacle is "slightly south of downtown"
        and concludes that "BMO Plaza is north of Cadle Tabernacle." Since it identifies
        a directional difference, even though described as "slightly," this cannot
        be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after providing its comparative analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    efff1048-7a83-4dd7-9b94-1d0585da7c8f:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in position,
        stating that "Cadle Tabernacle is slightly north of downtown" while "BMO Plaza
        is downtown." The NO answer appears to be because the model's conclusion ("BMO
        Plaza is *north* of Cadle Tabernacle") was incorrect, not because the locations
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparison question, and this appears to be a direct comparative result
        rather than a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        latitude or are at the same north/south position. Instead, it explained that
        Indiana is directly east of Iowa, making a south comparison impossible. The
        NO answer was based on relative positioning, not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that one location is not south of the other.
        This is a clear negative comparative result.

        being equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines the
        Cathedral is likely north of the Basilica, indicating a difference in positions.
        The reasoning involves relative state positions and directional differences.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making a clear comparative judgment about their
        relative positions.

        equal - it actually concluded that one location was north of the other. The
        NO appears to be answering whether one location was south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

        of the relationship due to the relative positions of the states. The model
        argued that Indiana is east of Iowa, making a south relationship impossible.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

        the other based on their NW vs SW addresses. The NO answer was based on this
        difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after explaining
        that Charles E. Nelson House is further south than Mission Theater and Pub
        based on their addresses (NW vs SW)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that one location is north of the other (Portland being north of Salem), not
        because the locations are at equal positions. It explicitly states a difference
        in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final comparative conclusion, based on finding that one location is north
        of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d5cd35d4-15ad-4385-bf1c-f953594ac64b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that Portland is further north than Salem, indicating
        a difference in latitude. The NO answer is given because one location is actually
        north of the other, not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with no caveats about inability to verify or determine. The
        answer is given as a direct comparative result based on the locations' relative
        positions.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model actually
        found differences in location (west vs central/east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly noted that they are in different positions,
        with Town Hall Seattle being northwest of Banks Lake. The NO answer was based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences
        (Banks Lake being east of Seattle, not allowing for a south relationship),
        not because the locations are at the same coordinates. The model explicitly
        notes they are in different locations with Banks Lake being "significantly
        east of Seattle."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a directional reasoning for why one location is not south of
        the other, making this a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it actually specified differences, stating that Banks Lake is east
        of Seattle and slightly north. The NO answer appears to be based on these
        directional differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, determining that Banks

        is). The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, making this a clear NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal - the model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (west and slightly north). The NO appears to be in response to the original
        comparison question, not due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing a directional analysis that concludes Town Hall Seattle is
        west and slightly north of Banks Lake.

    cbcc6d71-ff6e-4d6a-813d-65403e4d2921:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined Town
        Hall Seattle is "significantly further north" than Banks Lake - indicating
        a clear difference in latitude rather than equal values. The NO was based
        on this difference, not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Town Hall Seattle is further north than Banks Lake, making a clear comparative
        judgment.

        or the same - instead, it noted they were in different parts of Washington
        (Eastern vs Western) and concluded "West is not South". The NO answer was
        based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it actually described a specific
        directional relationship (Queen Anne Hotel being north of Belden Place), making
        its "NO" answer somewhat contradictory to its analysis, but we must evaluate
        based on what was explicitly stated rather than resolve contradictions.

        roughly the same latitude" (31.5 degrees North), this is not given as the
        reason for the NO answer. Instead, the model concludes NO because Natchez
        is east of Waco at the same latitude, making it impossible for Natchez to
        be south of Waco.

        something from being directly south, suggesting a directional difference rather
        than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparison being evaluated
        (whether one location is south of the other). The NO is not qualified with

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position. Instead, it gives a directional difference, stating "Turtle
        Creek is generally north of White Rock Lake" as the basis for its NO answer.
        The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        or the same. Instead, it indicates a directional difference, stating "Turtle
        Creek is generally north of White Rock Lake." Even though this is the basis
        for the NO answer, it represents a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly noted that one location is west of the other with several
        miles distance between them ("Kalita Humphreys Theater is on the west side...
        and White Rock Lake is several miles to the east/northeast").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it states that Turtle Creek (where the theater
        is) is "generally north of White Rock Lake" - indicating a difference in position,
        not equality. This directional difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer in step 4, and this is a clear directional comparison without any caveats

        equal positions. Instead, it states that "Turtle Creek is generally north
        of where White Rock Lake is situated" and uses this directional difference
        to conclude NO. Since it indicates a directional difference rather than equality,
        this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on the relative positions it
        analyzed.

        or the same - instead, it explicitly notes a directional difference, stating
        "Turtle Creek is generally north of White Rock Lake". Even though this is
        the basis for the NO answer, it indicates a difference in position rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making this a clear NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal/same
        - instead, it stated that Turtle Creek is "generally north of and/or west
        of White Rock Lake, not south of it." The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "YES" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitude. Instead, it explicitly states that San Antonio is "significantly
        further north" than north-central Florida. This difference in latitude is
        the reason given for the NO answer, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, both in the explanation ("is NOT south of") and
        in the bold "NO" conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it explicitly noted differences, stating San Antonio is "significantly
        west and slightly south" of central Florida. The NO answer was based on the
        fact that the significant longitudinal difference makes the "south of" directional
        comparison not applicable, not because the locations were at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the geographical positions. This was a clear comparative
        result, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    abb12453-e30a-4ec7-8e64-740085ac96c8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it indicates that San Antonio is "west, and perhaps
        slightly south" of Rodman Reservoir. The NO answer appears to be given because
        the locations have different positions, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after providing reasoning about the relative positions of the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates that San Antonio is NORTH of
        Rodman Reservoir, showing a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b9fefde6-9ad0-4b40-9ce4-347f5eaf3cbd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after providing its reasoning steps.

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly stated that San Antonio is "significantly
        north" of North Central Florida. This difference in position was the reason
        for the NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, without any caveats about
        inability to determine or verify.

    c66b3386-f9ac-4418-9bcd-53b1e455f648:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's because San Antonio is described as
        being "west and slightly south" rather than directly south. The model explicitly
        notes there is a directional difference (both westward and southward components).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, providing clear reasoning about why San Antonio
        is not directly south of Rodman Reservoir (because it is west and slightly
        south, rather than directly south).

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or at the same latitude. Instead, it explained that Texas extends further
        north than Florida and concluded NO based on the relative geographical positions
        being different, with Texas being "generally further north and west."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that one location
        is not south of the other.

    fb776b48-24de-4d60-8984-5dd2edae3ccf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that while San Antonio is west
        and slightly south of Rodman Reservoir, this positioning does not make it
        "south" of the reference point. The NO is based on directional differences,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and provides reasoning leading to that conclusion based on directional
        analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly determined that one location is north of the
        other based on their street locations within Philadelphia. The NO appears
        to be in response to whether one location is south of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        Maryland is "significantly north of Nevada" - indicating a clear difference
        in position, not equality. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning about relative positions
        (East Coast vs West Coast) and indicates there is a directional difference
        due to the curvature of the earth. Since it notes a difference rather than
        equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out its reasoning steps. This is a clear NO answer without

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on geographical differences
        (Maryland being east of Nevada), not on the values being equal. The model
        explicitly notes directional differences, stating that Maryland locations
        would be "north and east" of Nevada locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because Riverside is "primarily
        east" of Los Angeles, with only a slight southerly component, making it not
        "strictly south". The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations. This is a clear
        comparative result, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates there is a directional difference,
        noting that Riverside is east of Los Angeles (with a "slight" southern component).
        Even though the southern component is described as "slight," any stated difference
        means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, and this appears to be a direct comparative result
        rather than a refusal or inability to determine.

        while there is a southerly component, it's "primarily east" and doesn't meet
        the criteria of being predominantly southward.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that while there is a southerly
        component, Riverside is "primarily east" of Los Angeles, which indicates a
        difference in position. The NO is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the locations. This is a clear comparative

    090dea8f-7f65-4e3c-9f76-fe6ac35e53d7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it determines NO based on finding that Chicago is north
        of Wheaton, indicating a directional difference between the locations. Since
        there is a stated difference in position (not equality), this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its analysis of the locations,
        not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal - it explicitly states that Chicago is "generally
        north of Wheaton", indicating a directional difference
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and "NOT south of" as
        its comparative conclusion

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - instead, it explicitly notes a directional difference, stating that "Chicago
        is generally north of Wheaton." This difference, not equality, is the basis
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - instead, it explicitly notes a directional difference, stating that "Chicago
        is generally north of Wheaton." The NO answer appears to be based on this
        directional difference rather than equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Chicago is north of Wheaton and concludes
        that Moody Church is north of Wheaton Bible Church. The NO answer appears
        to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after walking through its reasoning about the relative positions
        of the churches.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Chicago being north of Wheaton), not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference, so
        this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative answer based on its reasoning that Chicago (where Moody Church
        is) is north of Wheaton (where Wheaton Bible Church is).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as its reasoning,
        stating that "Chicago is north of Wheaton, IL" to justify its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        to support this conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it gives a directional difference,
        stating that "Chicago is generally north of Wheaton" as the reason for its
        NO answer. Since it indicates a directional difference rather than equality,
        this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that Moody Church is not south of Wheaton
        Bible Church. This is a direct NO answer to the comparison.
