      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states they
        are in different positions (Lake Martin is northeast of Dal-Tex Building)
        and uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.

        answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know" and explains
        that it cannot make a determination due to lack of location data. It specifically
        avoids giving a YES/NO answer, indicating it is refusing to make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it bases its answer on the
        different geographic positions of the states and concludes that "the clinic
        would not be south of the lake." The reason for NO is directional difference,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        locations were at equal coordinates - it stated it couldn't determine their
        relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the relationship ("cannot
        confidently state whether", "do not have enough precise information"). This
        makes it clear the model is saying NO because it cannot determine the relationship,
        not as a comparative result.

        far apart" and bases its NO answer on the reasoning that a Virginia facility
        would likely not be south of a Kentucky lake. The NO is based on relative
        position differences, not equality.

        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that one location
        is east of the other, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was
        based on directional difference (east vs south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        indicating that Beaver Valley is north of the Basilica (opposite to what was
        asked). The NO is based on this directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (nuclear station being
        NORTH of the basilica), which is a clear difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states they are different,
        with the power station being "north of the basilica". The NO is based on the
        direction being opposite to what was asked (north instead of south).

        is a different reason than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it explains that the comparison cannot be meaningfully

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference - Lake Tahoma is west and north of the Duke Energy Center, not
        south of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Lake Tahoma is not south of the Duke Energy Center,
        but rather west and north of it.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined Lake Tahoma is specifically NORTH of the Duke Energy
        Center, indicating a difference in position. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical
        analysis that Lake Tahoma is NORTH of the Duke Energy Center, not south.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Lake
        Tahoma is north of the Duke Energy Center, not because the locations are at
        the same position. The model explicitly states a directional difference between
        the locations, so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states the locations are different, with Lake Tahoma being
        west of the Duke Energy Center. The NO is because the relationship is different
        (west rather than south), not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Lake Galena was determined to be north of McCarter Theatre, which contradicted
        the premise being asked about (whether it was south). The model explicitly
        states "Lake Galena appears to be north of McCarter Theatre."

        in fact, it explicitly states "Lake Galena is slightly south of McCarter Theatre"
        indicating a difference in position, even if small. The NO answer appears
        to be because the premise was incorrect (Lake Galena being south), not because
        the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Lake Galena is NOT
        located south of McCarter Theatre" as its final answer. This is a clear NO
        comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model claimed Lake Galena is north of McCarter Theatre, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 5 and again as the final standalone answer. The model makes
        a clear comparative directional claim that Lake Galena is north of McCarter
        Theatre, leading to its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Lake Galena is north of McCarter Theatre, not south), not because
        the locations are equal. The model explicitly notes a difference in position
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify
        the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        Lake Galena is northwest of McCarter Theatre, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's based on their being "quite far apart"
        and in different states. The model explicitly notes differences in location
        (Arizona being west of Texas) and uses this geographic separation as the basis
        for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with a clear "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, despite expressing some uncertainty in its reasoning.
        While it mentions not being "100% certain," it still provides a definitive
        NO based on "geographic reasoning."

        never reached a NO conclusion, so the question of equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains it lacks precise information to make the determination.
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their
        relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (with the caveat that this is
        based on limited information)" but also explicitly says "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and "I do not have enough certainty to answer." This indicates
        the model cannot make the determination, making this an UNKNOWN response despite
        the "NO" at the end.

        the locations were equal - it actually stated they were in different states
        and regions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" near the end, it heavily
        qualifies this by saying it "cannot give a definitive YES or NO answer" and
        emphasizes this is "not a high-confidence answer due to insufficient precise
        location data." The model is effectively indicating it cannot determine the

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the geographic relationship
        between Arizona and Texas (with Arizona being west and north of Texas), not
        because the locations are at the same coordinates or have equal values. The
        model explicitly notes they are in "different parts" of the southwestern US.

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains that it lacks precise coordinates to make the
        determination. This indicates it cannot make the comparison rather than refusing
        to answer or giving a clear YES/NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states Gibraltar Dam is northwest
        of Lake Palmdale, indicating different positions. The NO answer was given
        because Gibraltar Dam was determined to be northwest (not south) of Lake Palmdale.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical comparison

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - it explicitly states that Gibraltar Dam is west/southwest
        of Lake Palmdale, indicating different positions. The NO is because the direction
        is different (west/southwest) rather than south, not because the locations
        are the same
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, and this NO is given as a clear comparative result (indicating
        Gibraltar Dam is not south of Lake Palmdale, but rather west/southwest)'

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Gibraltar Dam was explicitly stated to be west of Lake Palmdale, indicating
        a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because
        the model determined Gibraltar Dam is north of Lake Palmdale, indicating a
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical comparison finding

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Gibraltar Dam is northwest of Lake Palmdale). The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a directional explanation that Gibraltar Dam is northwest of Lake

        Dam is northwest of Lake Palmdale, indicating a directional difference. It
        does not state that the locations are equal or the same in any way. The NO
        is due to a directional difference, not due to equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating Gibraltar Dam is north/northwest of Lake Palmdale), not because the
        locations are at the same position. The model explicitly notes a difference
        in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The NO was given because Gibraltar
        Dam was explicitly stated to be "northwest of Lake Palmdale" and "much further
        west and northwest", indicating a clear directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is north of the other, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states "Goodspeed Musicals is NORTH, not south, of the church" as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, based on its determination that Goodspeed Musicals is north
        of (not south of) the church.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Goodspeed Musicals is north of the church, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        positions. The model determined that Goodspeed Musicals is north of the church,
        not south, leading to a definitive NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Goodspeed
        Musicals is northeast of Saint Sava Serbian Orthodox Church, indicating a
        clear directional difference between their locations. The NO answer was based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical comparison
        showing one location is northeast of the other.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found the locations
        were in different positions (one north, one south), not because they were
        equal/same/identical. It explicitly states Goodspeed Musicals is NORTH of
        the church.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Goodspeed Musicals is north of the church (opposite
        of what was asked in the question about being south)
      final_answer: 'NO'

    b0b86bda-b7c3-4940-aa3c-ecb818c068b3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        that Goodspeed Musicals is NORTH of Saint Sava Serbian Orthodox Church, not
        because the locations are at the same position. It explicitly states there
        is a difference in position ("Connecticut is further north than Indiana").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response about
        the relative positioning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c486f6e2-8061-489b-bd32-9097cfebf515:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is east of the other, not because the locations are at the same latitude.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Connecticut
        is east of Indiana, not south"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographic comparison showing Connecticut
        is east, not south, of Indiana.'

    c9e2ced2-021f-4293-abde-d09688569be3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Goodspeed
        Musicals is NORTH of the church, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer was given because the relationship was
        opposite to what was asked (north instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that Goodspeed Musicals is north of the church,
        not south as asked in the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        never reached a NO conclusion based on equal values - it instead indicated
        it couldn't make the comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO to this question" and explains that one location is unverifiable,
        making comparison impossible. This is a case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the comparison.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        equality comparisons.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" because it cannot verify the location of one of the places
        being compared. This indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't verify one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and indicates it cannot make the comparison because
        it cannot verify one of the locations. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria
        as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model says "NO", it immediately clarifies
        that this NO means it "cannot conclusively say" and cites "insufficient precise
        location information" as the reason. This makes it clear that the model is
        actually indicating an inability to determine the relationship, not a negative

        that Ohio is at a lower latitude than Colorado, indicating a difference in
        positions. The NO answer was given because the model determined Ohio is actually
        further south than Colorado, not because the locations were at the same latitude.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences
        (Michigan being north of Oregon), not because the locations are at equal positions.
        The model explicitly states there is a difference in position, with Michigan
        being north of Oregon.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, making a definitive comparative judgment based on geographical
        analysis.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative positions
        (Michigan being northeast of Oregon), not because the locations are at the
        same position. The model explicitly notes differences in location, stating
        one is east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear reasoning path leading to that conclusion
        based on geographical positions.

      result: 'NO'
    8edd45a9-ed2f-47c2-b445-3544be62a853:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were at equal positions. Instead, it gave a directional
        difference as its reasoning, stating that "Michigan is east of Oregon" and
        therefore the theatre is NOT south of the lake. The NO was based on relative
        positioning, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in step 5 and as the final "Answer: NO". This NO is given
        as a direct comparative result, not as an inability to determine or verify.'

    abd445e1-7af9-4dd1-99b1-6e04937b9870:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (Farmington being NORTH of Fourmile Lake), not because the locations are at
        equal positions. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations, so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer in step 6, making a direct comparative judgment about the geographical
        relationship between the two locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states the locations are in different parts of the US (east
        vs west) and gives directional differences as the reason for the NO answer.
        The NO is because one location is east of the other, not because they are
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment based on geographical
        positions.'

    b2f2eef1-2b43-4bdc-a8d8-2aaea4ac42c1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is north of the other, not because the locations are at the same
        latitude. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Farmington
        Civic Theatre is actually north of Fourmile Lake").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Farmington Civic Theatre is north of (not south of)
        Fourmile Lake. This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bccdbc96-45db-42db-9f0f-20ceaed4fac7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its answer, it does not
        state that the locations are at equal latitudes. Instead, it bases its NO
        answer on the east-west relationship between Michigan and Oregon. The model
        does not mention equality of values as a reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify. The NO is given as a direct answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (one is north of the other). The NO is based on the direction being
        opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (that Farmington
        Civic Theatre is north of Fourmile Lake, not south)
      final_answer: 'NO'

        never claimed the locations were equal - it actually stated they were in different
        states.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but rejects the premises by noting that BMO Plaza is in Chicago (not Indiana)
        and that Cadle Tabernacle no longer exists. When a model rejects the premises
        of the question, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        of any equality comparisons.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and rejects the premise of the question since one location is
        not in Indiana. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model rejects
        the premises of the question.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing values as equal or different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and indicates it lacks reliable data to make
        the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot determine

        values consideration only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and rejects the premise since one location is not in Indiana

        the comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and explains that it cannot determine the relationship due to
        incorrect premises (one location not being in Indiana as stated). This is
        a case where the model rejects the premises and indicates it cannot make the
        comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot make the comparison
        due to incorrect premises (BMO Plaza not being in Indiana), but then provides
        "NO" only because it feels compelled to give a YES/NO answer. This rejection
        of premises makes this an UNKNOWN classification.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO to this question" because it lacks reliable geographic data
        to make the comparison. This indicates an inability to determine the answer
        rather than a refusal to compare or rejection of premises.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Boulder City is west of Durham). The NO is because the direction
        is different from what was asked (west instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, based on its reasoning that Boulder City is west
        of Durham, not south of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that Boulder City would
        be NORTH of Durham, indicating a clear directional difference. The NO is given
        because the direction is opposite to what was asked (south), not because the
        locations are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify. The NO is given as a direct answer to the comparative question
        about relative position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that Boulder City is
        "significantly west of Durham" and bases its NO answer on the fact that the
        relationship is westward rather than southward. The model identifies a clear
        directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparative analysis of the

        (Boulder City being north of Durham), not because the locations are at the
        same latitude. The model explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        with one being north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, based on its geographic analysis showing
        that Boulder City is north of Durham, not south.

        locations are equal. The model explicitly states that Boulder City is "further
        west and at a higher latitude than Durham" - indicating a clear difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on Boulder City being at a higher latitude,
        not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, with no caveats about inability to determine

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this is because it "cannot confirm the location relationship." This is

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a directional comparison (Addicks Reservoir is north
        of Canyon Lake, not south) as justification.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b1649a95-2db9-4960-9c74-0f38cffaedc7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that "Addicks Reservoir is further north than Canyon
        Lake" and is "further north and east compared to Canyon Lake", indicating
        a difference in position. The NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparative analysis showing Addicks
        Reservoir is further north than Canyon Lake.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Addicks being southeast rather than south of Canyon Lake), not
        because the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly notes
        they are in different positions relative to San Antonio.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (Addicks Reservoir being east/southeast of Canyon Lake), not on the locations
        being equal or the same. It explicitly notes a directional difference as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with directional reasoning leading to that conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that Addicks Reservoir is southeast of Canyon Lake,
        indicating different positions. The NO is given because Addicks Reservoir
        is southeast rather than directly south of Canyon Lake.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, and this NO is given as a direct comparative
        result based on its geographic analysis.

        - it explicitly states that the locations are "quite far apart" and that Minnesota
        is "east/southeast of Washington state". The NO is based on the fact that
        the relative positioning is different from what was asked (east/southeast
        rather than south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states San Bernardino
        is east/northeast of San Dimas, indicating different positions. The NO is
        based on directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        one location was explicitly stated to be east of the other, establishing a
        different directional relationship than the one being asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its directional analysis
        that one location is east of the other, not south.'
