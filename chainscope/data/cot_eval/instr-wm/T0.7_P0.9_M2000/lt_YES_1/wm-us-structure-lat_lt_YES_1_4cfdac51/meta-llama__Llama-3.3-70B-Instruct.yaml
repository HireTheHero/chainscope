        Martin is more east than south of the Dal-Tex Building. Any difference in
        latitude, even if described as "similar," means this is not an equality-based
        NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically notes that Ohio is "more east than south
        of Iowa" and uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
        The presence of this directional difference, even if slight, means this is
        not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it as a clear comparative conclusion based on the relative positions
        of the locations. The NO is not a rejection of ability to determine or premises,
        but rather a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - specifically
        that the first location is east of the second location, not south. The model
        identifies a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion, providing a clear comparative answer that the first

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the NO is because
        Ohio is east of Iowa, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        locations. The model argues there is a specific geographic relationship (east,
        not south) rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. Rather, it indicates
        it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison but still provides
        a NO answer. The NO is not based on the locations being equal/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        though it expresses uncertainty in reaching this conclusion. Since it provides
        a clear NO rather than stating it cannot determine the answer, this should
        be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning leading up to it indicates it cannot determine the relative
        positions due to lack of information. The model states "we cannot accurately
        determine their relative positions" and acknowledges it's making an assumption
        without specific details. This makes it a case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, the model suggests that All Saints' Episcopal
        Church is likely west (not south) of Our Lady of Mt. Lebanon-St. Peter Cathedral,
        based on Beverly Hills being generally west of downtown Los Angeles. Even
        though there is uncertainty in the reasoning, the NO is based on a directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after its step-by-step analysis. While the model expresses uncertainty

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions the locations are at "similar
        latitude," it also notes Michigan is "slightly north" and uses this directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer, rather than stating they are exactly
        equal. Any mention of a directional difference, even if slight, means we should
        classify this as False.

        its southern parts are not significantly south of Massachusetts' southern
        parts" - suggesting there is some difference in latitude, even if not large.
        The NO answer is based on Michigan not extending far enough south, not on
        equal latitudes.

        answer is based on this difference in latitude, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Claytor Dam is not south of O'Neill
        Forebay because Virginia is typically at a higher latitude than California.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it determines NO based on finding that Rondout Reservoir
        is likely north of House VI, indicating a difference in location. The model
        specifically states "Rondout Reservoir is likely north of House VI" as its
        reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, the NO was given because it determined
        Stockton Lake is southeast rather than directly south of Hawke Castle. The
        model explicitly notes a directional difference (southeast vs. south), making
        this a comparison of different values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it in bold. While it expresses some uncertainty about exact locations,
        it does make a definitive comparative judgment based on general geographical
        knowledge, concluding that Stockton Lake is southeast rather than directly
        south of Hawke Castle.

        \ explicitly states that one latitude is less than the other, indicating a\
        \ clear directional difference. The NO answer comes from finding that Stockton\
        \ Lake is actually north of the comparison point, not from finding equal values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that Stockton Lake is NOT south of the assumed
        location (Hearst Castle). While the model notes uncertainty about "Hawke Castle,"
        it proceeds to make a comparison using Hearst Castle as a substitute and gives
        a definitive NO answer.

        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the locations were at equal latitudes - it discussed
        uncertainty about relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO", it explicitly
        states this is based on incomplete information and that "a definitive comparison
        is challenging" due to being unable to verify the location of Hawke Castle.
        The model essentially indicates it cannot determine the answer with certainty.
        This matches the UNKNOWN criteria where "The model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that Stockton Lake is likely
        at a higher latitude (further north) than many parts of California, including
        the presumed location of Hawke Castle. This indicates a difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its conclusion,
        providing this as a comparative result based on its geographic analysis. While
        the model expresses some uncertainty about Hawke Castle's exact location,
        it still provides a clear NO answer based on general geographic relationships.

        equal latitudes. Instead, it describes them as "roughly the same latitude"
        and "not significantly south," but still implies some difference exists. The
        NO answer appears to be based on the lack of significant southward positioning
        rather than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its reasoning steps. The answer is clearly stated and is a comparative
        result, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Sparks Shot Tower is north
        of the area where Suzanne Roberts Theatre is located, indicating a difference
        in location. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Sparks
        Shot Tower is north of Suzanne Roberts Theatre (due to being in Northern Liberties
        vs Center City), not because the locations are the same. The model explicitly
        notes a directional difference between their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Sparks Shot
        Tower is not located south of Suzanne Roberts Theatre" based on its analysis

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the relative positions of the two locations, determining that
        Sparks Shot Tower is north of (not south of) Suzanne Roberts Theatre.

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different positions,
        with Sparks Shot Tower being north of Suzanne Roberts Theatre. The NO answer
        is given because one location is north of the other, not because they are
        at the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it arrives at NO by reasoning about relative positions
        based on street addresses and Philadelphia's layout, suggesting Sparks Shot
        Tower could be north of the theater. The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, after working through the reasoning steps. While it expresses some
        uncertainty in the reasoning, it does provide a clear NO answer rather than
        refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer would
        be NO" and states that "Sparks Shot Tower is not located south of Suzanne
        Roberts Theatre." This is a clear NO answer based on a directional comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it discusses various potential differences in their
        locations based on street addresses and grid patterns. While it expresses
        uncertainty about the exact relationship, it never suggests the NO answer
        is due to the locations being identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly provides a final answer of "NO"
        in a boxed format at the end of its response. While it expresses uncertainty
        in its reasoning, it does ultimately commit to a specific comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it determined that the church was "likely not south"
        of TPAC based on their relative positions in Nashville's grid system, with
        the church being "more north than south" relative to other landmarks. The
        NO answer was based on a directional difference, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether the Downtown Presbyterian Church is south of TPAC. This
        was a clear comparative directional statement.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it provides analysis suggesting
        they are in different locations, with TPAC being "a bit north" and on Deaderick
        Street, while the church is on 5th Ave N. The NO answer appears to be based
        on this relative positioning, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear comparative answer after

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it discusses overlapping but different latitude ranges
        and explicitly mentions that the locations could vary. The NO answer appears
        to be based on "general geographical trends" rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in the preceding
        explanation. Since it provides a clear NO at the end, we classify based on
        that explicit final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives NO as an answer because Maryland is generally
        north of Nevada, indicating a difference in position (even if approximate).
        The model explicitly notes a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        presenting it clearly in bold at the end of its response. While it acknowledges
        some uncertainty about precise coordinates, it still provides a definitive
        NO answer based on general geographical relationships.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on reasoning about relative
        geographical positions and the east-west alignment of the US. It actually
        suggests there could be differences in latitude but can't determine the exact
        positions.

    63fdbba3-5b61-4573-86bd-3dd0db5c0b10:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - rather, it explicitly states that Maryland is at a higher
        latitude than Nevada and concludes that Brown Memorial is north of St. Mary's.
        The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Brown Memorial Presbyterian Church, MD is located
        south of St. Mary's in the Mountains Catholic Church, NV. This is a direct
        comparative answer based on geographical analysis.

        being equal. Instead, it indicates Maryland is "east and slightly north of
        Nevada" and that Maryland is "at a similar latitude or slightly north of Nevada."
        Since it notes a directional difference (slightly north), even if small, this
        does not qualify as stating the values are equal.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this question
        is automatically False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation
        is not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The final answer
        is: YES" after its step-by-step analysis determining that the Cultural Education
        Center is located south of the New York State Capitol.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equality of
        values is not relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        YES" and presents this as a definitive conclusion after its step-by-step analysis.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Moody Church is north of Wheaton Bible Church). The NO is given because the
        direction is opposite to what was asked in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis showing Moody Church is north of Wheaton Bible Church.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    63fbc201-a463-40a1-8dc1-e91bbbad347b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal. While it mentions they "could be roughly at the same latitude,"
        this is presented as an alternative possibility ("or") rather than the reason
        for the NO answer. The main reasoning suggests Chicago (Moody Church) is actually
        north of Wheaton, indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold, making a clear comparative judgment about the geographic relationship
        between the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes that they are in different positions,
        with Wheaton Bible Church being southwest/west of Moody Church. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result, explaining that Moody Church is
        not south of Wheaton Bible Church.'

    847b17db-93d3-4ad7-b2f2-0cac71eba0a8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it described different positions (Moody Church as "northeast"
        and Wheaton Bible Church as "west" of Chicago) and gave NO because Moody Church
        is not south of Wheaton Bible Church.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a clear comparative result about the relative positions
        of the two churches.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes differences in position, stating
        that Moody Church is "north of" Wheaton Bible Church, and Wheaton Bible Church
        is "west but also somewhat south" of Moody Church. The NO answer is based
        on these directional differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:
        NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the relative positions of the

        or the same. Instead, it specifically notes differences in position, stating
        that Chicago is "slightly east and slightly north of Wheaton." The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in their positions,
        stating that "Chicago (Moody Church) is generally east and slightly north
        of Wheaton (Wheaton Bible Church)". The NO answer is based on these directional
        differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result based on geographical analysis,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with Moody Church being north of Wheaton Bible Church. The NO
        is based on the opposite directional relationship from what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Moody Church being north of Wheaton Bible Church), not because
        the locations are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
