      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that one cathedral
        is north of the other (indicating a difference in location). The NO is because
        Our Lady of Lebanon is north of St. James, not because they're at the same
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Our Lady of Lebanon
        Maronite Cathedral is not located south of the Cathedral Basilica of St. James"

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (southwest
        vs south). The NO is because the direction is different from what was asked
        (southwest instead of directly south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result about the relative position, specifically

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (one being north of
        the other), making them explicitly unequal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        Lake, MO is not located south of Hawke Castle, CA." However, in its reasoning,
        it states it cannot determine the exact location of Hawke Castle and only
        makes estimates based on California's general latitude range. Since the model
        indicates it cannot determine the actual relative positions due to missing

        are at the same latitude. The model never states the locations are equal or
        the same - in fact, it suggests they are likely different, with one being
        north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it expressed some uncertainty in its reasoning.
        Since it gave a clear NO answer rather than stating it couldn't determine
        the relationship, this counts as a NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that one
        location is north of the other (Portland being in northern Oregon and Cottage
        Grove in southern Oregon), not because the locations are equal or the same.
        The model clearly indicates a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Mission Theater
        and Pub is not located south of the Charles E. Nelson House" as its final
        comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5938ed2d-64dc-47e7-938d-7319290d6591:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states they are in different locations (Portland
        vs Cottage Grove) and gives the reason for NO as the Mission Theater being
        north of the Nelson House. The values being compared (locations) are different,
        not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response based
        on its geographical analysis that the Mission Theater is north (not south)
        of the Nelson House.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bfd8a5a9-c0e5-478f-a1d9-a95863ea952e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that the locations are different, with the Mission
        Theater being north of the Nelson House. The NO is because the premise (being
        south of) is opposite to the actual relative positions the model identified.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making a definitive comparative judgment that
        the Mission Theater is not south of the Nelson House (because it's north of
        it).

    c5dd1ce3-1271-47ad-ba8a-0970ac5bd35f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is north of the other (Portland being north of Cottage Grove), not
        because the locations are at the same latitude. The model explicitly identifies
        a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether the Mission Theater is south of the Nelson House,
        providing a direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d1cbdd54-3cd6-4e94-bebb-23eb7ea4c8ea:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (one location being north of the other), not because the locations are at
        the same coordinates. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that the Mission Theater is north of (not south of) the Charles
        E. Nelson House.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e28901f5-d263-475a-b33f-0f6aa8ac427d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that the
        locations are different, with one being north of the other (Portland being
        north of Albany). The NO answer was given because the relationship is opposite
        to what was asked (theater is north, not south, of the house).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether the Mission Theater is south of the Nelson House.
        This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ef2f8595-7afc-45b2-9de6-7013ea21c268:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different positions, with one
        being north of the other. The NO answer is based on their different positions,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question is: NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations.'

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        AFI Silver was determined to be "east and slightly north" of Lake Monroe -
        indicating a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it gives a directional difference as its reason
        for NO, specifically that Minnesota is "east and slightly north of Washington"
        rather than south. Since it indicates a directional difference rather than
        equality as the reason for NO, this is False.

        not because they are at equal positions. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference.

        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model indicated there was
        a directional difference, stating that Minnesota locations would be "east
        and generally south" of Washington locations. Any stated directional difference,
        even if described as "generally," means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" as a clear comparative result, indicating that the Star Lite
        Motel is not south of Lake Steilacoom (in fact, stating it would be "east

        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the model's reasoning indicates
        the NO is because Minnesota is "east and not specifically south of Washington."
        The model identifies a directional difference (east vs west) as the basis
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step reasoning, making this a definitive NO

        difference, specifically that Minnesota is "to the northeast of Washington."
        Any directional difference, even if described as slight, means this is not
        an equality-based NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - instead, it explicitly states there is a difference, saying
        the motel is "north of Lake Steilacoom." The NO is because the relationship
        is opposite to what was asked (north rather than south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the Star Lite Motel is south of Lake Steilacoom, providing a direct

        equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly states that Minnesota is "at a higher
        latitude (further north) compared to Washington" - indicating a difference
        in position, not equality. The NO answer is based on Minnesota being further
        north, not on the locations being at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Star
        Lite Motel, MN is not located south of Lake Steilacoom, WA" as its final answer.

        (Minnesota being "further north" than Washington state), not on the locations
        being equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, with Minnesota being at a higher latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with clear directional reasoning about relative positions. While it

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same
        - instead it explicitly states Trinity Dam is southeast of Carson Mansion
        (which is a directional difference). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the NO was given because Trinity Dam

        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Moody Church is
        "east and slightly north of Wheaton Bible Church," indicating a difference
        in location. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Moody Church is not

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - rather, it was because Moody Church was determined
        to be north of Wheaton Bible Church. The model explicitly states there is
        a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Thus, the answer is NO"
        as its final conclusion, based on finding that Moody Church is north (not
        south) of Wheaton Bible Church.

        locations are different - specifically that Moody Church is north of Wheaton
        Bible Church. It did not state the locations were equal or the same, but rather
        identified a directional difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Moody Church is north of Wheaton Bible Church (opposite
