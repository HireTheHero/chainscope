      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "Chicago is located to the
        south and slightly east of Sheboygan, WI, meaning The Ort Institute is likely
        not west of Sheboygan." The model is indicating a directional difference (south
        and slightly east), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final answer: NO" at
        the end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment that The Ort
        Institute is not west of the University of Wisconsin-Sheboygan.'

        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The answer is bolded and presented as the conclusion

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "The Ort Institute (if in
        Chicago or nearby) is not west of Sheboygan, WI." The model suggests that
        if the Ort Institute is in northeastern Illinois (Chicago area), it would
        likely be "east or nearly the same longitude as Sheboygan" - but this is presented
        as reasoning, not as the final conclusion. The final conclusion is simply
        that one is not west of the other, without explicitly stating they are equal.

    c434af33-9756-4dae-813a-261717833f95:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it states that "Chicago is actually slightly
        east of Sheboygan" - indicating a directional difference (east vs. west) as
        the reason for the NO answer. The model is noting a difference in values (slightly
        east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion to the comparative question. This is a clear negative
        response to whatever comparison was being asked.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Meadows School of the Arts
        is part of SMU and located within the SMU campus, making the comparison of
        being "west of" not meaningful. The reason for the NO is not that the locations
        are identical or equal, but that the relationship between them (one being
        contained within the other) makes the directional comparison inappropriate.

        SMU's campus" and therefore "it is not located west of SMU." The model is
        indicating a specific directional relationship (east vs. west) rather than

        significantly west of Ralston College; instead, it is more southward." This
        indicates a directional difference (southward rather than westward) as the
        reason for the NO answer, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clear and direct, with no qualifications
        that would make it an UNKNOWN or REFUSED response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that South University is east of Ralston College,
        and Ralston College is west of South University, indicating a directional
        difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.

        not NO, this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about
        equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "I cannot confidently answer YES
        or NO without more precise location data." The model does not provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer, but rather indicates it lacks sufficient information to
        make the comparison. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model clearly
        states it cannot determine the relative positions.

        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it states that "there is no significant
        westward difference that can be clearly established." This indicates uncertainty
        about relative positioning rather than equality. The model acknowledges they
        are in the same city but does not claim their exact locations are identical.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Franklin College is a part
        of UGA and is located within the UGA campus. The reason for the NO answer
        is that UGA "encompasses" Franklin College rather than being "distinctly west"
        of it. This is not stating equality but rather explaining a containment relationship.

        in Inglewood (east of CCH) and one in Chatsworth (west of CCH). The model
        concludes NO because it considers the main campus in Inglewood, which is not
        west of Columbia College Hollywood. This is a directional difference, not
        an equality.

        comparing different campuses, noting that "East Grand Forks campus with M
        State's Moorhead campus, they are roughly aligned in longitude" and "Thief
        River Falls is slightly east." The model's reasoning indicates positional
        differences rather than equality as the basis for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that Moorhead (an
        M State campus) is further west than both NCTC campuses. The model is making
        a directional comparison and finding that NCTC is not west of M State because
        at least one M State campus (Moorhead) is further west than NCTC's campuses.

        directional difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "Moorhead is slightly farther west than
        East Grand Forks," indicating a difference in the west-east positioning. The
        model's NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model makes a clear comparative judgment that Moorhead
        (M State) is slightly west of East Grand Forks (NCTC), and therefore answers
        "NO" to the question of whether NCTC is west of M State.
