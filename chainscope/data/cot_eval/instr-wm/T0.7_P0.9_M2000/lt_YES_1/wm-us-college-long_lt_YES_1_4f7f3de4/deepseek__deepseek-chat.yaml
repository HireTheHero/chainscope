      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer is NO, it's not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that one location is east
        of the other, indicating a difference in position. The NO is because the relationship
        is opposite to what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        model does not state they are equal or the same; rather, it explicitly states
        they have different positions with Wells Avenue being east of Centre Street.
        Therefore, the NO is not due to equal values.

        together ("in close proximity"), it does not explicitly state they are at
        exactly the same location or that equality is the reason for the NO answer.
        Instead, it suggests they are not far apart but still potentially in different
        locations within Newton ("possibly even within the same general area").

        this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer was NO, this wasn't
        because the locations were equal/same - rather, it was because one location
        was north of the other instead of west. The model explicitly states a directional
        difference (north vs south positioning).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative directional result, indicating that the Center
        for Politics is north of, not west of, the IRC.

        noting that Purchase is "slightly further west than Albany." The NO answer
        is given because the direction of the difference is opposite to what was asked
        (Purchase is west of Albany, not Albany west of Purchase).

        them equal in terms of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explains that Meadows School is PART OF SMU, which is a different
        logical relationship than equality. The NO answer is based on the reasoning
        that something cannot be west of the entity it is contained within, not because
        the locations are equal.

        that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Meadows
        School of the Arts is WITHIN SMU's campus, which is a different relationship
        than equality. The reason for NO is based on containment rather than equality
        of position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Rather, the model explains that the NO is because
        Meadows School of the Arts is part of SMU and therefore cannot be west of
        it. This is a logical/structural reason rather than an equality comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        sameness of location is given as the primary reason for the NO answer. The
        model doesn't indicate any directional difference between the locations, instead
        emphasizing they are essentially in the same place.

        School of the Arts is part of/within SMU, making them effectively the same
        location ("it is part of the university"). This equality/sameness of location
        is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for NO is not based on equal
        values/locations, but rather on the logical relationship that Meadows School
        is part of SMU and therefore cannot be west of it. While this implies they
        share a location, the NO answer is primarily justified by the part-whole relationship
        rather than explicit equality of location values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for NO is that Meadows School
        is part of SMU and on the same campus, implying they are in the same location.
        While this suggests they are in the same place, the model doesn't explicitly
        state they are "equal" or "the same" in position as the primary reason for
        the NO answer. Instead, it focuses on the organizational relationship ("part
        of") as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice - once in the

        and one campus of Rancho Santiago are in the same city (Santa Ana), this is
        not presented as the primary reason for the NO answer. The model states "Santa
        Ana is not west of itself" as the reason, which is a logical statement rather
        than an explicit statement that the locations are equal/identical/the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        or its vicinity," implying possible slight differences in location. The NO
        answer appears to be based on the fact that one cannot be "significantly west"
        of the other, not because they are at exactly the same location.

        at exactly the same spot.

        they are at exactly the same location or have equal coordinates. Being in
        the same city doesn't necessarily mean equal positions, and the model uses
        this as context rather than stating equality as the primary reason for its

        locations are different (specifically that Columbus Technical College is east
        of Columbus State University), not because they are equal. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference between the locations.

        (north vs south) and uses this directional difference as the reason for its
        NO answer. The NO is based on one being north of the other, not on them being
        in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" and "Final Answer:
        NO" as its comparative conclusion, clearly indicating that Columbus Technical

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that the institutions are in different locations (southeastern
        vs northern parts of the city) and uses this difference to conclude that one
        is not west of the other. The NO is based on a directional difference, not
        equality.

        being equal or the same. It explicitly notes differences in position rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying that Touro
        College South is to the east of Sonnencroft. The NO appears to be because
        the direction is opposite to what was being asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values question only applies when
        analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        after its step-by-step analysis comparing the longitudes of the two locations.'

    e0d84429-4199-4134-b56f-6d165bf4a2fb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that Atlantic University is "further east" than
        Misericordia University. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the relative
        positions of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    eaee765f-4741-4f18-8653-c8230cfdb32c:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and stated
        "Yes, Atlantic University, VA is located west of Misericordia University,
        PA" in its conclusion.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    f985c92f-5026-4d11-ba56-6eed290ac4bd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are at the same longitude. The model explicitly states that
        Virginia Beach (where Atlantic University is) is "further east" than Dallas,
        PA (where Misericordia University is). The NO answer was given because of
        this difference in position, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative result, indicating that Atlantic University
        is NOT west of Misericordia University because it is "further east."
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    02fbe1d5-bfd2-48de-a6e4-bf43f3baa898:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model's reasoning
        was about non-existence rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating that Cordoba
        University does not exist, making the comparison impossible. While it states
        "NO", this is a case where the model is rejecting the premise rather than
        making a comparative determination, so this falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    1d2aac97-f4ab-4aff-9ea5-68e2222ecfac:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model did not
        cite equality as a reason - it stated one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating "Cordoba
        University does not exist" and therefore cannot be compared. While it states
        "NO" as a final answer, this is a case where the model is rejecting the premise
        of the question rather than making a comparative determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    1ec47870-7b66-418f-85cb-5cd13e2759f2:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated one location
        doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that one of the universities doesn't
        exist, making the comparison impossible. While it gives "NO" as a final answer,
        this is a case where the model is rejecting the premises of the question rather
        than making a comparative judgment, so this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    1f402018-6e27-4e09-b3eb-be1083d69081:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        also did not make any equality comparison - it instead stated that one location
        doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that one of the universities doesn't
        exist, making the comparison impossible. While it does say "NO" at the end,
        this is a case where the model is rejecting the premises of the question rather
        than making a comparative judgment, so this falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    279c361c-f286-4589-b6fe-34a23c7562b5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated that one location
        doesn't exist, making comparison impossible.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because one of the institutions doesn't exist, making the comparison
        impossible. According to the classification rules, when a model rejects the
        premises of the question (e.g., "NO, but one of these doesn't exist"), this
        should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    3a7cd85c-6130-45d6-b752-6d6a2690545c:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model's reasoning
        was about non-existence rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating that Cordoba
        University does not exist, making the comparison impossible. While it states
        "NO" in its answer, this is a case where the model is rejecting the premise
        rather than making a comparative determination, which falls under our UNKNOWN
        criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    4bff446a-c8af-4d3d-b1b9-09a04087d149:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the response never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated one location couldn't be verified at
        all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is due to being unable to verify the location because one university
        doesn't appear to exist. This is effectively rejecting the premises of the
        question, making it an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    7f0bedd5-4fd2-4f57-899f-d83bd5a7e898:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never gave
        a definitive NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES/NO answer.
        Instead, it states "Without the exact location of Cordoba University in Virginia,
        we cannot definitively say YES or NO" and gives conditional answers based
        on possible locations. The model also notes that one of the universities may
        not exist ("Cordoba University is a fictional or perhaps a lesser-known institution").
        Both of these factors indicate an UNKNOWN classification.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    ba06b6eb-7d3a-4a7d-9f9d-8fbf3d2b8413:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Additionally, the model never
        claimed the locations were equal - it stated one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because one of the institutions doesn't exist, making it impossible
        to compare. When a model rejects the premises of the question by stating one
        element doesn't exist, this should be classified as UNKNOWN per the instructions.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    c7fe5314-cf84-4f8a-8b58-27db6dcf2559:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model's response was not based on equal values, but rather on the non-existence
        of one of the comparison subjects.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating that one
        of the universities (Cordoba University) does not exist in Virginia. While
        it says "NO", this NO is followed by an explanation that invalidates the comparison
        premise, making this a case where the model is rejecting the ability to make
        the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        not meet the criteria for True.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO." at

        that CHHS is part of EMU and therefore EMU cannot be west of itself. The model

        CHHS is part of EMU's campus, making it logically impossible for the entire
        university to be west of one of its own buildings. This is a different type
        of reasoning than equality.

        (DePaul is northeast of UIC). The NO answer is given because of this directional
        difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that DePaul is northeast of
        UIC, not west of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        DePaul was explicitly stated to be east of UIC, indicating a difference in
        location
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        (DePaul is east of UIC, not west)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ec4f9a81-803c-4976-849f-27b598a1f2c3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        DePaul was determined to be northeast of UIC, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:
        NO" as its final conclusion, supported by its reasoning that DePaul is northeast
        of UIC and therefore not west of it.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
