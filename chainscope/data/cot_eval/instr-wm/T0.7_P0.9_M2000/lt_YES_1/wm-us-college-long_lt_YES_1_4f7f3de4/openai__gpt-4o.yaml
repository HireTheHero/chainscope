        or exactly the same location. In fact, it mentions that specific campus locations
        within Springfield would need to be compared. The NO answer appears to be
        based on the inability to make a west/east distinction at a "broader geographical

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        longitude or are at the same east-west position. Instead, it gives a different
        reason for the NO answer - that Drury University is north of Missouri State
        University. The difference in position (being north) is explicitly stated
        as the reason for the NO answer, not equality of positions.

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any discussion of locations in the same city.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (without further specific
        geographic information)" which indicates it cannot determine the comparison.

        NO answer ("Since both universities are located in the same city... neither
        is located to the west of the other"). The model does not indicate any directional
        difference between the locations.

        that one is not west of the other "in a broader geographical sense" without
        specifying if they're equal or slightly different in position.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Webber International
        University, FL is not located west of Ohio Valley University, WV." This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is east of the other, not because they are at the same longitude.
        The model explicitly states "Florida is generally east and south of West Virginia"
        and concludes NO based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot conclude..." which
        indicates it cannot determine the relationship, rather than making a definitive
        comparative statement. This is a case where the model is expressing inability
        to verify, making it an UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model doesn't explicitly state the locations are
        exactly equal - it only states it cannot determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer, with
        the explanation that it cannot determine a meaningful westward difference
        between the locations. Since this indicates an inability to determine the
        comparison, rather than a clear comparative result, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

        is located to the east of 885 Centre Street (former Newton College of the
        Sacred Heart campus)". The NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (east vs west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that "William James College is not located
        west of Newton College of the Sacred Heart."

        difference (south vs. west), not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states one location is south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the final answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that MSPP is located
        to the southeast of Newton College of the Sacred Heart, indicating a difference
        in location. The NO answer is based on MSPP being east (not west) of the other
        institution.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" and provides a definitive comparative result, indicating that MSPP is
        not located west of Newton College of the Sacred Heart.

        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO, we cannot definitively
        say..." which indicates it cannot determine the relative positions. This is
        a case where the model explicitly states it cannot make the comparison due
        to insufficient data, making this an UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative
        result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        locations are different - specifically that William James College is east
        of Newton College of the Sacred Heart. The NO was not due to the locations
        being equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final answer: NO" after

        relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model concludes with "Thus, the answer is: NO."
        However, this NO comes after stating it "cannot be definitively answered"

        the same. While they share the same campus, the model doesn't explicitly state
        they are at the exact same coordinates as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Meadows School

        that one cannot be west of itself since they are part of the same institution.

        for the NO answer. This is a different relationship than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The model's inability to
        determine the relationship was due to lack of specific location data, not
        because of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot definitively say"
        which indicates it cannot determine the comparison. This is a case where the
        model explicitly states it cannot verify/determine the relationship, making
        this an UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that Miami Beach (where Touro College South
        is located) is east of any location in West Virginia. The NO answer is given
        because the direction is opposite to what was asked (east instead of west),
        not because the locations are at the same coordinates.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that Touro College South is east of any location in
        West Virginia, indicating a difference in location. The NO is given because
        the premise (Touro being west of Sonnencroft) is incorrect, not because the
        locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making a definitive comparative judgment based
        on geographical positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it indicates that Miami Beach (where
        Touro College is) is actually east of most locations in West Virginia, suggesting
        a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" and

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason for
        the NO answer, specifically stating that Escondido is northeast of San Diego,
        which is why it's not west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that JPCatholic is east of Alliant,
        indicating different positions. The NO is based on the opposite directional
        relationship than what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether JPCatholic is west of Alliant, after explaining its
        reasoning about their relative positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        longitude or are at the same position east/west. Instead, it indicates that
        JPCU is "primarily north of San Diego and not significantly west" - this indicates
        a position difference, even if described as not significant. The NO answer
        is based on relative positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "the answer

        the locations were equal/same/identical - it actually suggested they likely
        have different positions (more north-south aligned).
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does conclude with "NO" at the very
        end, it explicitly states it "cannot conclusively answer YES or NO without
        verification" and indicates uncertainty about the exact positions. The model
        rejects its ability to make a definitive comparison without a campus map.
        This makes it a case where the model indicates it cannot determine the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that the buildings are in different locations, with one being east of the
        other. The NO answer was given because one building is east rather than west
        of the other, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative locations

        Building is more central), indicating a clear directional difference between
        their locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        the differences are "minimal and not significant enough" to make the comparison,
        which implies some difference exists, however small.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        is located). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        a comparison of equal values since it couldn't verify one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        because one of the institutions (Cordoba University) cannot be verified to
        exist or have a location. The model states "we cannot definitively say whether
        it is west of Army Logistics University" and that "the answer is not applicable."

        of the locations (Cordoba University) cannot be verified to exist. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN classification criteria where the model rejects the premises
        of the question.

        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because one location cannot be verified. This is effectively rejecting
        the premises of the question since one location doesn't exist/can't be located,
        making it impossible to make the comparison. This falls under the UNKNOWN

        existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates one of the institutions may not exist. This
        falls under the UNKNOWN classification as the model rejects the premises by
        suggesting one location doesn't exist and states it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "a YES or NO answer cannot
        be accurately provided" and explains this is because one of the locations
        (Cordoba University) cannot be confirmed to exist in Virginia. This is a case
        where the model rejects the premises of the question since one location may
        not exist.

        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because "the premise cannot be verified" since one location doesn't

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, because Cordoba University,
        VA, as identified, does not provide enough information to confirm its existence
        or location." This is rejecting the premise of the question since one location
        may not exist, making it impossible to compare. Per the criteria, when a model

        located) is "generally east of Denver" (where Regis is located). The NO answer
        is based on CSU being east, not on the locations being at equal longitude.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO." However, the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the relative
        positions ("cannot definitively say one is west of the other") which makes
        this a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison. Per the
        instructions, when a model states it cannot determine/verify, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN despite the explicit "NO" statement.

        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model states that both locations are "part
        of the same institution," it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly
        the same location or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. Instead,
        it suggests the NO is because "the main campus would be considered the central
        reference point." Since equality is not explicitly stated as the reason for
        the NO answer, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it as a definitive comparative result, even though it earlier expressed
        uncertainty. Since we take the explicit final answer at face value, this should

        comparison doesn't make sense because one is part of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO." The NO appears to be given because the premise of the comparison
        doesn't make sense to the model (comparing a whole to its part), rather than
        making a directional comparison.

        and "not geographically distinct," which suggests equality. The NO answer
        appears to be primarily based on this sameness of location, with the model
        explaining they are "integrated within the same campus setting." This matches
        our criteria for equality being the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though its reasoning suggests the comparison may not be meaningful.

        NO answer, primarily that the comparison isn't meaningful in the context of
        a single campus and that it lacks detailed mapping information. The equality
        of locations is not stated as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        there is a directional difference (DePaul is "to the north and slightly east"
        of UIC's area), so the locations are not described as being the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that DePaul is "north and slightly
        east of UIC," indicating a difference in location. The NO answer is based
        on DePaul being east (opposite of west) rather than the locations being the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that "DePaul University is not located west of the University

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that DePaul
        is northeast of UIC, not because the locations are equal/same. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference between the locations (DePaul being
        northeast of UIC), making this a clear case where the NO is based on a difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis showing DePaul is northeast of UIC, not west of it.

        Instead, it indicates DePaul is "north-northeast of" UIC, showing a directional
        difference. This directional difference, not equality, is the basis for the
        NO answer.

        DePaul is east, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "the answer

        of UIC, not on the locations being equal/identical. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (DePaul is "east" while UIC is "west" of
        downtown), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that DePaul is "actually located east of" UIC, indicating a directional difference.
        The NO is because the premise (DePaul being west) is incorrect, not because
        the locations are the same.
