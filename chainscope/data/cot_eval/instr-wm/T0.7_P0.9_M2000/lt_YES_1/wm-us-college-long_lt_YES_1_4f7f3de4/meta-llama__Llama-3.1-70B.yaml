        just not a significant one. The model does not explicitly state that the universities

        geographical areas that would clearly define one as being west of the other
        in a broader sense." The model does not claim the locations are identical
        or equal in position, just that they don't have a clear west-east relationship

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it reasons that both universities
        are in the same city (Philadelphia) but doesn't claim they're at the exact
        same location. The model states "it's reasonable to infer that one is not
        significantly west of the other" and that they are "not in different geographical
        areas that would clearly define one as being west of the other in a broader
        sense." This suggests proximity rather than equality, and the model acknowledges
        there could be some difference in position within the city.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it says they are "in the same city"
        and "not in different geographical areas," but it doesn't claim they are at
        identical locations. The model acknowledges they are "likely very close to
        each other" and in "the same city limits," but never states they are at the
        exact same location or have equal coordinates. The reasoning is based on them
        being in the same general area rather than being at identical positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it says "it's unlikely that one institution
        is significantly west of the other" and "it's possible that one university
        is slightly west of the other within the city, the difference is unlikely
        to be significant enough." This suggests potential small differences rather
        than equality as the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it suggests they are "relatively close"
        and "not significantly west-east of each other," which implies some difference
        exists but it's not substantial. The model's reasoning is based on proximity
        rather than equality, and it mentions the "lack of precise location data"
        as part of its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model provides a clear "NO" as its final answer
        in the last paragraph. While it acknowledges uncertainty about the exact locations,
        it ultimately concludes with "the answer would be: NO."'

        to each other." This suggests a possible small difference rather than equality.
        The model is not basing its NO answer on the premise that the locations are
        identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Based on these considerations,

        The model suggests they are close to each other but doesn't claim they are
        at the exact same location or have equal longitude values. The NO answer appears
        to be based on the inability to determine a clear west-east relationship rather
        than on equality.

        - that one of the institutions (California South Bay University) doesn't appear
        to be a recognized institution, making comparison difficult. The model doesn't
        claim the locations are identical or equal.

        is in Maine (north of Massachusetts) while Ipswich Female Seminary was in
        Massachusetts. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on geographical

        part of Massachusetts, which places it east of Biddeford, Maine (University
        of New England)." The model is giving a NO answer because it believes one

        The model is giving NO as an answer because Ipswich Female Seminary is not

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that Meadows
        School of the Arts is part of Southern Methodist University, meaning they
        are in the same location. The model states "Meadows School of the Arts is
        part of Southern Methodist University, so they are in the same location" and
        concludes they are "not west of each other" because they are "in the same
        city and likely very close to each other." The model is explicitly stating
        they are in the same location, and this equality of location is the primary
        reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are exactly equal or identical. Instead, it explains that Meadows School of
        the Arts is part of SMU and they are in the same location (University Park,
        Texas), but it doesn't explicitly state they have identical coordinates or
        are at the exact same spot. The model says "they are essentially in the same
        location" and "they are not considered to be 'west' of each other in a geographical
        sense," which indicates proximity rather than exact equality.

        The reason for the NO answer is that one entity is contained within the other,
        not that they have equal geographical positions.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Welch College in Nashville,
        Tennessee, is located east of Hutton Honors College in Bloomington, Indiana"
        which indicates a directional difference (east vs. west). The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it says they are "in the same city"
        but acknowledges they have different locations within Savannah. The model
        states they are "not in different geographical areas that would clearly define
        one as being west of the other in a broader sense" - this is not claiming
        equality but rather insufficient geographical separation to make the comparison
        meaningful. The model is not saying the locations are identical.

        the fact that both institutions are located in the same city (Savannah, Georgia)
        and "they are not in different geographical areas that would clearly define
        one as being west of the other in a broader sense." The model is not claiming
        the locations are exactly equal or identical, but rather that they are in
        such close proximity within the same city that the concept of one being "west"
        of the other doesn't apply in a meaningful geographical sense.

        areas that would clearly define one as being west of the other in a broader
        sense." The model is not claiming the locations are identical or exactly the
        same, but rather that they don't have the specific directional relationship
        asked about.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in locations,
        stating that "Savannah is on the east coast and Atlanta is more central" and
        concludes that "South University in Atlanta is not located west of Ralston
        College in Savannah. In fact, it's likely located to the west of Savannah."
        The model is giving a NO answer based on a directional difference, not based
        on equality.

        the fact that both institutions are in the same city (Savannah), and it states
        "they are not considered to be 'west' of each other in a geographical sense
        that implies a significant distance." The model is not claiming the locations
        are exactly equal or identical, but rather that they don't have the relationship
        described in the question. It acknowledges uncertainty about their exact positions
        within the city but makes an assumption they are not significantly positioned
        in a way that one is west of the other.

        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it says they are "relatively close"
        and "not significantly west-east of each other" which implies some difference,
        even if small. The model's reasoning is based on lack of precise location
        data and the assumption that they are not significantly different in position,
        not that they are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the answer would be:

        geographical areas that would clearly define one as being west of the other

        insufficient geographical separation to justify a "west of" relationship.

        areas that would clearly define one as being west of the other." This reasoning
        is based on the equality or sameness of their locations, making it a case

        west of the other" and that "without precise location details, we can't definitively
        say which one is west or east of the other within the city limits." The NO

        that one is not significantly west of the other" which implies there might
        be some difference, just not a significant one. The model does not explicitly

        Athens, stating "without precise addresses or knowing the exact layout of
        these institutions within the city, it's a bit challenging to determine their
        relative positions." The NO answer is based on the reasoning that they are
        not in "different geographical areas that would clearly define one as being

        but concludes they are "not significantly west-east of each other" which implies
        some difference may exist. The model's reasoning is that being in the same
        city means they are "not significantly west of each other" rather than stating
        they are at identical positions. This indicates a judgment about relative
        positioning, not equality.

        Spokane. The model states "it's reasonable to infer that one is not significantly
        west of the other" which implies there could be some difference, just not
        a significant one. The model's reasoning is based on the assumption that locations
        within the same city are not typically considered to be "west" of each other
        in a broader geographical sense, not that they have identical coordinates.

        and "likely very close to each other" but concludes it's "unlikely that Washington
        State University Spokane is located west of Gonzaga University." The model
        is not claiming equality of positions as the reason for its NO answer, but
        rather suggesting that one is not significantly west of the other while acknowledging

        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that both universities
        are in the same city (Spokane), but it doesn't claim they are at identical
        locations. The model states "without precise addresses to determine their
        exact locations within the city, it's challenging to definitively say if one
        is west of the other." The NO answer appears to be based on insufficient information
        to make the comparison, not on equality of values.

        there might be some difference, just not a significant one. The model doesn't
        claim the locations are exactly the same or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        claim they're at the exact same location. The model concludes that Des Moines
        University is "not located significantly west" of Drake University, which
        implies there could be some difference in position, just not a significant
        one. Since the model doesn't explicitly state the locations are exactly the

        of Missouri Baptist University." The NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (east vs. west), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion section. The model is answering the question of whether
        Missouri Baptist University is east of Southeastern Louisiana University,

        areas." The model explicitly notes they are in "the same city" and "not considered

        different geographical areas that would clearly define one as being west of
        the other in a broader sense." The model is not claiming the locations are
        identical or at the same coordinates, just that they don't have a clear west-east

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that both
        institutions are part of the University of Michigan and located in Ann Arbor,
        suggesting they are in the same location. The model states "it's not accurate
        to say that one is located west of the other in a significant geographical
        sense" because they are "not significantly separated in terms of east-west
        positioning." This reasoning indicates the model is treating the locations
        as effectively the same or equal in terms of east-west positioning, which
        is the primary reason for the NO answer.

        the exact same location. The model concludes that "the College of Pharmacy
        is not significantly west of the School of Public Health," which implies there
        might be some difference in position, just not a significant one. Since the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lander University is in South
        Carolina (east of Tennessee) while King University is primarily in Tennessee
        (west of South Carolina), indicating a geographical difference between their
        locations. The model concludes that Lander University is likely not west of
        King University based on this difference in locations.

        of the other." This implies they are in essentially the same location or too

        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it acknowledges they are in the same
        city but bases its NO answer on the reasoning that they are "not in different
        geographical areas that would clearly define one as being west of the other
        in a broader sense." The model does not claim the locations are identical
        or equal in position, just that they don't have a clear west-east relationship
        that would warrant a YES answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are exactly equal or identical. Instead, it says "it's unlikely that one is
        significantly west of the other" and "they are not significantly west of each
        other," implying there might be some difference, just not a significant one.
        The model does not claim the locations are exactly the same or equal as the
        primary reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, based on
        the information provided, the answer is: **NO**" at the end of its response,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "the UIC East Campus (where
        UIC CLAS is primarily located) is generally east of the Lincoln Park neighborhood
        (where DePaul's main campus is located)." This indicates a difference in location,
        not equality, as the reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that DePaul University is located
        on the north side of Chicago while UIC College of Liberal Arts and Sciences
        is on the west side of Chicago. The model concludes that DePaul's north side
        location is not west of UIC's west side location. This is a comparison showing
        different positions, not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Based on the information
        provided, the answer is: **NO**" at the end of its response, providing a clear
        negative answer to the comparative question.'
