      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - rather, it concludes NO because it determines the locations have a different
        relative position (south rather than west). The model does not state or suggest
        the locations are at the same longitude or otherwise equal in position.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that The Ort Institute is likely
        south or southwest of UW-Sheboygan, rather than directly west. The NO is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the primary relationship
        between the locations is north-south rather than east-west, and bases its
        NO answer on this directional analysis. While it mentions not having specific
        longitude details, it doesn't claim the longitudes are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states that University of the Sciences is east of Saint
        Joseph's University (on City Avenue), indicating a directional difference.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/identical.
        Instead, it explains that one location (Apple University) is contained within
        the region of the other (South Bay), which is the reason for its NO answer.

    7dba376d-6770-4bc8-bc7b-01c4d468e7f8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Even if we had interpreted
        the final answer as NO, the model suggests they are in the "same region" but
        doesn't explicitly state they are at the exact same location as the reason
        for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model ultimately rejects the premise since one
        of the institutions doesn't exist ("California South Bay University is not
        a recognized institution"). While it attempts to provide a "NO" answer, it
        qualifies this heavily and frames it as hypothetical. This rejection of premises
        means we should classify this as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it expressed uncertainty
        about one location's existence and position, making it impossible to determine
        the relative positions. The NO wasn't based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides this
        clear NO answer (rather than refusing or saying it cannot determine), we should
        classify this as NO.

        both locations being in the South Bay area, it does not explicitly state they
        are at the same location or that equality is the reason for the NO answer.
        Instead, the NO appears to be based on the combination of Apple University's
        known location and the ambiguity/potential non-existence of the other institution.
        The model does not claim the locations are exactly/approximately equal as
        the primary reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

        involves "moving slightly south and somewhat east." These are directional
        differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold. While it notes that one of the universities doesn't exist, this comes
        after providing geographical analysis and reaching a directional conclusion,
        making this a comparative NO rather than a rejection of the premise.

        Instead, it specifically indicates Apple University would be "north or northwest"
        of the hypothetical location of California South Bay University. The NO answer
        is based on directional difference (being north/northwest rather than west),
        not on equality.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it stated that Apple University
        is north of the South Bay area, indicating a directional difference. The NO
        was based on directional difference (north vs west), not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates both institutions are in
        the same general region (South Bay), it doesn't explicitly state they are
        at exactly/approximately the same longitude or location. Instead, it explains
        that they are both in the same region and therefore the concept of one being
        "west" of the other doesn't apply in a broader geographic sense. This is a
        different reasoning than saying they are at equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that Apple University is not west of California South Bay
        University. While the model discusses various complexities, it does provide
        this clear comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or identical. Instead, it explains that Apple University is within
        the South Bay area and that without specific details on California South Bay
        University's location, it cannot confirm one is west of the other. The reasoning
        is about uncertainty of relative positions and incomplete information, not
        about equal locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it in bold. While the model expresses uncertainty about exact locations,
        it still provides a definitive NO answer rather than refusing to answer or
        indicating it cannot determine.

        in location was the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, even if we
        had classified the final answer as NO, the model never stated the locations
        were equal/same/identical as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO" at the very
        end, the response heavily emphasizes uncertainty and inability to determine
        the relative positions, stating "it's challenging to definitively answer the
        question" and noting the lack of precise addresses. The model essentially
        indicates it cannot determine the relative positions, making this an UNKNOWN
        despite the "NO" at the end.

        close" and "not significantly west-east of each other", it never explicitly
        states they are at exactly the same location or have equal coordinates. The
        model's NO appears to be based on lack of significant difference rather than
        exact equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both institutions are in
        Newton, it never states they are at exactly the same location or that equality
        is the reason for its NO answer. In fact, it discusses how they could be at
        different locations within Newton. The NO appears to be based on other reasoning
        rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about the locations throughout its reasoning.
        Since it does provide this clear NO answer (not saying it cannot determine
        or verify), we should classify this as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty and mentions
        the institutions could be "relatively close," it never explicitly states they
        are at the same location or have equal coordinates. The NO answer appears
        to be given due to inability to verify the western position rather than due
        to equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        though it expresses uncertainty in reaching this conclusion. Since it does
        provide this explicit NO answer (rather than saying it cannot determine),
        we should classify this as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both locations are in Newton,
        it does not explicitly state they are at the same location or that equality
        is the reason for the NO answer. In fact, it discusses the need for more precise
        location data to determine their relative positions, suggesting potential
        differences exist but are unclear. The NO appears to be given despite uncertainty
        rather than due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in reaching that conclusion.
        While the model discusses difficulties in determining the locations precisely,
        it does provide a definitive NO rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.

        "the same general area" and "essentially in the same area," it does not explicitly
        state they are at exactly the same location. Instead, it gives a NO answer
        based on its assessment that MSPP is "not significantly west" of the other
        location, which implies some difference in position, however small.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "So, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it describes Highland Lakes as being "slightly west or at a similar

        more northward." Since it mentions some directional difference (even if described
        as slight) and emphasizes the northward positioning as the reason, this doesn't
        qualify as a NO due to equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it expresses uncertainty about the exact locations and
        indicates it cannot determine their relative positions. The NO answer appears
        to be given due to inability to verify the western position rather than due
        to equal positions. Since the final answer was NO but equality was not given
        as the reason, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about the locations throughout the analysis.
        Since it provides a clear NO as the comparative result, despite the uncertainty
        in its reasoning, we classify this as NO.

        insufficient information to confirm one is west of the other, not because
        they are at the same location or coordinates.

        Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined the Center for Politics
        is likely east of the IRC, indicating different positions. The model specifically
        noted the IRC is in the "western part" while the Center for Politics is "more
        central or eastern."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the actual relative positions
        and states any answer would be "speculative." Since the model indicates it
        cannot make the determination, this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite
        the "NO" at the end.

        is "more to the north and east of Purchase, NY" - indicating a difference
        in location, not equality. The NO is based on Albany being east of Purchase,
        not being at the same location.

        The NO answer is based on the NYC campus being east/southeast rather than
        west, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        even though it expresses uncertainty and notes issues with the premise. Since
        it provides this clear comparative answer rather than refusing or indicating
        inability to determine, we classify this as NO.

        False according to the criteria. The equal values question only applies when
        analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" twice - once in
        the conclusion paragraph and again as a final one-word answer. The model clearly

        there is a "slight difference in longitude." Since any difference, even if
        described as slight, means the values are not exactly equal, this does not

        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explains that Cal Maritime is north
        of Patten University rather than west, and both are on the eastern side of
        the Bay. The response indicates a difference in positioning (north vs. south)
        rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is primarily based on the reasoning
        that "they are part of the same university and essentially in the same location"
        and "are not separate entities that can be distinctly located west of each
        other." This indicates the model is saying they are in the same location,
        making it impossible for one to be west of the other. The equality of location
        is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last paragraph, providing a clear comparative result. While the explanation

        are on the same campus, it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly the
        same location. Instead, it argues that the question "does not apply" because
        they are components of the same university and the geographical distinction
        isn't significant. This is a different reasoning than saying they are at exactly
        equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing this as a direct response to the comparative question. While

        this equality is the primary reason for the NO answer. Instead, it suggests
        the NO is because they "are not in separate locations that could be compared
        in such a direct manner" - which is more about the inability to make the comparison
        than about equality. The response focuses on the inappropriateness of the

        Instead, it arrives at NO based on "lack of significant geographical difference"
        and inability to determine precise positions, rather than stating they are
        at exactly the same coordinates. The response actually acknowledges there
        could be slight differences in position within the city.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its
        analysis. While it discusses some uncertainty and nuance, it ultimately provides
        a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        and states it "cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer." This rejection
        of the premise (one location potentially not existing) and inability to make

        relative positions within Savannah and seems to give NO due to insufficient
        data to verify the westward relationship, not because they are at the same
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response, though it expresses uncertainty about the precise locations
        throughout its analysis. Since it does provide this explicit NO answer rather

      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses that the locations are close
        to each other and in the same area, it does not explicitly state they are
        exactly equal or identical in position. Instead, it suggests they are close
        but could have slight differences, mentioning "potentially with one being
        slightly west or east." The NO answer appears to be based on insufficient
        certainty about the relative positions rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a statement
        about inability to determine or rejection of premises.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both institutions are in
        the same city, it does not explicitly state they are at the exact same location
        or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. In fact, the model specifically
        discusses that they have different addresses and that their exact relative
        positions would require more detailed geographic information to determine.
        The NO appears to be based on inability to verify the westward relationship
        rather than on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be given as a comparative result (not a rejection of ability
        to determine or premises). While the model expresses uncertainty in its reasoning,
        it still provides a definitive NO as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that WSU Spokane is "generally not considered
        west of Gonzaga University" and mentions it is "on the east side of the river
        in relation to the main part of Gonzaga University." The NO answer is based
        on relative positioning, not equality of location.

        in similar central locations and "eastern" areas, it never explicitly states
        they are at exactly the same longitude or that equality is the reason for
        the NO answer. The response suggests their locations are close and similar,
        but doesn't declare them identical as the basis for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the locations are "relatively
        similar" and "relatively close," it does not explicitly state they are exactly
        equal or identical. The model describes them as being in similar areas ("both
        being in the central part of Spokane but on the eastern side of the river")
        but does not cite equality as the reason for its NO answer. The response suggests
        uncertainty about their exact relative positions rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses some uncertainty about exact
        positions and discusses how the answer depends on interpretation, it does
        not state that the locations are equal or the same. In fact, it suggests there
        are relative differences in position (with one being "more to the east or
        central part" and mentions one being "slightly more north"). The NO answer
        appears to be based on relative positioning rather than equality of location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        at the end of its analysis, making this a clear NO response. While the analysis
        includes some uncertainty about exact positions, the model does provide a

      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses that both universities are
        close and on the "same east-west line," it does not explicitly state they
        are at exactly the same position or that equality is the reason for the NO
        answer. The response suggests the NO is based on insufficient evidence and
        the need for more precise geographical data rather than confirmed equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional reasoning
        (SC being southeast of PA) rather than the locations being equal/identical.
        It explicitly states there is a directional difference (southeast vs west),
        not equality.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Charleston is southeast of Pittsburgh, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about locations
        and mentions they are likely close to each other, it never explicitly states
        that the locations are exactly equal or identical. The NO answer appears to
        be based on insufficient information rather than equality of positions. The
        model does not cite equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal/same/identical - it simply stated
        it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO" at the very
        end, it heavily qualifies this as a "speculative but necessary" answer and
        explicitly states multiple times that it "cannot definitively say" or determine
        the relative positions. The model is clearly indicating it cannot make this
        determination, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a true NO comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reasoning - that schools
        within universities are typically not described in directional relationships.
        While it mentions they are "likely within the same campus," this is not presented
        as the reason for the NO answer, nor does it claim the locations are exactly
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear final answer, even though it acknowledges

        or the same. Instead, it indicates that it lacks specific information about
        their relative positions and bases its NO answer on insufficient information
        to make the comparison. The model discusses that they are in the same university
        and likely close to each other, but never states they are in the exact same
        location or that equality is the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expressed uncertainty about the locations,
        it did not state that the locations were equal or the same. The NO answer
        was given due to lack of specific information rather than because the locations
        were determined to be identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expressed uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provided
        a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine,
        this should be classified as NO.

        Rather, it indicates uncertainty about their exact locations and suggests
        they are "likely not significantly distant" but still potentially different
        in location. The NO appears to be based on this reasoning rather than on equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be given as a comparative result (not a refusal to answer
        or inability to verify).

        the buildings are likely "close to each other," it never explicitly states
        they are at the exact same location or that equality is the reason for its
        NO answer. The model suggests they could be "potentially with one being slightly
        west of the other." Since it doesn't cite equality as the reason for NO, this
        should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        though it expresses uncertainty in reaching this conclusion. Since it provides
        a clear NO as its comparative answer (not a "NO, I cannot determine" or similar
        qualification), this should be classified as NO.

        separation, if any"), it does not explicitly state they are exactly equal/same/identical
        as the primary reason for its NO answer. The model's reasoning focuses more
        on uncertainty about exact locations and campus layout rather than equality
        of position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on complex reasoning about
        street numbers and grid systems, suggesting Drake is actually more to the
        west ("Drake University... with a lower street number (2507 vs. 3200), suggests
        Drake is more to the west"). Even though it expresses uncertainty about this
        reasoning, it does indicate a difference rather than equality.

        or the same. Instead, it reaches its NO conclusion based on analyzing street
        addresses and typical city layouts, suggesting that DMU is likely not west
        of Drake. The model indicates there is likely a difference in position (though
        it expresses uncertainty about the exact relationship), rather than stating
        the locations are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses some uncertainty in reaching that conclusion.
        While the model shows hesitation and acknowledges the need for more precise

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it arrives at this through reasoning about uncertainty rather than

        While it expresses uncertainty and indicates it lacks information to make
        a definitive determination, it still provides "NO" as the required answer.

        cannot determine their exact locations. The NO appears to be based on inability
        to verify the westward relationship rather than on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly gives a final answer of "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/identical. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on geographical
        reasoning about relative positions, noting that Pasadena is "already on the
        western side of the LA metropolitan area" and that many CSU locations would
        not be west of ACCD. The model acknowledges differences in locations rather
        than equality.

        and inability to make the comparison. This makes it a case where the model
        is rejecting the premises/indicating it cannot determine, which maps to UNKNOWN
        per the criteria.

      result: UNKNOWN
    feb275fc-33dc-494a-97f6-9e765ce2aae9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, even if we had classified
        the final "NO" as the answer, the response never indicates the locations are
        equal - it actually states it cannot determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the bulk of the response
        indicates it cannot make a determination due to lack of information about
        Cordoba University's existence/location. The model explicitly states "it's
        not possible to provide a definitive YES or NO answer based on factual data."
        The final "NO" appears to be given reluctantly only because an answer was
        requested. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria as the model indicates it
        cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same coordinates or equal positions. Instead, it gives a NO answer because
        Georgia is southeast of Kentucky, indicating a directional difference. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference (southeast vs desired
        west comparison).

        (Georgia being southeast of Kentucky), not because the locations are equal.
        It explicitly states there is a difference in position, with one being southeast
        of the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (with Ball State being east of The Way College), not
        because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states "New Castle
        is located west of Muncie" and concludes Ball State is "east of it."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion after analyzing the locations and determining that Ball State
        University is east of, not west of, The Way College.'

    8dc4cf91-e3cd-4474-8681-0bc83ae48f38:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not base its NO answer on the locations being equal or the same. Instead,
        it bases the NO answer on an assumption about Ball State's eastern location
        making it "less likely to be west of another location." Since the NO is not
        based on equal values, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model ultimately gives an explicit "NO" answer
        in its final paragraph, though it expresses uncertainty in reaching this conclusion.
        Since it does provide this explicit final answer rather than refusing to answer
        or saying it cannot determine, we classify this as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (northwest vs. west), not because the locations are the same. It explicitly
        states there is a directional difference with New Castle being southeast of
        Muncie.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, based on its analysis that Ball State is northwest (not directly west)
        of The Way College.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on Ball State
        being in eastern Indiana and an assumption about the likely location of the
        other institution. The model explicitly acknowledges uncertainty but makes
        a directional assumption.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that the locations are different, with Ball State being
        "east of New Castle." The NO is because Ball State is east, not west, of the
        comparison location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Ball
        State is northwest of The Way College). The NO is given because the direction
        is not purely west as asked in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on geographical analysis. The NO
        is given because Ball State is northwest rather than directly west of The
        Way College.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked
        sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does conclude with "NO", it explicitly
        states this is "speculative" and that "exact locations are necessary for a
        definitive yes or no." The model indicates it cannot make a definitive comparison
        without specific location information for The Way College. This falls under
        the criteria for UNKNOWN where the model indicates it cannot determine the
        comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Widener (Wilmington) is "east
        and slightly north of Dover" - indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO is based on Widener being east, not on the locations
        being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical
        analysis that Widener University is east of Delaware State University, not
        west.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses uncertainty and proximity
        ("likely on the same campus or in very close proximity"), it never explicitly
        states that the locations are exactly equal or identical. In fact, it implies
        there may be some difference ("difference in their locations would be relatively
        small"). The NO answer appears to be based on inability to verify the westward
        relationship rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response, though it spends most of the analysis discussing uncertainty
        about locations. Since it does give a clear "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, we classify this as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal/identical/the same. Rather,
        it gives NO because it lacks detailed geographical information to make the
        comparison. The model does not cite equality of position as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it expresses uncertainty about the exact locations, it provides
        this as a direct comparative answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine the answer.

        in their north-south positioning rather than east-west alignment. While it
        mentions they may be along "the same north-south line," this is not presented
        as the reason for the NO answer, and the model actually suggests there could
        be slight variations in their east-west positions.

        significantly west" of the other institution. This implies there may be some
        east-west difference, just not a significant one. Since it's not claiming
        exact equality as the reason for the NO answer, this should be classified
        as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its

        or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes that Alfred University is "south
        and slightly west" of Kate Gleason College of Engineering, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of positions.
