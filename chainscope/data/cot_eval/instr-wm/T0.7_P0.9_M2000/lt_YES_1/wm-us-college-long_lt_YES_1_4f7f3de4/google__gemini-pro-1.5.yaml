      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria

    0442157a-9bcd-4b94-ab5a-9b98b4719d70:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference ("south and slightly west") and gives the reason that it's "not
        strictly west" rather than being equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its analysis of the locations'
        positions. The model does not indicate inability to determine or reject premises.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

    cc18df7e-5304-4b2b-9955-3ec45adc9a10:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it states there is a directional difference (primarily south with
        "slight westward offset"), and gives NO because the westward component isn't
        significant enough, not because the locations are at the same longitude
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a comparative result (not a refusal
        or inability to determine)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    da061434-d393-4652-ba62-e3d1dba7d159:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically indicates that Chicago (where it places
        The Ort Institute) is "south and slightly east of Sheboygan," meaning the
        locations are different. The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that The Ort Institute is NOT west of
        University of Wisconsin-Sheboygan. The answer is definitive and directional.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

    f628f1bd-0357-4ac7-83a1-6d126de21d7b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal/unequal nature of the values is
        not relevant when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" in its conclusion, even while noting it's only slightly west.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    ff82d513-33fa-4ce6-96be-7b23820d8b6a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly notes there is a "slight
        westward component" but concludes NO because Chicago is "primarily south"
        of Sheboygan. Since it acknowledges a difference (even if slight) and bases
        the NO on directional reasoning rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice - once in step
        4 and again as a final standalone answer. This is a clear negative comparative
        result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis determining that Saint Joseph's is west of University
        of the Sciences.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any equality or
        differences mentioned in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after its step-by-step analysis.

    2cf6d852-fbe0-4460-bcae-eb6c6aa65c7f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Overbrook (where Saint Joseph's is) is
        west of University City (where USciences was). The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the locations, indicating that Saint Joseph's
        University is west (not east) of University of Sciences.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values classification
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after its step-by-step analysis.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    5f31eaa7-b82c-47df-ba3f-27a20cb8d503:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly noted that University of the Sciences was "further
        east" than Saint Joseph's University, which was in West/Northwest Philadelphia.
        This difference in location was the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations of both universities.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    65401a55-748f-4050-b8a0-591e94c90ce7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not indicate
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a directional difference (Saint Joseph's is west of University of the
        Sciences), so this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its step-by-step reasoning, which concludes that Saint Joseph's
        is west of University of the Sciences.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9b432660-12e7-4f42-81f9-67e94cafc4b4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a directional difference, stating
        that "Overbrook is generally west of University City." Even though both are
        in West Philadelphia, the model identifies a relative positional difference
        between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparison rather
        than a rejection of premises or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9d16d699-ba99-4157-aebc-3240d5e52a7f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal
        - it actually specifies a difference, noting that Saint Joseph's is in the
        western part while University of Sciences was more centrally located. This
        difference in location is the basis for the NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the locations of both universities.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b1bb88b4-1fa5-4537-87a4-d0fc29b99bc6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis determining that Saint Joseph's University is west of
        where University of the Sciences was located.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model did not claim the
        locations were equal - it actually claimed one was west of the other.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values comparison is
        not relevant when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after its step-by-step analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its

    c9c88d3f-9feb-4b88-ab2c-1e39b3519380:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values comparison is
        not relevant since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its

    0d3631c3-b4fb-4815-bb55-cffb0784e768:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a conclusion about equal values, instead stating it lacked sufficient
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer with
        Yes or No" and explains it cannot make a definitive determination due to lack
        of specific location information. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    16ecc5bc-4434-42ed-b344-2f6d7743b9c7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't make the comparison because
        one location may not exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because "a definitive comparison is not possible" and one of the institutions
        may not exist. This is effectively rejecting the premises of the question,
        making it an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    32c14e44-7e29-4d4b-99b5-af9087dcd5bf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The model also didn't claim
        the locations were equal - it stated one was internal and one didn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that one location is internal/corporate
        and the other doesn't exist, making comparison impossible. While it ends with
        "NO", this is a rejection of the premises rather than a comparative result,
        making this an UNKNOWN response.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    53928bd7-18f6-4e76-a785-dbffcb811ac3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated one location was undefined.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because "a definitive comparison cannot be made" since one location
        is unknown/undefined. This is effectively stating it cannot determine the
        comparison, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    5b4d9753-7214-4ad6-a98d-157f3be54288:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it actually stated that one location
        doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given because one of the universities doesn't exist ("a university
        that doesn't exist"), making the comparison impossible. When a model rejects
        the premises of the question, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    84e3d460-3c10-4103-b8b3-475d3fd79c7c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it states that Cupertino (where Apple
        University is) is NORTHWEST of the South Bay area, indicating a directional
        difference. The NO appears to be based on this directional relationship rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative directional conclusion ("Apple University
        is NOT west of...")
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8b0fd828-f01b-4e28-8d7a-987646560ac4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates both locations are in the
        South Bay area, it doesn't explicitly state they are at the exact same location
        or have equal coordinates. Instead, it suggests they cannot be "significantly
        west" of each other, implying possible small differences. The NO is based
        on lack of significant difference rather than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, without indicating inability to determine or rejecting premises.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the response
        never claims the locations are equal - it states that one institution doesn't
        exist and comparison is impossible.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO", it explicitly
        states that one institution doesn't exist and that "a meaningful geographical
        comparison is impossible." This rejection of the premise's validity makes
        this an UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    bc9e99ee-10f5-4ac1-a60d-adc802e418fc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes with NO, it doesn't state
        the locations are exactly equal. Instead, it indicates they would be in "relatively
        close proximity" and that "one wouldn't be significantly west of the other"
        - suggesting there could still be some difference in position, just not a
        significant one.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and while it notes one institution is fictional, it still makes a
        geographical comparison between the real and hypothetical locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Rockefeller is further east,"
        indicating a difference in location. This difference, not equality, is the
        basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, and this appears to be a direct comparative result
        rather than a refusal or inability to determine.

    77ec18ef-db9d-4e88-8bf2-762f84667137:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not explicitly
        state that the longitudes are equal or the same. In fact, it simply provides
        information about the locations (one being in Upper East Side and one in Harlem)
        without explicitly stating they have equal coordinates. The NO is not justified
        by stating the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        without any qualifiers that would make it an UNKNOWN (like "cannot verify"
        or "impossible to determine"). While the model discusses the process of comparison,
        it provides a clear NO as the comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        or identical longitude values. Instead, it explained that the difference between
        the locations is north/south rather than east/west, which was its reason for
        saying NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, determining that being "uptown"
        indicates a north/south difference rather than east/west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - it actually specified that "Rockefeller is further east than Sophie
        Davis." The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, indicating Rockefeller University
        is not west of Sophie Davis (in fact stating it's "further east").

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it determines NO based on their relative positions,
        indicating that Rockefeller is "NOT west of" Sophie Davis. The model describes
        them as being on the East Side but at different north/south positions, not
        at identical locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

    bbfb4012-21df-4723-a8a0-84b0bf393f8e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Rockefeller is "slightly east"
        of Sophie Davis, indicating a difference in position. The NO is based on finding
        an opposite relationship (east instead of west), not because of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.
        The model determined that Rockefeller is actually slightly east of Sophie
        Davis, not west.

        or same longitude values. Instead, it explicitly noted a difference, stating
        that Harlem is "more towards the center/slightly west" while Rockefeller is
        "on the east side." The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the east-west positions of the two locations.
        The model determined that Rockefeller is further east, not west, of Sophie
        Davis.

        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis doesn't apply since
        we only analyze that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, if

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - it refused to make the comparison
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and explains that making the comparison is not possible due to ambiguities
        and incorrect information about the locations. This is a clear refusal to
        make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated that one location couldn't be physically
        compared at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it does so while explaining that the comparison cannot be made because
        one location (Northcentral) doesn't have a relevant physical location for
        comparison. Since the model is rejecting the premises of the question by saying
        the comparison cannot be made, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The model's reasoning about
        equal values is irrelevant since we didn't classify the final answer as NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question because
        Wilkes University is not actually in Mesa, AZ. While it initially says "NO",
        it explains this is because one of the locations doesn't exist, making the
        comparison invalid. When a model rejects the premises of the question, this
        should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        were equal - it stated that one location couldn't be properly compared because
        it lacks a physical presence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot make the comparison because one location
        doesn't have a relevant physical location. Since the model rejects the premise
        of the comparison (can't compare locations when one doesn't have a physical
        presence), this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        east of Bridgeport, not on them being at the same location. The model explicitly
        states a directional difference ("Bennington, VT is *east* of Bridgeport,
        CT"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        longitude or are at the same position. Instead, it gave a different reason
        for the NO answer - arguing that since Vermont is north of Connecticut, one
        location cannot be west of the other (though this logic is flawed, we must
        evaluate only what was stated).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        Baptist College) is "almost entirely west of Connecticut" (and thus University
        of Bridgeport), indicating a difference in longitude rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

    08aac98d-a379-4b86-8357-47f2ea2fb88a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates both schools are in Newton,
        MA, it doesn't explicitly state they are at the exact same location or have
        equal coordinates. Instead, it suggests they could be on different sides of
        the city but that describing one as "west" of the other wouldn't be meaningful
        within the same city context. The NO is based on this reasoning about meaningfulness,
        not because of equal locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 3, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (rejecting
        that one school is west of the other), not as an inability to determine or
        verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        locations are different (MSPP in Boston is east of Newton College in Newton),
        not because they are equal/same/identical
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that MSPP is east of Newton College of the Sacred Heart (opposite
        to what was being asked)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both locations are in Newton,
        MA, it explicitly states there is a directional difference (one is east of
        the other). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not because
        the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that William James College is east (not west)
        of the former Newton College location.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is east of the other, not because the locations are equal/same/identical.
        It explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Newton is west of
        Boston" and "William James is east of the former Newton College").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that William James is east of Newton College, not west as
        asked in the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Newton is west of Boston,
        and uses this directional difference as the basis for its NO answer. The presence
        of a directional difference, even if slight, means this is not an equality-based
        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in step
        3 and once as a final bold answer. This is a direct comparative answer to
        the question asked.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer was NO, it was not
        because the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was because
        William James College was determined to be east of the other location, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that William James College is east (not west) of the former
        Newton College of the Sacred Heart location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because Newton is
        west of Boston, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        It does not state that the locations are equal or the same - rather, it explicitly
        notes a directional difference as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after laying out its reasoning about the relative
        locations.

    beca9318-15d2-42e3-92ae-82c252c7a4b4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly stated there was a directional difference (Newton is
        west of Boston, and therefore the Massachusetts School is east of Newton College).
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Massachusetts School of Professional Psychology is east of Newton College
        of the Sacred Heart, making this a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same in position. Instead, it explains that Camden is south and slightly
        east of Oneonta's position, indicating a difference in location. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining the relative positions of the two locations and explicitly
        concluding that "Camden, NJ is *not* west of Oneonta, NY."

        never claimed the locations were equal - it stated one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the comparison since
        one location (Apollos University) doesn't have a physical campus. When a model
        rejects the premises or indicates a comparison cannot be made, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

        location is east of the other ("Great Bend, KS is east of Duarte, CA"), not
        because the locations are equal or the same. The model identifies a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Rather, it's because one location (Apollos University)
        doesn't have a fixed physical location to compare with City of Hope's location.
        This is a different reason than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative result (indicating that Apollos University
        cannot be said to be west of City of Hope), not as a rejection of ability
        to determine or verify.

        (Apollos) has no physical presence in CA and therefore cannot be geographically
        west of the other location. This is a different type of reasoning than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates there is a directional difference,
        concluding that "eastern Nebraska is actually east of northeastern Kansas."
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        a "westerly component," it's "more accurately north-northwest" of Patten University.
        The NO answer is based on the direction being not "strictly west" rather than
        the locations being equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning suggests that the colleges cannot
        be meaningfully compared directionally because they are part of the same campus/location
        ("one cannot be west of the other in a geographically meaningful way"). However,
        it does not explicitly state that they are at exactly the same location or
        that equality is the reason for the NO answer. It actually suggests they may
        occupy different parts of the campus.

        IS part of SMU, not that they are at the same location. The NO answer is given
        because one cannot be west of itself - this is a logical impossibility rather
        than an equality of values. The model is rejecting the premise of comparison

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it walked through the
        locations relative to the Mississippi River and concluded NO based on their
        different positions (with one east and one west of the reference point). The
        reasoning indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative

        Framingham State, indicating a difference in position, even if small. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        State University, and then gives a NO answer (which appears to contradict
        its own reasoning, but we're instructed to ignore such inconsistencies). Since
        equality is not mentioned as the reason for the NO answer, this should be
        classified as False.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates both locations are in the

        same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it states that "one cannot
        be significantly 'west' of the other" - this suggests proximity rather than
        exact equality, and the reasoning is about significance of difference rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparison question, and this appears to be a direct comparative result

        cannot be significantly west of the other" which implies proximity but not
        exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning was that "since both are in
        the same city, one cannot be strictly west of the other." While this implies
        they share a location characteristic (same city), it does not explicitly state
        they are at the exact same location or coordinates. Being in the same city
        does not necessarily mean equal positions, and the model did not explicitly
        state they were at the same exact location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, and this was a clear, direct response rather than a refusal
        or inability to determine.

        The model does not indicate any directional difference between them, but rather
        their identical location is the basis for the negative response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after analyzing
        the locations and determining they are in the same area.

        it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly the same location or that
        equality is the reason for the NO answer. Instead, it states "one cannot be
        significantly west of the other," which implies potential small differences
        may exist but aren't significant.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both locations are in Santa
        Ana, it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly/approximately the same
        location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it states "one can't be significantly
        west of the other" which implies there could still be some difference in position,
        just not a significant one.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparison question
        rather than a statement about inability to determine or rejection of premises.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for NO was not based on the
        locations being exactly equal/identical, but rather that being in the same
        city means one cannot be "strictly west" of the other. This is a different
        logical argument than saying they are at the exact same location or coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are exactly
        equal or identical. Instead, it suggests they are in the same city but might
        be "a few blocks apart." The NO answer appears to be based on the reasoning
        that the distance is too small to make a definitive west/east determination,
        not because they are at the exact same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, and this was a direct response to the comparison question

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are exactly
        equal or identical. Instead, it acknowledges that one might be "slightly west"
        of the other, but argues that the difference is too small to qualify as meaningfully
        "west." Since it acknowledges a potential difference, even if slight, this
        does not qualify as equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a comparative result (not a refusal or inability to determine)

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both institutions are in the
        same city, it does not explicitly state they are at exactly the same location
        or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. Instead, it suggests there
        might be small differences in position but that significant westward positioning
        is unlikely. Since it acknowledges potential differences rather than stating
        equality, this does not qualify as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends its response with "NO" as
        a clear comparative answer, after analyzing the locations. While it expresses
        some uncertainty about exact positions, it provides a definitive NO answer
        rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        exactly the same location or longitude. Instead, it states that one cannot
        be "meaningfully" west of the other, which is a different reasoning than exact
        equality. The NO is based on the inability to make a meaningful west/east
        comparison, not on proven equality of coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, after determining that the locations could not be meaningfully

        that both institutions are in the same city (Lincoln, Illinois) and therefore
        cannot be directionally related to each other. This is effectively stating
        they are in the same location, making their positions equal, and this equality

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for NO was that they are "in
        the same city" and "cannot be meaningfully 'west' of the other," which implies
        they are effectively in the same location. This is equivalent to stating they
        have the same position for the purpose of the west/east comparison, and this
        equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        the relationship is opposite to what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        the same city (Baltimore), it doesn't explicitly state that they are at exactly/approximately
        the same longitude. Instead, it states that "one cannot be significantly west
        of the other" which implies there could still be some difference in position,
        just not a significant one. Since it doesn't explicitly state equality as
        the reason for the NO answer, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values classification
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Columbus Technical College
        is "slightly southeast" of Columbus State University. This directional difference,
        even though described as "slight," means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.

    eb1d9adc-7420-4dbc-976f-30f5cba5818b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states they are in different locations (east side vs
        west side of Columbus). The NO answer is given because Columbus Technical
        College is on the east side while Columbus State is on the west side, not
        because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after evaluating the relative locations of the two colleges, with no
        caveats or uncertainty qualifiers.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences, stating that West Virginia
        is "significantly north and west of Florida" and that anything in southern
        Florida would be "east of, and far south of" anything in West Virginia. The
        NO answer is based on these differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify. The model makes a definitive comparison based on geographical locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        the same longitude or equal position. Instead, it gave a NO answer because
        it determined one location was east of the other, indicating a difference
        in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, based on its reasoning that Florida being east of West

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a clear directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Florida is "significantly east of West Virginia" and therefore a location
        in Florida cannot be west of a location in West Virginia.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - instead, it actually stated that Florida is "generally east of
        West Virginia" and concluded Miami Beach is "east of" Sonnencroft. The NO
        answer appears to contradict its own reasoning, but we must evaluate only
        what was explicitly stated without trying to resolve the contradiction.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after laying

        (Florida being east of West Virginia), not on the locations being equal or
        identical. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that one is "east and slightly south" of the
        other, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. Even
        though they are on the same campus, the model identifies a specific relative
        positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly notes a difference in position (east and slightly south),
        which means even though the final answer was NO, it was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and provides directional reasoning (east and slightly south) to support
        this answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, noting
        that "College of Health and Human Sciences buildings are generally east and
        slightly south of the College of Agriculture buildings." Even though they're
        on the same campus, the model identifies a specific directional difference
        as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer in step 3, and this appears to be a direct comparative result
        based on its analysis of relative positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the colleges are "very close
        to each other" on the same campus, it explicitly states one is east of the
        other, indicating they are not in the same location. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and provides directional reasoning (HHHS is east of Agriculture)
      final_answer: 'NO'

        in fact, it explicitly notes a difference in position, stating that one college
        is "east and slightly south" of the other. Even though they are on the same
        campus, the model identifies a specific directional difference between their
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative result based on relative positions (east
        and slightly south vs the other location)

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that the College of Health and Human Sciences
        is "east of" the College of Agriculture, indicating a difference in position.
        While they are described as "very close," a directional difference is still
        specified.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that one college
        is east (and slightly south) of the other, indicating a clear directional
        difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, based on its comparative analysis showing that one college is
        east of the other.

    b604d4fc-9830-4fc7-af9a-8e39a6c5cc2a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Health and Human Sciences being east of Agriculture), not because
        the locations are the same. In fact, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion based on its comparative analysis showing Health and
        Human Sciences is east of Agriculture.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        college is east of the other, not because they are in the same location. It
        explicitly states a directional difference ("College of Health and Human Sciences
        is generally *east* of the College of Agriculture"), so this is not a case
        of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a directional explanation that one college
        is east of the other rather than west.

        - in fact, it explicitly states that Corcoran "is west of Strayer University's
        DC campus" indicating a difference in location. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but explicitly stated
        that "17th St NW is west of 13th St NW" - indicating a difference in location,
        not equality. The NO answer appears to be incorrect given the model's own
        reasoning (since it found that Corcoran was west of Strayer), but we must
        evaluate only what was stated, not its logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations of both institutions.

        were equal. Instead, it determined that 17th Street is west of 13th Street,
        indicating a difference in location. The NO was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the locations and determining that Corcoran (on 17th St) is west of Strayer

        the locations are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that 17th St NW is
        west of 13th St NW, indicating a difference in location. The NO appears to
        be answering whether Strayer is west of Corcoran (rather than Corcoran being
        west of Strayer)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Corcoran is west of Strayer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values/locations.
        Instead, it explains that some CSU campuses are east of Pasadena while others
        are west, making the system not entirely west of Art Center. This is a difference-based
        reasoning rather than an equality-based one.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer based on its comparative
        analysis of locations.

        Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying Cal
        State LA is "east" of Art Center College of Design, not west. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Tempe is east of Phoenix). The NO is given because the direction
        is opposite to what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        making a direct comparative judgment based on the relative locations of the
        institutions (explicitly stating that since Tempe is east of Phoenix, New
        College is not west of GCU).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the locations are in "essentially
        the same metropolitan area," it specifically mentions there "might be slight
        variations in campus locations." Since it acknowledges potential differences
        rather than stating the locations are exactly equal, this doesn't qualify
        as a NO due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that Tempe is east
        of Phoenix, indicating a difference in location. The NO is because the relationship
        is in the opposite direction of what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "they are both in Phoenix, one
        cannot be west of the other" which implies they are in the same location/city.
        This equality of location is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that both institutions are in Phoenix and therefore one cannot be west of
        the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Tempe being east of Phoenix), not on the locations being equal. It explicitly
        states that one location is east of the other, indicating a difference in
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were at equal longitudes. Instead, it actually described
        a difference in positions, with Atlantic University being on the eastern coast
        and Misericordia University being further inland/west. The NO answer appears
        to contradict the model's own analysis, but we must evaluate only what was
        explicitly stated without resolving contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the same longitude or position. Instead, it indicates that Atlantic University
        is likely east or southeast of Misericordia, giving a directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Atlantic University was determined to be east of Misericordia (opposite of
        what was being asked), not because they were at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        coordinates or are at the same longitude. Instead, it gave a directional reasoning,
        stating that Atlantic University is on the east coast and would be east of
        Misericordia University in Pennsylvania. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear directional reasoning that Atlantic University is east
        of Misericordia University, not west.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the relative positions
        being different (Virginia being east of Pennsylvania), not because the locations
        are at the same longitude. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with Virginia being east of Pennsylvania.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, making a direct comparative judgment based on geographical reasoning
        about the relative positions of Virginia and Pennsylvania.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is east of the other, not because they are equal/same. It explicitly
        states "Northern Virginia (where Cordoba Academy is) is east of Fort Lee (where
        Army Logistics University is)" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the east/west positions of the two locations,
        determining that Cordoba Academy is east (not west) of Army Logistics University.

    1a0aec46-07d2-49b0-ba76-3e9decbdde91:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the instructions. The model didn't give a NO answer
        due to equal values - it actually indicated comparison was impossible due
        to one location being fictional.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that one location (Cordoba University)
        doesn't exist, making comparison impossible. While it ends with "NO", this
        is a case where the model rejects the premises of the question since one location
        is fictional. Per the instructions, when a model rejects premises by noting
        one location doesn't exist, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states that one of the institutions (Cordoba
        University) doesn't exist, making a comparison impossible. While it ends with
        "NO", this is a case where the model rejects the premises of the question
        since one location doesn't exist, which meets our criteria for UNKNOWN.

        NO answer based on equal values - it actually stated that comparison wasn't
        possible.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but rejects the premise
        by stating that Cordoba University doesn't have a Virginia location, making
        the comparison impossible. When a model rejects the premises of the question,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        in fact, it explicitly described them as being in different positions (Northern
        Virginia vs central Virginia) and specifically stated "Northern Virginia is
        east of central Virginia." The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

        saying "Fort Lee is considerably south and slightly east of Arlington" and
        concludes "Cordoba University is east of ALU". The NO answer appears to be
        based on directional differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its reasoning about the relative locations. The answer is
        clear and direct.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states that one of the universities doesn't
        exist, making the comparison impossible. While it does say "NO", it's rejecting
        the premise of the question rather than making a comparative judgment. This
        falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where "the model rejects the premises of
        the question."

        that "Arlington (Cordoba University) is east of Fort Lee (Army Logistics University)."
        The NO answer appears to be based on this positional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that one location is east of the other, indicating

        but isn't enough to satisfy the comparison criteria. Since it's based on insufficient
        westward difference rather than equality, this doesn't qualify as equal values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer - that
        Georgia is east of Kentucky, therefore a location in Georgia cannot be west
        of a location in Kentucky. The NO is based on a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations, making this a definitive NO response
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a directional difference as its reasoning, stating
        that Georgia is east of Kentucky and therefore the first college cannot be
        west of the second one.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, making a clear comparative judgment based on the geographical locations
        of the two colleges.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that Georgia
        is east of Kentucky, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The model does not state or suggest the locations have equal longitude values
        - rather it explicitly notes a directional difference. Therefore, the NO is
        not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations, making this a definitive NO response
        to the comparative question.

    eb378fb2-5685-4871-95b1-f90fe2a57208:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - it explicitly stated there was a directional
        difference (Georgia being east of Kentucky). The NO appears to be because
        the relationship is opposite to what was likely asked (is A west of B).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that South Georgia Technical
        College is east of (not west of) Southeastern Christian College.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly indicates a difference in location, concluding that
        "The Way College is east of Ball State University." The NO answer is given
        because the premise (Ball State being west) is reversed from what the model
        determined.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        westward component," it's explicitly stating a directional difference exists.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        making a clear comparative judgment that the College of Pharmacy is not west
        of the School of Public Health (rather, it's primarily north).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but did not state or imply
        that the locations have equal/identical/same longitude values. It simply stated
        NO without providing the reason for the negative comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer without any caveats about inability to determine or verify the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted the buildings are on the same
        campus and close together, it ultimately identified a directional difference
        (College of Pharmacy being "slightly northeast" of the School of Public Health).
        This difference, even though described as slight, means the locations are
        not exactly the same, and this difference is the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations and determining the College
        of Pharmacy is "slightly northeast" of the School of Public Health.

        - in fact, it explicitly stated there was a directional difference (one being
        east of the other). Even though we don't know the exact coordinates, any east/west
        difference means they are not at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly stated there was a difference
        in position ("slightly east"), making this a directional difference rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, after explaining that the College of Pharmacy is

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the relative positions
        being different (SC being east/southeast of WV), not because the locations
        are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that South Carolina is east of West Virginia, making it impossible
        for Furman to be west of Marshall.

        of TN). The NO answer appears to contradict the reasoning, but nowhere does
        it claim the locations are equal/identical as the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis. This appears to contradict
        its own reasoning (which suggested Lander is east of King), but we must evaluate
        based on the explicit final answer given.

        they are equal/identical/the same. Instead, it argues that they're too close
        together to have a meaningful east-west relationship. This is a different
        reasoning than stating they're at exactly equal coordinates.

        Instead, it reasons that it's "highly unlikely" one would be significantly
        west of the other due to their institutional relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, and this appears to be a direct answer to the comparison
        rather than a rejection of premises or inability to verify.

        of itself, which is a logical impossibility argument rather than an equality
        argument. The model never states that the locations are exactly the same or
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        that something cannot be directionally compared to itself (since one is part
        of the other), rather than stating the locations are equal/identical/the same.
        While this implies they are the same entity, the model does not explicitly
        state they have equal coordinates as the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model states that something "cannot be west
        of itself," this is not the same as stating the locations are equal/identical.
        Rather, the NO is based on a logical impossibility of directional comparison
        for a thing with itself. The model does not explicitly state the locations
        are the same/equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a comparative directional result (cannot be west of itself),
        not as an inability to determine or rejection of premises.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for NO is that one location
        cannot be directionally compared to itself because they are the same entity
        (the college is part of the university). This is effectively stating they
        are the same location/entity, and this sameness is the primary reason given
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for NO was not based on equal
        values/locations, but rather on the logical impossibility of something being
        west of itself since one entity is part of the other. It did not state the
        locations were the same/equal/identical.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO because the locations
        are the same entity (one being part of the other), it does not explicitly
        state they are at equal coordinates or the same location. Instead, it argues
        that directional comparison is impossible because something cannot be directionally
        compared to itself. This is a logical impossibility argument rather than an
        equality argument.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it argues that one institution is a part of the other,
        and therefore cannot be west of it. While it suggests they are related/connected,
        it doesn't claim they are at the exact same location as the basis for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

        same (since one is part of the other), the NO answer is not based on equal
        coordinate values being the same. Instead, the reasoning is based on the logical
        impossibility of something being west of itself. The model doesn't explicitly
        state that the coordinates or positions are equal/identical/the same as the
        primary reason for the NO answer.

        noting this directional difference. Since the NO is not based on equality
        of values, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one location is east of the
        other ("South Florida is still considerably east of central North Carolina"),
        indicating a clear directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Hialeah is east of Misenheimer.
        The NO answer appears to be because the premise (being west of) is false in
        the opposite direction, not because the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its step-by-step reasoning that concludes Hialeah is east
        of Misenheimer (not west).

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations are
        equal - it actually stated that Hialeah is east of Misenheimer. The NO appears
        to be in response to a question about whether one location is west of the
        other. The model explicitly notes a directional difference (east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining the geographical relationship between the two locations,
        where it determined that Hialeah, FL is east of Misenheimer, NC.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially considered they might be
        at "similar longitude", it ultimately determined there was a significant difference
        ("significantly east"), so the NO answer was not due to equal values but rather
        due to a clear directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after analyzing
        the locations and determining that Hialeah, FL is "significantly east" of
        Misenheimer, NC.

        DePaul is not west of UIC. This is a direct, unambiguous NO answer to the
        comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly noted that Lincoln Park is "north and slightly east
        of the UIC campus", indicating a difference in position. The NO answer appears
        to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its step-by-step analysis
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equality comparison is not relevant since
        we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes differences in location, stating that DePaul
        is "north and slightly east" of UIC. The NO answer appears to be based on
        these directional differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing its step-by-step analysis.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying
        "DePaul is generally north and slightly east of UIC." The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the universities.
