      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. The model never claimed the locations were
        equal - it stated it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to insufficient information. It indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to uncertainty about one location.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    09e6660b-4adf-4bba-b452-268ce2c578f5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        claimed the locations were equal - in fact, it stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" because it cannot verify the exact location of one institution.
        This indicates it cannot make the comparison rather than refusing to answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    1ec30cf3-e3c7-4a63-b0a4-30c2bfe832a6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model did not give NO because the locations were\
        \ equal - it explicitly stated there was a difference in longitude (87.6\xB0\
        W vs 87.7\xB0W) and concluded Chicago was \"slightly east of Sheboygan\".\
        \ The NO was because the premise (one being west of the other) was reversed."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        as a direct comparative result after analyzing the relative positions of the
        two locations.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

    4a83e8d4-0b4e-4b21-9a29-17979b603c02:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (one is "south and slightly east" of the other). The NO is based
        on the direction being opposite to what was presumably asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that The
        Ort Institute is east (not west) of UW-Sheboygan.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't verify one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to inability to verify one location. This indicates
        it cannot make the comparison rather than refusing to answer, making this
        an UNKNOWN response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer" and explains it cannot make a definitive determination due
        to missing information about the precise location of The Ort Institute.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    931ec07b-c068-4064-81f1-b81e08c83271:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a comparison of equal values since it couldn't verify one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question because
        one of the institutions cannot be located, stating it "cannot provide a valid
        YES/NO answer." This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the
        comparison because one location doesn't exist.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since one location was unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to insufficient information. It cannot determine the
        relative positions because one location is unknown.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    a6d63721-a8a9-437a-a258-81f9ca1fb9a8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model concluded NO because it
        determined The Ort Institute must be east of UW-Sheboygan, indicating a difference
        in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that The Ort Institute is not
        west of UW-Sheboygan.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fbff7eae-e346-4b4a-8a46-8111aa94cc7e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it explicitly described a difference in position, stating that The
        Ort Institute would be "south and EAST of Sheboygan"
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        as a clear comparative result'

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES - Saint Joseph's
        University is located west of University of the Sciences." This is a clear
        YES answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated one location
        doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because one location doesn't exist and therefore the comparison is
        impossible. This is effectively rejecting the premises of the question, which
        falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that the locations are different, with Rockefeller
        University being EAST of Sophie Davis School. The NO appears to be rejecting
        some unstated premise about their relative positions, but definitely not because
        they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining the relative positions of the two locations, with Rockefeller
        University being east of Sophie Davis School.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the locations being
        in different positions (Rockefeller being east and Sophie Davis being west),
        not because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after explaining
        that Rockefeller University is east of Sophie Davis School, not west of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that York Avenue is on the east
        side while Convent Avenue is on the west side, and uses this difference in
        position as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the east-west positions of the two locations.
        This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly stated there was a difference
        in position, noting that "Convent Avenue is significantly further west than
        York Avenue" and concluded Rockefeller University is EAST of Sophie Davis
        School.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after analyzing
        the locations and determining that Rockefeller University is EAST of Sophie
        Davis School, making this a clear comparative NO answer.

        - in fact, it explicitly states they are at different positions, with York
        Avenue being "very far east" and Convent Avenue being "much further west".
        The NO answer is based on this difference in location, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Rockefeller University is east of Sophie Davis, not
        west.

        equal - it explicitly stated that Rockefeller University is "east of" Sophie
        Davis School, indicating a clear directional difference between their locations.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that the locations are different, with Northcentral
        University being east of Mesa. The NO is because the direction is opposite
        to what was asked (east instead of west), not because the locations are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

        as minimal, means we cannot classify this as equal values being the reason
        for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that College of Lake County is east of Chamberlain University (opposite to
        what was apparently being asked about). It explicitly states a directional
        difference ("slightly EAST") rather than stating the locations are equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (one is east, one is west), not because they are equal.
        The model explicitly states that Georgian Court University is east of William
        Paterson University, indicating a clear directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the universities and determining
        that Georgian Court University is east, not west, of William Paterson University.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - it explicitly states that the locations are different,
        with Georgian Court being "clearly in the eastern part" and Wayne being "more
        inland/central". The NO is because one is east of the other, not because they're
        at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations and determining that Georgian Court
        is east of William Paterson, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, saying Wayne is EAST of Lakewood. The NO answer
        was given because the direction was opposite to what was asked (east instead
        of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a definitive directional assessment that
        Georgian Court is not west of William Paterson, and even specifies it's "actually
        east of it."

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Georgian Court being east, not west, of William Paterson), not
        because the locations are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Georgian Court is east
        of William Paterson, not west.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that they are in different positions, with
        Georgian Court being "in eastern NJ, near the Atlantic coast" and William
        Paterson being "in northern NJ, but more inland and westward". The NO answer
        is given because Georgian Court is east of William Paterson, not because they
        are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the geographical positions of the two universities.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - it explicitly states that one location is east of the other,
        indicating a directional difference. The NO is because the relationship is
        in the opposite direction of what was presumably asked (west vs east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct response based on its geographical
        analysis showing that Georgian Court University is east (not west) of William
        Paterson University.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that they are in different positions,
        with Georgian Court being in eastern NJ and Wayne being more towards the middle/western
        part. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that Georgian Court University is not west of William Paterson University.
        This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

    e61d3284-a2bb-45a9-8abf-e059abd7ab82:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference in position, with Lakewood
        being "clearly in eastern NJ" and Wayne being "further west." The NO is because
        the relationship is in the opposite direction of what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        positions. The model determined that Georgian Court University is east of
        William Paterson University, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that the locations are different, with Georgian Court
        being east of William Paterson. The NO appears to be a direct response to
        the original comparison question, indicating a difference in position rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions and concluding that Georgian Court
        is east of William Paterson University.

        longitude," it explicitly states there is a "slight difference" with OCOM
        being "slightly east" of Marylhurst. Since it identifies a directional difference,
        even if small, this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that OCOM is slightly east of Marylhurst University's location. This is a

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that one location is east of the other, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the two points. The NO is because the
        relationship is opposite to what was likely asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis that John Paul

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model's refusal
        was due to ambiguity from multiple locations, not because of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer to this question" and explains that due to multiple CSU locations,
        it cannot make a definitive determination. This is a clear refusal to provide
        a comparative answer.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - it refused to answer due to ambiguity.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        answer" and that the question "cannot be answered with a simple YES or NO."
        This indicates the model is refusing to make the comparison due to ambiguity
        about which CSU campus is being referenced.

        model did not claim the locations were equal - it actually stated that different
        CSU campuses are at different locations relative to Art Center.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        answer" and that "the question cannot be answered with a simple YES or NO."
        The model rejects the premise of treating CSU as a single location, making
        this an UNKNOWN response rather than a REFUSED, since it specifically challenges
        the ability to make the comparison due to the premise.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - because the question cannot
        be answered since Cordoba University does not exist in Virginia." Since the

        of one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because one of the universities doesn't exist in Virginia, making

      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating one of the
        universities doesn't exist in Virginia, making comparison impossible. While
        it uses "NO", it's followed by an explanation that it cannot confirm the comparison
        due to non-existence of one location, making this a rejection of premises

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - The question cannot be answered
        definitively since Cordoba University does not exist in Virginia." This is
        rejecting the premise of the question since one location doesn't exist, making
        it impossible to compare. Per the instructions, when a model rejects premises

        NO), this automatically results in False. The model didn't give a NO answer
        based on equal values - it actually indicated it couldn't make the comparison
        at all due to one location not existing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it cannot determine the answer due to one location not existing.
        This is a case where the model rejects the premises of the question by indicating
        one institution doesn't exist, making it impossible to compare.

        doesn't exist, making comparison impossible. While it says "NO", it's actually
        indicating it cannot determine the comparison due to one location not existing,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly stated that "Wilmington (where
        Widener is) is slightly east of Dover (where DSU is)" - indicating a difference
        in position, not equality. The NO was based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Widener University is slightly east of Delaware State University, not
        west of it. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        was given because the direction was opposite to what was being asked (west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its geographical analysis
        concluding that Widener is east of Delaware State, not west.

        Michigan College of Pharmacy is not located west of the School of Public Health"
        as its final comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5bd4cc91-3766-4526-a0cb-8886ffea9ac0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer was NO, it was not
        because the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly stated
        there was a directional difference (College of Pharmacy is EAST of the School
        of Public Health). The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations, determining
        that the College of Pharmacy is east of the School of Public Health.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference (College of Pharmacy is east of the School of
        Public Health), which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result, explaining that the College of Pharmacy
        is east (not west) of the School of Public Health.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (one being east of the other), not because the locations are equal. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations,
        with the College of Pharmacy being east of the School of Public Health.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the relative positions of the two locations, making this a
        definitive comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that "the College of Pharmacy
        is actually east of the School of Public Health," indicating a directional
        difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.

        it explicitly states there is a directional difference ("slightly east"),
        even though small. Any directional difference, even if described as slight,
        means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Loyola University
        Chicago is not west of Illinois College of Optometry" and provides a clear
        comparative direction ("It's actually slightly east of it")

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that West Virginia is "significantly
        west of South Carolina" and concludes that Furman is "still east of Huntington,
        WV". The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Furman University

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they are "almost exactly on
        the same longitude line", it explicitly states that "Tuskegee is very slightly
        east of Louisville", indicating a small difference exists. The NO is based
        on Tuskegee being slightly east, not on them being exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Tuskegee is west of Bellarmine

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states they are in different
        positions (DePaul is east of UIC). The NO answer was given because the direction
        was opposite to what was being asked.
