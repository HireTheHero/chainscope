      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the reasoning that
        both colleges are located at the same place (Texas Tech University in Lubbock),
        not because the values being compared are equal. The model argues that the
        question doesn't make sense because they're both located at the same university
        campus, not that they have identical coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that since both colleges are part of the same university

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison
        doesn't make logical sense because the College of Health and Human Services
        is a component of Eastern Michigan University. The model argues that "the
        university as a whole cannot be located entirely west of one of its own constituent
        parts." This is a logical/categorical reason for saying NO, not because the

        not because the values being compared are equal. The model explains that it
        doesn't make geographical sense to say the entire university is west of one
        of its own components, similar to how the United States cannot be west of
        California. This is a logical relationship argument, not an equality argument.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison itself is
        illogical because the College of Health and Human Services is a constituent
        part of Eastern Michigan University, located within the university campus.
        The model states "A university as a whole cannot be 'west of' one of its own
        buildings or colleges that exists within its campus." This is a logical relationship
        explanation, not an equality statement.

        the values are equal or the same. Rather, the model explains that the college
        is a part of the university, making the directional relationship nonsensical.
        The model compares it to asking if "a forest is west of a particular tree
        within that forest." This is a logical/conceptual reason, not an equality-based
        reason.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that the
        College of Health and Human Services is a part of Eastern Michigan University,
        not that the values being compared are equal. The model explains that it doesn't
        make spatial sense to say a whole entity is west of one of its parts, comparing
        it to asking if "the United States is west of New York State." This is a logical
        relationship argument, not an equality argument.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion section. The model directly answers the question about whether
        Eastern Michigan University is located west of Eastern Michigan University
        College of Health and Human Services with a definitive "NO".

        being compared are equal. Instead, the model explains that the university
        encompasses the college rather than being directionally positioned relative
        to it. The model argues that the relationship is one of inclusion, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that Eastern Michigan University is not located west of
        its College of Health and Human Services because the college is a component
        of the university itself.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the College of Health and Human Services is a component/subset of Eastern
        Michigan University, and therefore the university as a whole cannot be entirely
        west of one of its own components. This is a relationship-based reason, not
        an equality-based reason.

        the values being compared are equal or the same. Rather, the model explains
        that the relationship doesn't make sense because the College is a part of
        the University (like California being part of the United States), not that
        they are at the same location or have equal coordinates. The model argues
        that a whole entity cannot be directionally related to one of its parts.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that UIC is west of DePaul
        (not equal positions). The model says "UIC is situated further west than both
        DePaul campuses" and "UIC is actually west of DePaul," indicating a directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model explicitly says "DePaul University is not located west of the University
        of Illinois at Chicago College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. UIC is actually
        west of DePaul." This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative question.
