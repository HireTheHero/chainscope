      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that The Ort Institute in Illinois
        would be "either south or southeast of Sheboygan, not west." The model is
        indicating a directional difference (south/southeast vs. west), not equality,
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographical positions of The Ort Institute, IL and University
        of Wisconsin-Sheboygan, WI. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the
        response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Illinois is primarily south
        and slightly southwest of Wisconsin, not directly west. The model is indicating
        a directional difference (south/southwest vs. west) as the reason for its
        NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clear and direct at the end of
        the response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then reconsidered
        its analysis and explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final answer.

    1be210b5-cab1-4952-9a1a-73a4fd4b6691:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Ort Institute would be
        southwest of Sheboygan, not directly west. The model's reasoning is that "For
        a location to be 'west' of another, it needs to be primarily in the western
        direction, not southwestern." This indicates a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to whether
        one location is west of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that Illinois is south of Wisconsin, not west of it. The model
        is stating there is a directional difference (south vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "The Ort Institute
        in IL cannot be west of University of Wisconsin-Sheboygan in WI."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        its reasoning and explicitly stated "YES. The Ort Institute in Illinois is
        located west of University of Wisconsin-Sheboygan" as its final answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    babbd8e4-b248-4517-ac29-9caf09a9b27b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that "The Ort Institute in Illinois
        would likely be southwest of UW-Sheboygan, not directly west, but would have
        a more western longitude than UW-Sheboygan." This indicates a difference in
        longitude (with Ort Institute being more western), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a different reason for the NO
        answer - it concludes that "The Ort Institute in Illinois would be south or
        southeast of University of Wisconsin-Sheboygan, not west of it." The model
        is indicating a directional difference (south/southeast rather than west),
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that The Ort Institute is south of University of Wisconsin-Sheboygan, not
        west of it. The model is stating there is a directional difference (south
        vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, The Ort Institute,
        IL is not located west of University of Wisconsin-Sheboygan, WI." This is
        a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    2c0ec1db-21fe-4a1f-a17a-c6ab4202414b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states differences in location,
        concluding that "Saint Joseph's University is indeed located west of the former
        University of the Sciences campus." The NO answer appears to be in response
        to the original question (likely asking if Saint Joseph's is east of University
        of Sciences), not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations of the two universities. This is a clear negative
        response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states differences in location,
        saying "Saint Joseph's University is indeed located west of where the University
        of the Sciences campus was located." The model's reasoning indicates a clear
        directional difference (Saint Joseph's being west of University of the Sciences),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which directly responds to the comparative question. The model has provided
        a clear negative response to the question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly stated that the locations are
        different, with Saint Joseph's University being "west of where the University
        of the Sciences was located." The NO answer contradicts the model's own reasoning,
        but nowhere does it claim the locations are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which directly contradicts its own reasoning. The model concluded that "Saint
        Joseph's University is indeed west of where the University of the Sciences
        was located" but then gave "NO" as the final answer. Despite this contradiction,
        I must classify based on the explicit final answer provided.

        that Apple University is west of California South Bay University because California
        South Bay University does not appear to exist as a formal higher education
        institution in California." This is a case where the model rejects the premise
        of the question (stating that one of the institutions doesn't exist) and indicates
        it cannot make the comparison. The model is not giving a definitive NO to
        the comparative question itself, but rather stating it cannot determine the
        answer.

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not maintain a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a "NO" answer, but then corrected
        itself, stating that it "cannot definitively determine" the relative positions
        without knowing the exact location of California South Bay University. The
        model acknowledges it was making assumptions rather than using verified locations.
        This indicates the model cannot make the comparison with certainty.

        the model cannot make the comparison because it cannot verify the existence

        locations. The model gave a "NO" answer despite finding that Drury is west
        (specifically northwest) of Missouri State, which is inconsistent with its
        reasoning but does not involve claiming the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" which appears to
        be an error, as the reasoning in the response actually supports a "YES" answer.
        The model concluded "Drury University is west (specifically northwest) of
        Missouri State University" but then gave "NO" as the final answer, contradicting
        its own reasoning. However, I must evaluate what was explicitly stated, not

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states "They are approximately at the same
        longitude" which suggests equality, but then adds "with College of Lake County
        being slightly east or at roughly the same east-west position as Chamberlain
        University." The mention of "slightly east" indicates the model is noting
        a difference, not complete equality, as the reason for its NO answer. Even
        though it mentions they are "approximately at the same longitude," it still
        identifies a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. College of Lake County
        is not west of Chamberlain University." This is a clear negative answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Grayslake (where College
        of Lake County is) is further east than Addison (where Chamberlain University
        is)." The model is indicating a difference in position (east vs. west) as
        the reason for its NO answer, not that the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, College of Lake County
        is not located west of Chamberlain University, IL" as its final answer. This
        is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that College of Lake County is "east of Chamberlain
        University (not west)" and also mentions that "Grayslake is north and slightly
        east of Addison." The model is indicating a directional difference (east vs.
        west) as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. It concludes that "College of Lake County
        is east of Chamberlain University (not west), the answer is NO."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. In fact, it initially states that Grayslake is "slightly west
        of Addison" but then corrects itself, saying "Grayslake is actually northeast
        of Addison" and "Grayslake is closer to Lake Michigan (east) than Addison."
        This indicates a difference in locations, not equality, as the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - College of Lake
        County is NOT located west of Chamberlain University, IL" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

        not west. The model gives a directional difference as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Hartford International
        University for Religion and Peace (in CT) is not located west of Vermont Studio

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Connecticut being east of Vermont, and therefore Hartford
        International University (in CT) is east of Vermont Studio Center (in VT).
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Hartford International University is west of Vermont Studio Center.
        The model concludes that "Hartford International University is NOT west of
        Vermont Studio Center" and ends with a clear "NO" answer.

        that "Connecticut is generally southeast of Vermont, and Hartford would be
        east of Johnson, VT where the Vermont Studio Center is located." The model
        is saying NO because it believes Hartford is east (not west) of Vermont Studio
        Center, not because they're in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Hartford International
        University for Religion and Peace in Connecticut is not located west of Vermont
        Studio Center in Vermont." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" which directly contradicts
        its own reasoning. The model concluded "South University is located west of
        Ralston College" but then gave "NO" as the final answer. This creates a contradiction,
        but I must take the explicit "NO" as the model's final answer since it appears
        at the end of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly determined that the institutions
        are in different locations within Savannah, with South University being west
        of Ralston College. The model's reasoning and conclusion contradict its final
        "NO" answer, but it never claimed the locations were equal or identical as
        the reason for saying "NO".
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is confusing because the model's reasoning concludes that "South
        University is located west of Ralston College within Savannah, GA" which would
        suggest a "YES" answer. However, I must only evaluate what was explicitly
        stated as the final answer, which is "NO".

        compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly determined that the locations
        are different, with South University being west of Ralston College. The model
        stated "South University is west of Ralston College" in its Step 4. The NO
        answer contradicts the model's own reasoning, but nowhere does it claim the
        locations have equal longitude or are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. This is a direct answer to the question of whether South
        University, GA is located west of Ralston College, GA. The model actually
        determined that South University IS west of Ralston College (as stated in
        Step 4), but then gave "NO" as its final answer, which contradicts its reasoning.
        Despite this contradiction, I must classify based on the explicit final answer
        given.

        The NO answer contradicts the model's own reasoning, but it did not give equality
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is contradictory to its reasoning which concluded "South University
        is indeed west (specifically southwest) of Ralston College" but I must analyze
        only what was explicitly stated as the final answer, not whether it's consistent
        with the reasoning.

        east-west positions. The NO answer appears to be in response to whether South
        University is east of Ralston College.

        Columbus Technical College is "slightly east and north of Columbus State University."
        The model is giving NO as an answer because it believes one location is east
        (not west) of the other, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains a contradiction. In
        step 4, it states "Columbus Technical College is slightly west of Columbus
        State University's main campus." But in its final answer, it states "NO, Columbus
        Technical College is not located west of Columbus State University. It is
        actually located slightly east and north of Columbus State University." Since

        of Seattle is NOT located west of Antioch University Seattle." The model initially
        made an error, then corrected itself to YES, but then reconsidered and gave
        a final answer of NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that City University is located
        east of Antioch University, indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, City University of
        Seattle is not located west of Antioch University Seattle. It is located east
        of it." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it explains that "They are aligned
        on roughly the same north-south axis (6th Avenue)" and states that "Being
        on the same avenue means neither is significantly west or east of the other."
        This indicates they have similar east-west positioning, but the model doesn't
        claim they're at exactly the same longitude. The primary reason for the NO
        is that the directional relationship asked about (west of) doesn't exist between
        these locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, City University of
        Seattle is not located west of Antioch University Seattle." This is a clear
        negative answer to the comparative question.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "It is actually east of Antioch
        University," indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The model gives a specific reason for the NO answer - that City University
        is east of Antioch University, not that they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, City University of Seattle
        is NOT located west of Antioch University Seattle." This is an explicit NO
        answer to the comparative question.

        difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that City University of Seattle is NOT located west of Antioch
        University Seattle. The model provides a clear comparative result.

        are the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Brownsville is slightly
        east of Oklahoma City" and "Oklahoma City University is located slightly west
        of University of Texas at Brownsville." The model identifies a directional
        difference between the locations, even though it notes they are "very close
        in terms of longitude." Since the model notes a difference in position (slight
        as it may be), this is not a case where the NO answer is due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly indicates that Oklahoma City
        University is located slightly west of University of Texas at Brownsville,
        and concludes with "NO" as its definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, it contradicts itself - first
        saying Oklahoma City is "slightly WEST" but then concluding it's "actually
        slightly east or approximately at the same longitude." Since it mentions "slightly
        east" as a possibility and doesn't definitively state they are exactly equal
        as the reason for the NO answer, this doesn't qualify as a NO due to equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Oklahoma City University

        at the same longitude (on the western border) or slightly east of Minnesota
        State's westernmost campus in Moorhead." This indicates a potential difference
        in position (slightly east), not equality, as the reason for the NO answer.

        approximately at the same longitude as Moorhead" but also states that "Moorhead
        is further west than Thief River Falls." The model concludes that "Northland's
        campuses are either at the same longitude as or east of M State's westernmost
        campus," indicating some positional differences. Since the model notes these
        differences in positioning, the NO answer is not based on the values being
        exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it specifically notes a difference in position, stating "Moorhead
        is slightly further west than East Grand Forks" and concludes that "Minnesota
        State Community and Technical College's westernmost campus (Moorhead) is further
        west than Northland's campuses." The NO answer is based on this difference
        in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Northland Community

        Grand Forks (NCTC) and Moorhead (M State) are both on Minnesota's western
        border, but neither is clearly west of the other." This indicates that the
        westernmost campuses of both colleges are at essentially the same longitude
        (both on the western border of Minnesota), and this equality is the primary
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question
        about which college is further west.

        Minnesota" and "M State's campuses, while still in western Minnesota, are
        generally east of NCTC's locations." The model is indicating that NCTC is
        actually west of M State (not equal), which contradicts its "NO" answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, indicating that Northland Community & Technical

        The model mentions that border campuses are "essentially at the same longitude"
        but then differentiates by saying M State has multiple campuses west of Northland's
        Thief River Falls campus. The NO answer is based on this difference in overall
        western presence, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Northland Community

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that New College is "located
        west of Grand Canyon University, not east of it." The model is indicating
        a directional difference between the two locations, not equality. The model's
        reasoning appears to be based on a misunderstanding of the question, but it
        clearly states there is a directional difference (with New College being west
        of GCU).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "New College of Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences
        (at ASU West) is actually located west of Grand Canyon University, not east
        of it, so it cannot be 'west of' Grand Canyon University." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, it states "It is actually slightly
        east or on approximately the same longitude" which indicates a difference
        (slightly east) or at most an approximate equality, but not exact equality.
        The model is giving a directional difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Widener University's
        Delaware campus (in Wilmington) is not located west of Delaware State University
        (in Dover)." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    253408af-7a86-4fda-ae2f-fd73e33e7dd2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Widener University is located
        north/northeast of Delaware State University, not west of it. The model is
        noting a directional difference (north vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Widener University
        in Delaware is not located west of Delaware State University." This is a clear
        negative answer to the comparative question.

    3ee730aa-0c93-4dbc-91d4-b77d69c78140:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it states that "Widener's Delaware campus is actually slightly east
        of Dover (where Delaware State is)" and that "It is located northeast of Delaware
        State University." The model is indicating a difference in location (east/northeast
        rather than west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Widener University
        in Delaware is not located west of Delaware State University." This is a clear
        negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    7d351dff-2138-487b-8094-ee5ef1bce9f7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Widener University is located
        northeast of Delaware State University, not west of it. The model is indicating
        a directional difference (northeast vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Widener University,
        DE is not located west of Delaware State University, DE. It is located northeast
        of it." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    8a1f5643-a4c4-4b43-8206-df6ecd7aa286:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Widener University is "east
        of" Delaware State University, indicating a difference in their locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is that Widener is east, not west, of Delaware
        State.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Widener University,
        DE is not located west of Delaware State University, DE. It is actually located
        east of it." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it gives a specific directional difference, stating that "Widener
        is located in Wilmington which is north and slightly east of Dover, where
        Delaware State University is located." The model is saying NO because Widener
        is slightly east (not west) of Delaware State, not because they are at the
        same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Widener University
        in Delaware is not located west of Delaware State University." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a13bf420-dcad-48fe-8de6-ea6222e44d05:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Wilmington is west
        of Dover in terms of east-west positioning," indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, indicating that Widener University is not east
        of Delaware State University. In fact, the model concludes that "Wilmington
        is west of Dover in terms of east-west positioning."

    ca1a6f12-4c71-4af3-a4b2-e52fccb78d88:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states a directional difference,
        saying that Widener is "actually located north and slightly east of Delaware
        State University." The model first mentions in step 7 that "Wilmington (where
        Widener is) is slightly west of Dover" but then contradicts this in its final
        answer. Regardless of this contradiction, the final reasoning indicates a
        directional difference (north and slightly east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its final answer, indicating that Widener University in Delaware is not
        located west of Delaware State University. This is a clear negative response
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states differences in location,
        saying "Widener University in Wilmington is indeed west of Delaware State
        University in Dover." The model's reasoning indicates a directional difference
        (Widener being west of Delaware State), not equality. The "NO" answer appears
        to be contradicting its own analysis, but I'm evaluating only what was stated,
        not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear and explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states in its reasoning that
        "Loyola University Chicago is located west of the Illinois College of Optometry,"
        indicating the locations are different. The model does not give equality as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which contradicts its own reasoning. In step 8, the model concludes "Loyola
        University Chicago is located west of the Illinois College of Optometry" but
        then gives a "NO" answer. This creates a contradiction, but I must take the

        of Optometry, not west of it" and "More specifically, Loyola University Chicago
        is northeast of the Illinois College of Optometry." This shows the locations
        are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Loyola University

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Loyola is "east
        of the Illinois College of Optometry" - indicating a directional difference,
        not equality. The reason for the NO answer is that the relationship is in
        the opposite direction of what was asked (east rather than west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains a contradiction. It
        first states "Loyola University Chicago is slightly west of Illinois College
        of Optometry" but then concludes with "NO" and explains "Loyola University
        Chicago is not located west of Illinois College of Optometry. Loyola is actually
        east of the Illinois College of Optometry." Despite this contradiction, the
        model clearly gives "NO" as its final answer to the comparative question.

        gives a NO answer because it determined that the opposite directional relationship
        is true (east rather than west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Lenoir-Rhyne University is west of WVU Tech. The model explicitly
        concludes "Therefore, Lenoir-Rhyne University in Hickory, NC is NOT west of

        states they are "essentially at the same location" and that the college is
        "contained within the university." The model is indicating that the values
        being compared (the locations) are the same, and this equality is the primary
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Eastern Michigan

        impossibility" because the College of Health and Human Services is a part
        of Eastern Michigan University, making the comparison invalid. The model is
        rejecting the premise of the comparison rather than stating the locations
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        The reason for the NO is not based on equal values but on the containment
        relationship.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison doesn't make
        geographical sense because one entity (the College) is contained within the
        other (the University). The model states "They are not separate geographical
        entities where one could be west of the other" which is explaining a conceptual
        issue with the comparison rather than stating the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Eastern Michigan
        University is not located west of its College of Health and Human Services..."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the College is part of the
        university itself and located within the university's campus. The reason for
        the NO is not that they are in the same location, but rather that the relationship
        between them is that one is part of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Eastern Michigan

        College being a subset of the University." The primary reason for the NO answer
        is that they are at the same location (with one being a subset of the other),
        making them essentially equal in terms of east-west positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Eastern Michigan

        the university cannot be west of one of its constituent parts. The reasoning
        is about containment/inclusion rather than equality of values.

        further west than Belleville.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations of University of Tennessee College of Dentistry
        and Lindenwood University-Belleville. The model concluded that Memphis (where
        University of Tennessee College of Dentistry is located) is slightly further
        west than Belleville (where Lindenwood University-Belleville is located).

        equal as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference
        in position, stating "Memphis is very slightly east of Belleville" as the
        reason for its NO answer. Even though it mentions they are "at almost the
        same longitude," it still identifies a directional difference (east vs. west)
        rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the University of Tennessee College of Dentistry is located west
        of Lindenwood University-Belleville. However, there's a contradiction in the
        explanation - first saying "Memphis is slightly west of Belleville" but then
        concluding "with Memphis being very slightly east of Belleville." Despite
        this contradiction, the model clearly gives "NO" as its final comparative
        answer.

        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference
        (east vs. west), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that DePaul is NOT west of UIC. This is a clear negative comparative
        result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "DePaul is located
        east of UIC" - indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, DePaul University is
        not located west of University of Illinois at Chicago College of Liberal Arts
        and Sciences." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that UIC is west of DePaul, indicating
        a directional difference between their locations. The model states "In fact,
        UIC is west of DePaul" as the reason for its NO answer, not because they are
        in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - DePaul University is
        NOT located west of University of Illinois at Chicago College of Liberal Arts
        and Sciences." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that DePaul is located
        east of UIC, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is that the premise in the question is incorrect
        (DePaul is east, not west of UIC).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, DePaul University is
        not located west of University of Illinois at Chicago College of Liberal Arts
        and Sciences. It is located east of it." This is an explicit NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that DePaul University
        is east of UIC College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, indicating a directional
        difference between their locations. The model clearly identifies a difference
        in their relative positions, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that "DePaul University is east of UIC College of Liberal
        Arts and Sciences (not west)". This is a clear comparative result where the
        model has decided that the premise of the question (presumably asking if DePaul
        is west of UIC) is false.
