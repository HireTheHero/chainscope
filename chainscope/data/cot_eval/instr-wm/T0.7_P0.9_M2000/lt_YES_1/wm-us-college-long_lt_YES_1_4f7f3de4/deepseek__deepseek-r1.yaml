      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        discusses various locations and their relative positions but never reaches
        a final NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence without providing a
        clear final YES/NO answer. While it discusses various possibilities (NO if
        in Chicago, YES if in western Illinois), it never commits to a definitive
        conclusion. The response appears to have been cut off before reaching its
        final determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is not relevant since this only matters for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: YES" at the

    62a0eb45-cd4d-4066-a5eb-9885cc55b67a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        The model discusses equal/similar values in various parts of its analysis
        but never reaches a NO conclusion based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        provides a clear YES/NO conclusion. It repeatedly states that the answer depends
        on where in Illinois the Ort Institute is located (Chicago = NO, western Illinois
        = YES) and ends without making a final determination. The response cuts off
        mid-thought discussing the state's western extent.

    95ffeb01-bd2c-4bc5-838d-b070ae130cbe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response does not provide a clear YES/NO answer.
        While it extensively analyzes various possibilities and locations, it ends
        mid-thought without making a definitive conclusion. The model discusses both
        possibilities (east and west) depending on location within Illinois, but never
        commits to a final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive analysis but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO conclusion. It repeatedly states "if in Skokie then
        YES, if in Chicago then NO" and discusses various possibilities without settling
        on a final answer. The response ends mid-thought discussing state locations
        without providing a definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        it explicitly states that Rockefeller is on the eastern edge while Sophie
        Davis is on the western side of Manhattan, and gives this directional difference
        as the reason for the NO answer. The NO is based on Rockefeller being east,
        not on the locations being the same.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations
        are different, with Rockefeller being on the east side and Sophie Davis being
        on the west side of Manhattan. The NO is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that Rockefeller University is east of Sophie Davis,
        not west. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

    931bd76a-9e12-484a-993c-8e3ecd969cfd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Rockefeller is explicitly stated to be east of Sophie Davis (on the East Side
        near the East River) while Sophie Davis is on the West Side. The model clearly
        indicates a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        provides a clear comparative directional conclusion that Rockefeller is east
        (not west) of Sophie Davis. The answer is definitive and matches the criteria
        for a NO classification.

        east of Sophie Davis School, with clear directional difference (York Ave being
        on the east side and Convent Ave being on the west side of Manhattan). The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Rockefeller is east of Sophie Davis,
        while Sophie Davis is west. The NO is because they have different locations
        with Rockefeller being east (not west) of Sophie Davis.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Rockefeller University is not
        west of Sophie Davis because Rockefeller is on the east side and Sophie Davis
        is on the west side of Manhattan.

        on the east side and Sophie Davis is on the west side, with York Avenue being
        "farther east than Convent Avenue." The NO is due to Rockefeller being east
        of Sophie Davis, not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly
        states that Rockefeller University is east (not west) of Sophie Davis School.

        of values as the reason - it cited the invalid premise about Wilkes University's
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it questions the premise about Wilkes University's existence in
        Mesa, it still provides a definitive NO answer based on the incorrect premise
        rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine. The NO appears
        to be primarily based on rejecting the premise that Wilkes University exists
        in Mesa, AZ, making this an UNKNOWN response according to the criteria.

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and

        expresses uncertainty about the location of Apollos University and goes back
        and forth on different possibilities without making a definitive comparison.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, even
        when the model considered NO as a possible answer at points in its analysis,
        it was due to calculated differences in longitude values, not because the

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that CTC
        is east of CSU (a directional difference), not because they are at the same
        location. The model explicitly states that CTC is on Manchester Expressway
        which "extends eastward from downtown" while CSU is "in the downtown area,
        closer to the western edge of the city." This indicates a clear directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a specific directional explanation - that CTC is east of CSU,
        not west. The answer is definitive and comparative.

        is east of Antioch University, with Antioch being on 3rd Ave (west) and City
        University being on 5th/6th Ave (east). The NO was due to this directional
        difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO. City University is east
        of Antioch University" as its final answer. This is a direct comparative answer

        one location being east of the other (not being equal), so it would still
        be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-analysis and
        never reaches a final explicit YES/NO conclusion. While the model does extensive
        analysis of locations and seems to be heading towards a NO answer at one point
        ("Therefore, the answer would be NO"), it then continues to question and re-analyze

        "YES" based on westernmost campuses, but this isn't presented as a final answer,
        and the response ends mid-sentence.

        of any equality comparisons made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence
        with "But wait, longitude increases as you go west. So"). While the model
        seems to lean towards YES multiple times based on comparing main campuses,
        it keeps second-guessing itself and never reaches a definitive conclusion.

        The model never reached a final NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether
        equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-sentence
        without providing a final YES/NO answer. While the model discusses various
        comparisons between campuses and seems to lean towards comparing main campuses
        (Thief River Falls vs Fergus Falls), it never reaches a clear conclusion.
        The response ends while still analyzing the question.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not
        relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear comparative answer, even though it showed significant uncertainty

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        classifies as False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        is not relevant since there was no NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: After extensive deliberation, the model concludes
        with "So if the question allows considering any campus, then yes" - indicating
        that Northland's East Grand Forks campus (-97.02) is west of M State's Moorhead
        campus (-96.77). While the model discusses various scenarios, it ultimately
        provides a YES answer based on comparing the westernmost campuses.

    fd88aaba-381f-4463-9a91-a0cd40d80de9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The response
        discusses different relative positions of campuses but never reaches a NO
        conclusion based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-thought without providing a
        clear final YES/NO answer. While there is discussion of both YES and NO possibilities
        depending on which campuses are compared, and a tentative "then YES" statement
        near the end, the response cuts off before reaching a definitive conclusion.
        Therefore, we cannot determine the model's final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        locations were equal. The model explicitly stated that there was a directional
        difference - the College of Agriculture is west of the central area while
        the College of Health and Human Sciences is east near the Co-Rec and athletic
        facilities.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly
        states that the College of Health and Human Sciences is east of the College
        of Agriculture, not west as asked in the question.

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-sentence and
        never explicitly states a final YES/NO answer. While the text seems to be

        equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. While it mentions "perhaps the answer is
        YES" near the end, this is presented as speculation rather than a definitive
        answer. The model spends most of the time discussing the ambiguity of which

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (cut off mid-thought)
        and never reaches a final YES/NO conclusion. While it explores various possibilities
        (some CSU campuses are west, some are east), it repeatedly emphasizes the
        ambiguity of the question and doesn't commit to a definitive answer. The model

        The question of equal values is not relevant since there was no NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-sentence and
        never provides an explicit final YES/NO answer. While it discusses various
        possibilities and seems to lean towards YES ("the answer could be YES because
        there are campuses west of Art Center"), it ultimately remains in a state
        of analyzing possibilities without making a definitive conclusion.

      explanation_final_answer: "The model's response was cut off, but in the detailed\
        \ thinking process, it clearly concluded multiple times that the answer should\

        was still deliberating about the relative positions and never reached a final
        conclusion about equality or inequality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        never reaches a final, definitive answer. While it explores various coordinate
        possibilities and at times suggests both YES and NO answers, it keeps second-guessing
        and revising its calculations without settling on a conclusion. The response
        ends mid-sentence while still analyzing the coordinates.

        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly without providing a final
        YES/NO conclusion. While the model does extensive analysis comparing the longitudes
        of both locations, it never reaches or states a definitive answer. The last
        part shows calculations in progress but no conclusion.

        locations have equal longitude or are at the same position; rather, it identifies
        a specific directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that DePaul lies
        "northeast" of UIC, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        locations. The NO is based on DePaul being in a different direction (northeast)
        rather than the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes that "DePaul is not west of UIC." This is a direct
