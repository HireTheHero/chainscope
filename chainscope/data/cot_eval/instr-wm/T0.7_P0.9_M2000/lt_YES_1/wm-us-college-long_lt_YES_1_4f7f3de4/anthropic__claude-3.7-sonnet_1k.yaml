      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response, indicating that it believes The Ort Institute in IL is west of University
        of Wisconsin-Sheboygan in WI.

    2e277b57-bfae-4fa0-9f3d-7a08de920598:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (longitudes)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that The Ort Institute in Illinois
        is likely not west of University of Wisconsin-Sheboygan because Sheboygan
        is on the eastern edge of Wisconsin, and most of Illinois would be either
        at a similar longitude or to the west. The model is not claiming equality
        as the reason for its NO answer, but rather a directional assessment (that
        The Ort Institute is likely east or at similar longitude, not west).
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"NO (The Ort Institute,\
        \ IL is likely not west of University of Wisconsin\u2013Sheboygan, WI)\" as\
        \ its final answer. This is a clear NO response to the comparative question."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that The Ort Institute
        would be east of or south of Sheboygan, not west of it. The model is indicating
        a difference in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, The Ort Institute
        in Illinois is not located west of University of Wisconsin-Sheboygan." This
        is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that The Ort Institute in Illinois
        would be south or southeast of UW-Sheboygan, not west of it. The NO answer
        is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as its final answer to whether The Ort Institute is west of UW-Sheboygan.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        and not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions:

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confirm
        this with certainty due to the unclear nature of "The Ort Institute, IL")".
        Since the model explicitly states "NO" but immediately qualifies it with uncertainty
        about being able to confirm the comparison, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.
        The model is indicating it cannot make a definitive comparison due to lack
        of information about one of the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional explanation, stating
        that Illinois is "generally positioned south and east of Wisconsin, not west
        of it" and that any location in Illinois would be "to the south or southeast
        of Sheboygan, not to the west." The model is claiming a directional difference
        (south/southeast vs. west) as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether The Ort Institute in Illinois is west of University of Wisconsin-Sheboygan.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Illinois is south of Wisconsin
        (not west), and Sheboygan is on the eastern edge of Wisconsin, so any location
        in Illinois would be southeast of Sheboygan, not west. The model is indicating
        a directional difference (southeast vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that The Ort Institute in IL is not west of University
        of Wisconsin-Sheboygan, WI.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it questions the existence of the Ort Institute
        in Illinois and suggests that if "IL" refers to Israel, the institution would
        be east of Wisconsin (not equal in longitude). The NO answer is based on the
        institution being east (if in Israel) or not verifiable (if supposed to be
        in Illinois), not because the locations have equal longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"NO, The Ort Institute\
        \ is not located west of University of Wisconsin\u2013Sheboygan, WI, based\
        \ on the information available.\" This is a clear NO answer to the comparative\

        southeast of Sheboygan, not west of it. The model is indicating a directional
        difference (east/southeast vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - The Ort Institute

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have
        different east-west positions, with Webber International University being
        to the east of Ohio Valley University. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Webber International University is west of Ohio
        Valley University. The model clearly concludes that Webber International University
        in Florida would be east of Ohio Valley University in West Virginia, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal as the reason for its NO answer. While it mentions they are "at roughly
        the same longitude," it immediately adds "with Ohio Valley University being
        slightly more west." This indicates a difference in values, even if slight,
        which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Webber International
        University in Florida is NOT located west of Ohio Valley University in West
        Virginia." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same or equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the universities
        are in different positions, with Webber International University being east
        or southeast of Ohio Valley University, not west of it. The model gives a
        directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Webber International University is west of Ohio
        Valley University. The model clearly concludes that "the Florida institution
        would be east (or southeast) of the West Virginia institution, not west of
        it" and ends with "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, it contradicts itself - in the main
        response it claims "Babson Park, FL is actually slightly west of Vienna, WV"
        but then in parentheses states "Ohio Valley University is actually slightly
        west of Webber International University". Either way, it's indicating a difference
        in position (not equality) as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clear and direct, with no qualifications
        that would make it an UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    898fddf4-a142-43ca-8e14-276b62ad3f4c:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, it states "The two locations are
        very close in terms of longitude, but Babson Park, FL is slightly west of
        Vienna, WV." This indicates a difference in values (with Babson Park being
        slightly west), which contradicts the premise of the question. The model's
        reasoning appears inconsistent with its NO answer, but I'm evaluating only
        what was stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis. This is a clear negative response to the
        question of whether Webber International University is located west of Ohio
        Valley University.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Florida is positioned
        east of West Virginia, indicating a difference in positions. The model's reasoning
        for the NO answer is that "Florida is positioned east (not west) of West Virginia
        on a US map," which means Webber International University would be east of
        Ohio Valley University - not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Webber International University, FL located west of Ohio
        Valley University, WV?" The model clearly concludes that Webber International
        University is not west of Ohio Valley University, but rather east of it.

        of Professional Psychology is "actually EAST of" Newton College of the Sacred
        Heart, indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        area where the Massachusetts School of Professional Psychology is located
        is slightly west and south of the Centre Street area where Newton College
        of the Sacred Heart was located." The model is noting a difference in location
        (slightly west), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer, which is contradictory
        to its conclusion but must be classified based on what was stated.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as its final answer to whether Massachusetts School of Professional

        The model is noting a difference in their positions, with CLC being east of
        Chamberlain, not west, which is why it answers NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that College of Lake County is not west of Chamberlain
        University. The model provides a clear comparative answer after analyzing
        the geographic locations of both institutions.

        is actually slightly east or approximately on the same longitude as the University
        of New England campuses." The mention of "slightly east" indicates a difference
        in values, even if there's also a possibility they're approximately the same.
        Since the model notes a potential directional difference (slightly east),
        this doesn't qualify as stating the values are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it rejects the comparison entirely by claiming
        that "Apollos University doesn't have a physical campus in California" and
        therefore cannot be compared on an east-west basis with City of Hope. This
        is not a claim of equality but rather a rejection of one of the comparison
        points.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Apollos University doesn't have a proper physical campus in California,
        and its main location is in Montana. The model is not claiming the locations
        are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Apollos University,

        However, the model is rejecting the premise of the question by stating "The
        question contains a faulty premise, as Apollos University is not primarily
        established with a physical campus in California, making the east-west comparison
        impossible to determine as stated." This indicates the model cannot make the

        While it does explain that Apollos University is not physically located in
        California (which could be interpreted as rejecting the premise), the model

        is) is "slightly west of Vallejo" (where California Maritime Academy is),
        indicating a difference in their positions. The model concludes that "Patten
        University is west of California Maritime Academy, not the other way around."
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        between the locations, saying "Oakland (Patten University) is southwest of
        Vallejo" and "Oakland is further west in the Bay Area than Vallejo." This
        indicates the locations have different longitudes.

        Academy." The model's reasoning indicates a difference in position (Oakland
        being west of Vallejo), not equality. The NO answer appears to be inconsistent
        with the reasoning provided, as the reasoning actually supports a YES answer
        to the question "Is California Maritime Academy located west of Patten University?"
        but the model concluded NO.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that California Maritime
        Academy is east of Patten University, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their locations. The reason for the NO answer is that the locations
        have different positions, with one being east of the other, not that they
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether California Maritime Academy is west of Patten University.
        The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining that California

        and Patten University being west of California Maritime Academy. The model
        gives a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.

        these are colleges within the same university rather than separate institutions.
        The model doesn't claim the locations are identical - it actually states "they
        may occupy different buildings on campus" but argues that the comparison is

        "the question contains a false premise - these aren't separate institutions
        with distinct locations, but rather different colleges within the same university
        campus." The model is rejecting the premise of the question rather than stating

        locations on campus, with the College of Agricultural Sciences & Natural Resources
        being in the "northwest and western areas of campus" while the Whitacre College
        of Engineering is in the "central to eastern parts of campus." The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly indicates that the College of Agricultural Sciences & Natural
        Resources is located west of the Whitacre College of Engineering, not the

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, it explicitly states that the Engineering
        facilities are on the western side of campus and the Agricultural Sciences
        facilities are on the eastern side, indicating they are in different locations.
        The model's NO answer contradicts its own reasoning, but it did not claim
        equality as the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it then contradicts itself in parentheses by saying the correct answer
        should be "YES". Since we're evaluating what the model actually stated as
        its answer (not what it claims is correct), the final answer is NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that both colleges
        are on the same campus but in different buildings, and that without a campus
        map, it cannot determine their exact east-west positioning. The NO answer
        is based on the model's inability to verify the east-west relationship, not
        on equality of positions.

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't determine the relationship without more information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer begins with "NO" but immediately
        clarifies that it "cannot confirm" the comparison. This indicates the model
        is stating it cannot determine the answer rather than making a definitive
        comparative judgment. The model explains that without detailed campus map
        information, it can't determine the east-west relationship between the buildings.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is indicating it cannot
        make the comparison.

        are "not meaningfully 'west' or 'east' of each other in a geographic sense"
        because they are on the same campus. This is not claiming equality of position
        but rather rejecting the premise of meaningful geographic comparison. The

        of the Arts is part of Southern Methodist University and is located within
        SMU's campus, which is why it cannot be west of the entire university. The
        reason for the NO answer is based on containment (one being part of the other),

        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Tennessee is east of Wisconsin,
        meaning the locations have different east-west positions. The model's NO answer
        is based on the directional difference (Tennessee being east of Wisconsin,
        not west), not on any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Bethel University, TN is located west of Marian
        University, WI. The model clearly concludes that "Since Tennessee is east

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        Hartford International University (in Connecticut) is EAST of Vermont Studio
        Center (in Vermont), not west. The model identifies a directional difference
        (east vs. west) rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Hartford International University for Religion and
        Peace, CT is not located west of Vermont Studio Center, VT. The model provides

        The model states "they are in the same location" and "neither can be 'west
        of' the other." This indicates the model is saying NO because the locations
        are the same/identical, making them equal in terms of east-west positioning.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison is invalid
        because Franklin College is a part of the University of Georgia, not because
        they are at the same location. The model explains that "Franklin College is
        a constituent part of the University of Georgia, not a separate institution
        with its own distinct location." This is a different reason than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - University of Georgia

        states they "are located in the same place" and compares it to asking if "a
        house is west of one of its rooms." The NO answer is given because the model
        determines they are in the exact same location (one being part of the other),
        making them equal in terms of location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        cannot be west of itself or a part of itself in this context." This is not
        claiming equality of values but rather explaining a logical relationship (part-whole)
        that makes the comparison invalid.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Columbia College Hollywood
        is located further west than University of West Los Angeles. The model specifically
        states that "Columbia College Hollywood is located in Tarzana, in the San
        Fernando Valley region" which is "in the western San Fernando Valley" and
        that "The San Fernando Valley (including Tarzana) is actually west of Inglewood"

        are at "approximately the same longitude" but others differ in location, with
        M State having "some campuses further east." This indicates a difference in
        positions rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.

        Grand Forks (NCTC) are both on Minnesota's western border, but neither is
        significantly west of the other." This indicates the model is saying NO because
        the westernmost campuses of both institutions are at approximately the same
        longitude (on the western border), making them essentially equal in terms
        of how far west they are located. The equality of their western positions

        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "neither college
        is consistently west of the other, as they both have campuses along Minnesota's
        western border with North Dakota." The model notes that both have campuses
        on the North Dakota border, but doesn't claim they're at the exact same longitude
        or that they're equal in position. It even mentions that Moorhead is "slightly
        further south along that border" than East Grand Forks.

        is "actually the westernmost location among all these campuses." The model
        is indicating that M State (specifically its Moorhead campus) is further west
        than Northland, not that they are at the same longitude.

        but different latitudes." This indicates the model is saying NO because the
        campuses are at approximately the same longitude (equal east-west position),
        which is the primary reason for its NO answer.

        saying it cannot determine the answer due to ambiguity in the question (CSU
        being a system rather than a single location), so this falls under the UNKNOWN

        believe Cordoba University exists in Virginia." This is a case where the model
        rejects the premise of the question (claiming one of the universities doesn't
        exist) rather than making a comparative judgment about locations. The model
        is saying it cannot determine the answer because one entity may not exist.

        Health" and "the College of Pharmacy is indeed west of the School of Public
        Health." The model gave a NO answer despite describing a difference in location,
        not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This contradicts its earlier reasoning where it
        stated "the College of Pharmacy is indeed west of the School of Public Health,"
        which would logically lead to a "YES" answer. Despite this contradiction,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the College of Pharmacy is west of the School of Public Health, not east.
        The model explicitly states "the School of Public Health building is located
        east of the central campus area where the College of Pharmacy is situated"
        and "the College of Pharmacy building lies to the west when compared to the
        School of Public Health." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model concludes that the College of Pharmacy is not east of the School of
        Public Health (in fact, it states the opposite - that the College of Pharmacy
        lies to the west when compared to the School of Public Health).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Loyola University Chicago
        is located east of Illinois College of Optometry, indicating a directional
        difference between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Loyola University Chicago
        is not located west of Illinois College of Optometry. It is located east of

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Loyola University Chicago
        is positioned to the northeast of Illinois College of Optometry, indicating
        a directional difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference
        (northeast vs. west), not on equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Loyola University Chicago is not located west of
        Illinois College of Optometry. The model clearly provides a negative answer
        to the comparative question.

        between the two locations. The model specifically states "Loyola University
        Chicago is located EAST of the Illinois College of Optometry, not west of
        it." This shows the model is noting a difference in values (east vs. west),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Loyola University Chicago is not located west of

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Loyola University Chicago
        would be east of Illinois College of Optometry (not west), indicating a directional
        difference between their locations. The model states "Loyola University Chicago
        would be east of Illinois College of Optometry, not west" as the reason for
        its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the Illinois College of Optometry
        is "slightly west of Loyola University Chicago." The model is noting a difference
        in their east-west positions, with ICO being more westerly than Loyola, which
        is why it answers NO to the question of whether Loyola is west of ICO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Loyola University Chicago is not west of Illinois
        College of Optometry. In fact, the model concludes that "the Illinois College
        of Optometry is slightly west of Loyola University Chicago."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal as the primary reason for its NO answer. While it mentions they are
        "at approximately the same longitude," it actually suggests Loyola is "slightly
        east" of the College of Optometry, indicating a directional difference rather
        than equality. The model is noting a difference in position, even if slight,
        rather than claiming they are at exactly the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Loyola University Chicago is west of Illinois College of Optometry.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison doesn't make
        geographical sense because the College of Health and Human Services is a component
        of Eastern Michigan University, not a separate entity that can be directionally

        Michigan University (like Texas being part of the United States). The model
        is rejecting the premise of the comparison rather than stating the locations

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison is flawed
        because the College of Health and Human Services is a part of Eastern Michigan
        University, not a separate entity. The model states "it doesn't make sense
        to describe one as being west or east of the other" and compares it to "asking
        if a house is west of one of its rooms." This is a rejection of the premise
        rather than a statement that the locations are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, making a clear comparative judgment. While the model explains that
        the comparison doesn't make sense because the College is part of the University,
        it still provides a definitive "NO" answer rather than refusing to answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the College of Health and
        Human Services is a subset or component of Eastern Michigan University, located
        within the university campus. The model argues that it's illogical for the
        university to be west of one of its own components, similar to how "the United
        States is west of Texas" would be illogical. This is not an equality argument
        but rather a containment/subset relationship argument.

        meaning they are essentially in the same location. The model states "it cannot
        be geographically separate from the university as a whole" and "the university
