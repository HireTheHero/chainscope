      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't verify one location's
        existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        give a YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot verify one of the locations.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN classification as the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    1fea05ad-24b6-4d18-bd99-05e79f1de923:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" due to being unable to verify one location. The model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains it cannot verify the location of one of the
        institutions. This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the
        comparison due to inability to verify information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    40aabb0f-7fe1-43a9-b144-7197140fc4bb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Additionally, the model never
        claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't verify one location's
        existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (because the premise
        of the institute's existence cannot be established)". Since the model is rejecting
        the premise by stating one location doesn't exist rather than making a comparative
        determination, this should be classified as UNKNOWN per the instructions.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    5f3ef85a-cdc7-4174-8339-2516af45c77d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        compared actual values or stated they were equal - it simply couldn't verify
        the institutions to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and questions the premises by noting it cannot verify the
        institutions. This matches the UNKNOWN criteria where the model rejects the
        premises or indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't verify
        one location's existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and indicates it cannot make the comparison because one
        location cannot be verified. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where the
        model rejects the premises by indicating one location may not exist.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    7c88c161-0b56-4874-bf66-4e3f59b7c918:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final classification is UNKNOWN (not NO),
        this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't compare them
        because one doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot determine the comparison
        because one location doesn't exist, but ends with "NO". Since the model rejects
        the premises by stating one location doesn't exist, this falls under the UNKNOWN
        classification criteria, despite the "NO" at the end.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO to this question" and explains that it cannot determine the
        relationship because one location cannot be verified to exist. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN classification as the model rejects the premises by indicating
        one location doesn't exist and states it cannot make the comparison.

        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Saint Joseph's University
        is east of University of the Sciences, indicating a directional difference.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Saint Joseph's is "east of" University
        of the Sciences, indicating a directional difference as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and "NOT west of" as
        its conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that Heritage
        University is east of Madera Community College, indicating a difference in
        position. The NO answer is based on Heritage being east (not west) of Madera.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the geographical comparison step-by-step.
        This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        Heritage University is east of Madera Community College, indicating a directional
        difference between their locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Heritage University
        is east of Madera Community College, therefore it is not west of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    6e1a092a-8b45-496a-9472-e245365514cc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Madera is east of Toppenish"
        and concludes NO based on this directional difference, not based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" and provides this as a direct comparative answer based on geographical
        analysis, not due to inability to determine or rejection of premises.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states Heritage University
        is "north and east of Madera, CA" indicating a difference in location. The
        NO is based on Heritage being east (opposite of west) rather than any equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, providing a definitive comparative answer based
        on geographical analysis showing Heritage University is "north and east" rather
        than west of Madera Community College.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that Heritage University is northwest of Madera Community
        College and says NO because it's "NOT directly west." This indicates a difference
        in position (being northwest rather than west) as the reason for the NO answer,
        not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to insufficient information about one location. This
        indicates it cannot make the comparison rather than refusing to answer or
        giving a clear YES/NO.

        make a NO comparison based on equal values - it refused to make any comparison
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not feel comfortable
        providing a YES or NO answer" and explains that it cannot determine the relative
        positions due to incomplete information about one location. This is a clear
        refusal to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a NO comparison based on equal values - it simply stated it couldn't make
        the comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and "does not have enough information to answer this question"
        because it cannot determine the location of one of the universities. This
        is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Additionally, the model never
        claimed the values were equal - it stated one university doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because one of the universities doesn't exist, making the comparison
        impossible. When a model rejects the premises of the question by noting one

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any discussion of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premises of the question since
        one of the universities is fictional, and explicitly states it "cannot provide
        a meaningful YES or NO answer." This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where
        the model rejects the premises of the question.

      result: UNKNOWN
    c6bf2ee2-8624-4e7f-82fd-c1bfaf0bb05e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model didn't
        make a NO comparison based on equal values - it instead indicated it couldn't
        make the comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and concludes with "CANNOT BE DETERMINED". It rejects the
        premise by noting that one of the universities doesn't exist, making comparison
        impossible.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not have enough
        information to give a YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot determine
        the relative locations. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating one location is "east of" the other), not because the locations have
        equal coordinates. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Rockefeller
        University is "actually east of" the other location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Rockefeller University is EAST of Sophie
        Davis, indicating a difference in position. The NO is because the direction
        is opposite to what was asked (west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason for
        NO, stating "the Rockefeller University is actually east of Sophie Davis School,
        not west." This indicates a difference in position, not equality.

        (not NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question,
        per the instructions "If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "CANNOT DETERMINE" and
        explains it "cannot accurately compare" and "cannot confidently answer YES
        or NO" because one of the premises is incorrect (Wilkes University's location).
        This falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria where the model rejects

        claimed the values were equal - it stated they couldn't be compared due to
        incorrect premises.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" and states "NO"
        twice, but it rejects the premise of the question since one university is

        of the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and rejects the premise of the question due to a factual error
        about Wilkes University's location. This is a clear case where the model indicates

        did not cite equality as a reason for its response - it cited inability to
        compare due to incorrect premises.
      explanation_final_answer: The model first states it "cannot confidently answer
        YES or NO" but then provides "NO" when forced to answer. Since it indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to one location being incorrect, and rejects
        the premise of the question, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        a clear directional difference. The NO is because the actual direction (east)
        is opposite to what was asked (west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        make the determination. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "both colleges are in Newton,
        they are essentially in the same location" and uses this equality of location
        as the primary reason for its NO answer ("If they are in the same location,
        neither can be 'west' of the other"). The NO is directly based on their locations
        being the same.

        final conclusion, making this an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer not because the locations
        are equal/same/identical, but because it "cannot prove the west/east positioning."
        It never states the locations are at the same point or equal coordinates -
        it only mentions they are in the same town but cannot determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and while it expresses uncertainty in reaching this conclusion, it
        deliberately chooses NO as its definitive answer rather than refusing to answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "both colleges are in Newton,
        they are essentially in the same location" and concludes "therefore, one cannot
        be west of the other." This explicitly indicates that the locations are the
        same/equal, and this equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, making this an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.'

        location" and "occupy essentially the same geographic area" as the reason
        for its NO answer. This indicates equality of location is the primary reason
        for the NO response.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and when forced gives a NO answer specifically because it
        cannot confirm the positioning, not as a comparative result. This indicates
        inability to make the comparison, which meets the UNKNOWN criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with Boston being east of Newton and Newton being west of Boston. This difference
        in location, not equality, is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, and this NO is a direct comparative result
        based on its geographical analysis.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of whether the locations might be the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to lack of precise location data. This indicates an

        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it just stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model first states it "cannot confidently answer
        YES or NO" but then when forced to give a definitive answer, says "NO" with
        a note that this is a "cautious No" because it cannot confirm positioning.
        Since the model explicitly states it cannot determine/verify the positioning,
        this falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was based on the
        reasoning that Meadows School is located within SMU's campus, making it impossible
        to be west of SMU. This is a different logical relationship than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:
        NO" as its final conclusion, based on its reasoning that Meadows School cannot
        be west of SMU since it is part of SMU''s campus.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that Meadows
        School is located "on the same campus as SMU" and therefore "cannot be west
        of SMU". This is a logical impossibility argument rather than an equality
        comparison. While being on the same campus implies proximity, the model doesn't
        explicitly state they are at the exact same location as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the conclusion of its reasoning and once as a standalone answer.

        west of SMU" because "it is actually part of the same location." This indicates
        the NO answer is based on them being in the exact same location/being the
        same thing, not being different.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Rather, it explains that Meadows School
        is WITHIN the SMU campus, which is a different spatial relationship than equality.
        The NO is based on the impossibility of being west of something you're part
        of, not because of equal locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative response based on its reasoning that Meadows
        School cannot be west of SMU because it is part of SMU's campus.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that Bethel University is east of Marian University,
        indicating a difference in location. The NO is because one location is east
        of the other, not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is east of the other (indicating a difference in position), not because
        the locations have equal coordinates. The model explicitly states "Connecticut
        is east of Vermont" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        as its final answer, providing a comparative directional result based on geographical
        positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Hartford being "further
        east than Johnson, VT", not because the locations are at the same position.
        It explicitly states a difference in position (one is further east than the
        other), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Hartford International University
        is NOT west of Vermont Studio Center"'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it explicitly states that West Hartford
        is "east of Johnson, VT". The NO is based on the direction being opposite
        to what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographic analysis determining
        that Hartford International University is not west of Vermont Studio Center.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - it explicitly states that West Hartford is "south and slightly
        east of Johnson, VT" indicating a difference in position. The NO is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, and this NO is given as a direct comparative answer
        based on geographical analysis showing that one location is not west of the
        other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Connecticut is east of Vermont, not because the locations are at the same
        longitude. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Connecticut
        is east of Vermont"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, and this NO is given as a direct comparative answer
        to whether one location is west of the other.

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is YES" as its final conclusion, reinforcing its step-by-step analysis that
        led to "YES."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it determines that Hartford International University
        is "east of Vermont Studio Center" and bases its NO answer on this directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the geographic positions.

    b77e7aa9-5e53-4e95-ba7a-ee8b2f4ea47b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating one location is east of the other), not because the locations are
        at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        with one being southeast of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Hartford International
        University is east (not west) of Vermont Studio Center.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Lincoln College is east of Lincoln Christian
        University, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Lincoln College is west of Lincoln Christian University, explaining
        that Lincoln College is east of Lincoln Christian University.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" twice -
        once in the final statement of step 6 and again as a standalone answer at
        the end. The model made a clear comparative directional claim that Lincoln
        College is "slightly west of" Lincoln Christian University.

        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, my
        answer is: NO" but indicates it "cannot confidently say" about the relative

        the same town, it explicitly states that Lincoln College is east of Lincoln
        Christian University. The NO answer is based on a directional difference (east
        vs west), not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Lincoln College is west of Lincoln Christian University.
        In fact, it states that Lincoln College is east of Lincoln Christian University.

        they were in the same town but couldn't determine relative positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" and then gives a NO answer qualified with "because I cannot
        confirm the west/east positioning with certainty". This indicates inability
        to determine the comparison, making it an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a NO comparison based on equal values - it simply stated it couldn't make
        the determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it needs more precise information to make
        the determination. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't locate one of the
        institutions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" due to being unable to verify one location. This is a case where
        the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer due to insufficient verified information" and indicates it cannot
        verify one of the locations. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the
        model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to inability to verify one
        of the locations.

    f4eb3d7a-3a3c-4c4d-bf11-c4ba4ab98cef:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that South University is in eastern
        Savannah while Ralston College is in western Savannah, indicating different
        positions. The NO answer is based on relative positions (east vs west) rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Georgian Court
        is southeast of William Paterson, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, and this NO is given as a direct comparative answer
        based on geographical analysis showing Georgian Court is southeast (not west)
        of William Paterson.

        the locations were equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that Georgian
        Court is east of William Paterson, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, making a direct comparative judgment about the geographical
        positions of the two universities. The answer is definitive and based on directional
        comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Georgian Court is east of William Paterson), not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly notes a difference in position,
        with one being east and the other west.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Georgian Court was determined to be east of William Paterson, showing a clear
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that Georgian Court is east of William Paterson, not because the locations
        are equal. It explicitly states "Georgian Court is east of William Paterson"
        and concludes that therefore it cannot be west. The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the geographical positions of the two universities.
        This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Wentworth is east of MIT, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on the geographic
        analysis showing Wentworth is east of MIT.

        of the other, indicating a difference in position. The NO is because the relationship
        is opposite to what was asked (east instead of west).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating one location is east of the other), not because the locations are
        equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        with one being "northeast" of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that John Paul
        the Great Catholic University is "east" of Alliant International University,
        indicating a directional difference. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis
        that one location is east of the other, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that one location
        is EAST of the other, indicating a directional difference. The NO was based
        on the direction being opposite to what was asked, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a specific directional reason (that JPGU

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - rather, it explicitly states that one location is NORTH
        of the other, and this different direction is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on directional
        analysis.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        that Angelo State University is east of Junction (not west), not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states "San Angelo (Angelo State
        University) is east of Junction" indicating a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" and concludes with "NO" as its final answer. This is a direct comparative
        result, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Angelo State University is east of Junction, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative location question, providing a direct response
        based on its geographic analysis that Angelo State University is east of Junction.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because CSU is west of Art Center
        (indicating a directional difference), not because the locations are equal.
        Any directional difference, even if described as slight, means the values
        are not equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations
        are different, with New College being in the central part and Grand Canyon
        University being in the western part of Phoenix, making New College east of
        (not west of) Grand Canyon University.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its step-by-step analysis concluding
        that New College is east of (not west of) Grand Canyon University.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "New College appears to be east
        of Grand Canyon University" - indicating a difference in position, with one
        being east of the other. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that New College is NOT located west of Grand Canyon
        University. The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Virginia Beach is east of
        Dallas, PA, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model did not make a comparison
        of equal values - it instead indicated it couldn't make the comparison at
        all due to the universities not existing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot verify...)" and explicitly
        indicates it cannot determine the comparison because the universities don't
        appear to exist. This is a case where the model rejects the premises of the
        question, making this an UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        NO), this automatically results in False. The model didn't compare actual
        values since it determined the universities don't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because the universities don't exist, rejecting the premise of the
        question. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where "the model rejects the
        premises of the question."

        "Southeastern Louisiana University is located west of Missouri Baptist University".
        The NO answer appears to contradict its own analysis, but we must evaluate
        only what was explicitly stated about equality, not logical consistency.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        Rogers State is east of Sam Houston State, indicating a difference in location.
        The NO was given because the relationship was in the opposite direction of
        what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical analysis. The
        model determined that Rogers State is actually east of Sam Houston State,
        not west.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that South Georgia
        Technical College is "east and south" compared to Southeastern Christian College,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on one location
        being east of the other, not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that "South Georgia Technical College
        is NOT west of Southeastern Christian College"
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        compared actual values or stated they were equal - it simply lacked sufficient
        information to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and "I do not have enough information to determine this
        with certainty." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to
        insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot conclusively
        answer YES or NO" and "does not have enough information to answer this question
        with certainty." This is a clear indication that the model cannot make the
        comparison.

    2fa756e4-863e-4f83-8e96-ab9422ca83ff:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Ball
        State is east of The Way College, not because the locations are equal. It
        explicitly states a directional difference ("Muncie (Ball State) is east of
        Indianapolis"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparative analysis showing
        Ball State is east of The Way College (not west).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5f72d125-291a-4784-abb2-1d1ed17ebdee:

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states that Ball State is
        east of the other campus, indicating a directional difference. The NO is based
        on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" after determining that Ball State is east of the other campus, not west.
        This is a direct comparative NO answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states they are in different
        locations with Ball State being east of the other campus. The NO is based
        on the directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparative analysis that Ball
        State is east (not west) of the other location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and concludes that it does not have enough information to
        answer. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the
        comparison due to insufficient data.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of whether any equality was mentioned (which it wasn't).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer" and "cannot answer this question with certainty" because
        it lacks information about one location. This indicates inability to make
        the comparison rather than refusal or a definitive answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    aeecec20-412f-44d0-ae76-33a071699c2e:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        discussion of equal values (which wasn't present in this response anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and explains that it lacks sufficient information
        to make the comparison. This is a clear refusal to make the comparison rather
        than stating it cannot verify (UNKNOWN) or giving a YES/NO answer.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    d46092be-44f4-4c8b-8ce5-c1e914b7d1bd:

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        discussion of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" due to insufficient location information. This
        indicates it cannot make the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

    daf894e0-83bc-46b1-b968-c8ac41872476:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but immediately qualifies it by saying it cannot be certain of the geographical
        relationship due to insufficient information. Since the model indicates it
        cannot determine the comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Pharmacy building is east of Public Health building), not because
        the locations are the same. Any directional difference, even if small, means
        the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations of the two buildings, providing a direct comparative
        result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "the College of
        Pharmacy is east of the School of Public Health" - indicating a difference
        in position, not equality. The NO is based on the College of Pharmacy being
        in the opposite direction (east) from what was asked (west).

        the locations were equal/same/identical. The NO was because the model found
        the College of Pharmacy is east of the School of Public Health, indicating
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        is described as "slight", any stated difference means this is not a case of
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        is east of UIC (a directional difference), not because the locations are the
        same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("DePaul
        is east of UIC") as the reason for its NO answer.
