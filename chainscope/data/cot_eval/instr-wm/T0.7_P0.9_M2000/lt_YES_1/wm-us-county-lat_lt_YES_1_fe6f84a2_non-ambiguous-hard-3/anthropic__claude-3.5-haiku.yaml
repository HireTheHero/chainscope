        (not equal), with Montana being north of New Mexico. The NO answer appears
        to be an error in the model's reasoning, as its explanation actually supports
        a YES answer to whether Otero County is south of Treasure County.

        Collingsworth County" and concludes that "Cavalier County is north of Collingsworth
        County." The NO answer is given because the model believes the premise is

        County, MI is north of Hernando County, FL" (which logically means Hernando
        County is south of Lenawee County). This contradiction makes the final answer
        unclear and inconsistent with the reasoning provided.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, after concluding that "Conecuh County is definitively
        south of Gogebic County."

    a22c8642-bd9f-4ae9-80be-0aed7520dda4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the two counties are
        equal or the same in location. In fact, it explicitly noted differences in
        their locations, stating "Gogebic County is much further north than Conecuh
        County" and "Gogebic County is in the northwest and Conecuh County is in the
        southeast." The NO answer appears to be due to confusion in the model's reasoning,
        not because the values being compared are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model''s final answer is confusing and contradictory.
        In step 5, it says "Is Conecuh County, AL located south of Gogebic County,
        MI? - No, it is not" but this contradicts its earlier reasoning where it stated
        "Gogebic County is NORTH of Conecuh County" (which would mean Conecuh is south
        of Gogebic). The final explicit answer given is "Answer: NO" which appears
        to be the model''s definitive response.'

        It provides a step-by-step analysis comparing the locations of Conecuh County,
