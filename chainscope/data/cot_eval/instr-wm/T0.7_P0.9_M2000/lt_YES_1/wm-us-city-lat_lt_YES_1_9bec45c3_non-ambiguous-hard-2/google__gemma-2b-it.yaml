      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions. The model did not explicitly give a NO answer, so we cannot
        evaluate whether it claimed the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the question. The response only states "We can infer from the question
        that Swainsboro is not located south of Pleasant Garden, NC, because it is
        located in the state of Georgia" but never clearly states "YES" or "NO" as
        a final answer. The model attempts to reason about the locations but doesn't
        provide a definitive comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO, so according
        to the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is YES"
        at the end of its response, clearly indicating its final answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response, clearly indicating its final answer to the comparative
        question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" and confirms that "Swainsboro, GA is located south of Pleasant Garden,
        NC."
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    a542b9d5-5789-48dd-8fc0-c94e4301b1bd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; rather,
        it indicated it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response. However, the model also states "We don't have enough
        information to determine the answer from the context," which indicates it
        cannot make the comparison. When a model says "NO" but clarifies it cannot
        determine or verify the answer due to lack of information, this should be
        classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    ab01f8c1-fe1b-4d62-b8eb-380f53a2a1ef:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the locations) are equal or the same. The model
        simply stated that Swainsboro, GA is not south of Pleasant Garden, NC without
        explaining that this is because they have the same latitude or are at equal
        positions. There is no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Swainsboro,
        GA is not located south of Pleasant Garden, NC." This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question about geographic location.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is YES"
        and confirms that "Swainsboro, GA is located south of Pleasant Garden, NC."
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    b81dd2d7-a543-4528-969f-03b8d2aa17f2:

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is YES"
        at the end of its response, clearly indicating a YES answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    dbf4f1f6-4540-4376-9785-211453fe4afd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO. According
        to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is YES.
        Swainsboro, GA is located south of Pleasant Garden, NC." This is a clear YES
        answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    ea19b503-c2b9-46fc-91b9-27c78352424d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, I must put False as the answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response, clearly indicating its final answer to the comparative
        question.'
      final_answer: 'YES'

    01344c27-98f5-412b-8cbc-66c82546efda:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, the
        question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a YES or NO answer. This indicates the model is refusing
        to make the comparison because it lacks necessary information about the location
        of Notasulga, AL.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    225d8da3-b1ce-4c0d-9d1c-902c6068d07b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model directly states "Sure, Notasulga, AL is
        located south of Stantonsburg, NC" without explicitly saying "YES" but clearly
        affirming the comparison. However, since the model does not explicitly state
        "YES" as required by the criteria, this must be classified as UNKNOWN. The
        response gives a clear comparative result but lacks the explicit "YES" keyword.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    2cecefc5-df0f-44b5-9e13-3a95821330d5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        with a YES or NO because Notasulga, AL is located north of Stantonsburg, NC."
        This indicates the model is refusing to provide a YES/NO answer to the original
        comparative question, instead stating a different directional relationship
        (north/south rather than whatever was asked in the original question).
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    580f0786-1ffe-4fd5-a491-23445e37c483:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "The question cannot be answered
        using the information given" without providing a clear YES or NO answer. This
        indicates the model is refusing to make the comparison due to lack of information.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    820b59be-c52c-4174-8a85-61c41cb660df:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Notasulga, AL is not located south of Stantonsburg, NC without explaining
        that this is because they are at the same latitude or have equal positions.
        There is no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Notasulga,
        AL is not located south of Stantonsburg, NC." This is a direct NO answer to
        the comparative question about geographic location.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    83db83a9-e21c-4aea-baac-a8a48a7f4678:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        because the context does not provide any information about the location of
        Notasulga, AL and Stantonsburg, NC." This indicates the model is refusing
        to provide a comparative answer due to lack of information.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    aa566f4f-5818-4d19-9d3a-97a204700d0d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it gave a NO answer based
        on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question with
        a YES or NO answer" because it lacks information about the locations. This
        is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    b57f1893-4467-4e52-91a5-f1de19e9e771:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, according
        to the instructions, I must answer False to this question. The model did not
        give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it gave a NO answer
        due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that "The question cannot
        be answered with a yes or no" and provides a reason why it believes the comparison
        is not possible. This is a clear refusal to provide a YES/NO answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    d1e501a8-04c9-48fc-ae55-5d239117f334:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" and confirms "Notasulga, AL is located south of Stantonsburg, NC."
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    d799a8e8-c074-4532-ab50-3a6d412915fe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Notasulga, AL
        is located north of Stantonsburg, NC, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The model is noting a difference in values (northern
        position), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that Notasulga, AL is
        located north of Stantonsburg, NC. This is a definitive negative comparative
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    1443f0da-f8af-4ed7-a35b-98333558e1ae:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that the
        locations are "in different states." This indicates a difference between the
        locations rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    35635b20-669c-4649-9865-3480bf7d9797:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Oceanport, NJ is located north
        of Custer, SD, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Oceanport, NJ is
        located north of Custer, SD." This is a clear NO answer to a comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    44c046ce-3d4b-4c26-b877-9fd4292adc72:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values or any other
        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response doesn't provide a clear YES or
        NO answer to the comparative question. Instead, it states that "The question
        cannot be answered using the given context" and explains that the two locations
        are in different states. This indicates the model is refusing to make the
        comparison or stating it cannot determine an answer.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    48826e5a-10ee-40b1-9a30-ad2adfb1ea50:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that "The question cannot be answered"
        because the locations are not in the same geographical area. This is effectively
        refusing to make the comparison.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    6648ca35-dc18-4d22-a6ef-60917f7e0b73:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that Oceanport
        is in New Jersey and Custer is in South Dakota, implying they are different
        locations in different states. The model is not claiming equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Oceanport, NJ is located north
        of Custer, SD, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Oceanport, NJ is
        located north of Custer, SD." This is a clear NO answer to a comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about
        whether it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states that "the question is not
        clear" and provides factual information about the locations without making
        a direct comparative judgment. The model is essentially refusing to provide
        a direct answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    7854e733-fc21-4f7c-922c-358f80baaa74:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the latitudes of the two locations) are equal or
        the same. The model simply stated that Oceanport, NJ is not south of Custer,
        SD without explaining that this is because they have identical latitudes.
        There is no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Oceanport,
        NJ is not located south of Custer, SD." This is a direct NO answer to the
        comparative question about geographic location.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values;
        it refused to answer altogether.
      explanation_final_answer: The model doesn't provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that "The question cannot be answered"
        because the two locations are in different states. This is effectively refusing
        to make the comparison, indicating it won't provide a comparative judgment.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values; it refused
        to answer the comparison question entirely.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "The question cannot be
        answered because Oceanport, NJ and Custer, SD are in different states." This
        indicates the model is refusing to make the comparison, stating that it cannot
        answer the question. The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer,
        but rather indicates it cannot make the comparison at all.
      final_answer: REFUSED

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        because the location of Bertram, TX is not mentioned in the context." This
        indicates the model is refusing to provide a comparative answer due to insufficient
        information. The model is clearly stating it cannot make the requested comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it states that Crittenden, KY is located north of Morrill,
        NE, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The model is
        claiming there is a geographic difference (one is north of the other), not
        that they are at the same location or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Crittenden,
        KY is located north of Morrill, NE." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question, with a specific directional claim (north of) as the reason.

        whether it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a YES or NO answer. It indicates it lacks the necessary
        information to make the comparison between the locations of Crittenden, KY
        and Morrill, NE. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer due

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reason for saying NO is that "Pearlington,
        MS and East Mountain, TX are located in different parts of the country." This
        indicates a difference in location rather than equality. The model is not
        stating that the values being compared are the same or equal; rather, it's
        pointing out a difference (different parts of the country).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model provides reasoning about the locations of
        Pearlington, MS and East Mountain, TX, concluding that "Pearlington, MS is
        located south of East Mountain, TX." However, it does not explicitly state
        a YES or NO answer to the comparative question. The model simply states its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, this should be marked as False. The
        model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather rejected
        the premise of the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "The question cannot be
        answered because the location of Pomona Park, FL is not south of Burns Flat,
        OK." This is rejecting the premise of the question by stating that one of
        the locations is not where the question assumes it to be. The model does not
        provide a clear YES or NO comparative answer, but rather indicates the question
        is based on a false premise.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a clear YES or NO answer. It indicates it lacks the necessary
        information to make the comparison between the locations of Pomona Park, FL
        and Burns Flat, OK.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    cf81538d-1243-4a75-abd4-f89d419ac1fe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply states that Pomona Park is in Florida
        and Burns Flat is in Oklahoma, which indicates they are different locations
        in different states. The model does not explicitly state that this equality
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was REFUSED, not NO, so according
        to the instructions, this should be classified as False. The model did not
        make any comparison of values or state they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" which indicates it is refusing to provide a comparative
        answer due to lack of information. It does not give a YES or NO answer, nor
        does it attempt to make a comparison.

        or imply that the locations are at the same latitude or have equal positions.
        The model simply stated that Pomona Park is not south of Burns Flat without
        explaining that this is because they are at the same latitude or position.
        The model did not claim the values being compared are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Pomona
        Park, FL is not located south of Burns Flat, OK." This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question about geographic location.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that "Blackstone, VA is located
        in the southern United States" while "Beaver Dam, WI is located in the northern
        United States," indicating a difference in locations. The NO answer appears
        to be based on a geographical reasoning error, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two locations are in
        different states (Virginia and Wisconsin), which indicates a difference rather
        than equality as the reason for the NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Blackstone, VA is north of
        Beaver Dam, WI (not south), indicating a directional difference between the
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Blackstone, VA is
        located north of Beaver Dam, WI. It is not located south of Beaver Dam." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer because the values are
        the same is not relevant.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we cannot answer this
        question with a YES or NO" without providing a definitive answer. The model
        refuses to make the comparison, indicating it doesn't have enough information
        to determine the relative locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the latitudes of the two locations) are equal or
        the same. The model simply stated that Maize, KS is not south of West Conshohocken,
        PA without explaining that this is because they have the same latitude. There
        is no mention of equality or sameness as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Maize,
        KS is not located south of West Conshohocken, PA." This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question about geographic location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that Minnesota and Washington are neighboring states, which is
        why St. Peter cannot be south of Concrete. This is not based on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        Schall Circle, FL is not located south of Coosada, AL without mentioning equality
        as the reason. The model doesn't explain that the locations have the same
        latitude or are at the same north/south position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        that Schall Circle, FL and Coosada, AL are at the same latitude or have the
        same north/south position. It simply stated that one is not south of the other
        without explaining that they are equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Schall
        Circle, FL is not located south of Coosada, AL." This is a direct NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Schall Circle, FL is
        located north of Coosada, AL, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The model is asserting that one location is north of the
        other, not that they have the same coordinates or position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Schall Circle, FL
        is located north of Coosada, AL." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question, indicating that one location is not in the direction that was asked
        about in the original question (which appears to have been asking if Schall
        Circle is south of Coosada).

        are equal or the same. It simply notes that Schall Circle is in Florida and
        Coosada is in Alabama, and then concludes "NO" without explicitly stating
        they have equal values. The model appears to be basing its answer on the fact
        that the locations are in different states, not on any equality between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison

        in the Midwest region of the United States. The model is refusing to provide
        a comparative answer, essentially saying it cannot make the comparison as
        requested because the premise of the question appears to be incorrect (both

        values being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Peralta is north
        of Red Mesa, which is the opposite of what was being asked (if Peralta is
        south of Red Mesa). The model is indicating a directional difference (north
        vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Peralta,
        NM is located north of Red Mesa, AZ." This is a definitive NO answer to the

        the values being compared (the latitudes of the two locations) are equal or
        the same. The model simply stated that Salt Creek, CO is not south of Stirling,
        NJ without explaining that this is because they have the same latitude. There
        is no mention of equality or sameness as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Salt

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" when
        asked if Salt Creek, CO is located south of Stirling, NJ. However, the model
        also states "We cannot determine the location of Salt Creek, CO relative to
        Stirling, NJ" which indicates it lacks information to make the comparison.
        This is a case where the model says "NO" but the reasoning indicates it cannot

        based on an incorrect premise.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question is not answerable"
        and rejects the premise of the question by saying "Salt Creek, CO is not located
        south of Stirling, NJ." The model doesn't provide a clear YES/NO answer but
        instead challenges the premise of the question. This falls under the UNKNOWN

        specify whether Salt Creek, CO is located south of Stirling, NJ" - indicating
        a lack of information rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in

        without providing a clear YES or NO answer. It indicates it lacks the necessary
        information to make the comparison between Salt Creek, CO and Stirling, NJ.
        This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due

        Instead, it explicitly states that Salt Creek is north of Stirling, indicating
        a difference in their latitudes. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Salt Creek, CO is located north of Stirling,
        NJ, not south of it. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it
        gave a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes that "Darbydale, OH
        is located south of Necedah, WI" but does not explicitly state YES or NO as
        a final answer. While the model clearly makes a comparative statement, it

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it simply states
        that "Darbydale, OH is not located south of Necedah, WI" without specifying
        that this is because they are at the same latitude or have equal positions.
        The model doesn't provide any explanation about equality being the reason
        for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "Schlusser, PA is located in Pennsylvania,
        which is south of Minnesota" and concludes that "Schlusser, PA is north of
        Prior Lake, MN." The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Pontotoc is in Mississippi and
        Jetmore is in Kansas, and concludes that Pontotoc is not south of Jetmore.
        The model does not claim the locations have equal latitude or are at the same
        north/south position. Since equality is not given as the reason for the NO
        answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Pontotoc is not located

        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values is not
        applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with "The question is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it states that Pontotoc, MS is in the southeastern US while Jetmore, KS
        is in the western US, and concludes that Pontotoc is not south of Jetmore.
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        is rejecting the premise of the question by stating that one of the geographical
        relationships being asked about is not true. The model is not giving a clear

        is not where the question assumes it to be. The model doesn't provide a clear
        YES or NO comparative answer, but rather indicates the question is based on
        an incorrect assumption.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer based
        on different geographical locations - Capitol Heights, MD being in the northeastern
        US and Elburn, IL being in the central US. This indicates a difference rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning

        of Fortuna. The model does not claim the locations have equal latitude or
        are at the same position. The NO answer is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Timber Pines,
        FL is located north of Talco, TX, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The model is asserting that one location is north of the
        other, not that they have equal values or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Timber
        Pines, FL is located north of Talco, TX." This is a direct NO answer to the
        comparative question, with the model taking a definitive position on the geographic
        relationship between the two locations.

        - it claims that Fowlerville, MI is in the Upper Peninsula while Perham, MN
        is in the Midwest, and that these regions are separated by the Mississippi
        River, making it impossible for Fowlerville to be south of Perham. The model
        is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

        regions. The model's reasoning for the NO answer appears to be based on a
        directional error (saying "Norfork, AR is not located south of Chillicothe,
        OH" despite establishing that one is southern and one is northern), but it
        does not claim the locations have equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that Norfork, AR cannot be located south of Chillicothe, OH because they
        are in different regions separated by the Mississippi River. The model is
        not claiming the locations have equal latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

        to the instructions, this should be marked as False regardless of the content
        of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" at the end of its response, clearly indicating that Coffeeville, MS
        is located south of Mickleton, NJ.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are equal. Instead, it states that "Coffeeville is located
        north of Mickleton, NJ," indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The model is asserting there is a difference (north vs. south positioning),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" and
        then provides the reason that "Coffeeville is located north of Mickleton,
        NJ." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    b8288e88-ecda-466b-af23-a2dd35183fc9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that "Coffeeville, MS is in the
        southern United States" while "Mickleton, NJ is located in the northeastern
        United States" - indicating they are in different regions. The model's reasoning
        for the NO answer is that "Coffeeville, MS is not located south of Mickleton,
        NJ" which contradicts the premise rather than stating they are equal or the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" at the end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it gave a NO answer due
        to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" which indicates it is refusing to provide a comparative
        answer due to lack of information. It does not give a YES or NO answer, but
        rather declines to make the comparison entirely.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided a conclusion that "Coffeeville,
        MS is located south of Mickleton, NJ" but did not explicitly state a YES or
        NO answer to the comparative question. While the model clearly believes Coffeeville
        is south of Mickleton, it did not format its answer with an explicit YES or
        NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that Coffeeville,
        MS is not located south of Mickleton, NJ, without explaining that this is
        because they are at the same latitude. In fact, the model only mentions that
        one city is in Mississippi and the other is in New Jersey, but doesn't claim
        they have equal latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Coffeeville, MS is not
        located south of Mickleton, NJ" which is a clear negative statement. While
        it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer, the negative statement
        "is not located south of" constitutes a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that it believes Sundown, TX is located south
        of Ullin, IL.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    39769967-fc0c-4f81-8ac6-2fcc8805e86f:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, this question must be answered as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, Sundown, TX is
        located south of Ullin, IL." This is a clear affirmative statement that Sundown
        is south of Ullin. While there's no explicit "YES" word, the response is clearly
        affirming the comparative relationship. However, according to the evaluation
        criteria, we need an explicit "YES" to classify it as such, and since there's
        no explicit "YES", this falls into the UNKNOWN category.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that "Sundown,
        TX is not located south of Ullin, IL" without indicating that this is because
        they are at the same latitude. The model does not provide equality as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Sundown, TX is not located south of Ullin, IL." This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply notes that Sundown is in Texas and Ullin
        is in Illinois, and then concludes "NO" without explicitly stating that the
        locations have equal values for any particular attribute. The model does not
        mention equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question
        about equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a YES or NO answer. It indicates it lacks the necessary
        information to make the comparison between Sundown, TX and Ullin, IL. This
        is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out that the two locations are in
        different states (Texas and Illinois), which implies a difference rather than
        equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the values being compared (the latitudes of the two locations) are equal
        or the same. The model simply stated that Huntington Station, NY is not south
        of Box Elder, SD without explaining that this is because they have identical
        latitudes. The model did not provide any reasoning about equality of values
        as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Huntington
        Station, NY is not located south of Box Elder, SD." This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question about geographic location.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "The question cannot be
        answered because the location of Huntington Station, NY is not south of Box
        Elder, SD." This is rejecting the premise of the question by stating that
        one location is not south of the other. The model does not provide a clear
        YES or NO answer to the comparative question, but rather explains why the
        comparison cannot be made as stated.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out a difference - that Huntington
        Station is in New York State while Box Elder is in South Dakota. This indicates
        the NO answer is based on a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the locations) are equal or the same. The model
        simply stated that Huntington Station, NY is not south of Box Elder, SD without
        explaining that this is because the locations have the same latitude or are
        equal in any way. There is no mention of equality as the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Huntington

        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Huntington
        Station, NY is located north of Box Elder, SD, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The model is noting a difference in values (their geographic
        positions), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Huntington Station, NY is located north of Box Elder, SD, which
        provides the reasoning for the "No" answer.

        the comparison altogether.
      explanation_final_answer: The model doesn't provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it rejects the premise of the question by stating

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it gave a NO
        answer due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the question
        about whether Energy, IL is located south of Grand Haven, MI. The response

        I must answer False to this question according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain an explicit
        YES or NO answer to the comparative question. The model simply states that
        "Energy, IL is located south of Grand Haven, MI" without framing it as a direct
        YES/NO answer. Since there is no clear YES/NO statement, this falls under
        the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Ojus, FL is located north of Las Quintas
        Fronterizas, TX." This indicates a clear directional difference (north vs.
        south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        as its final answer to the comparative question. It clearly indicates that
        Ojus, FL is not south of Las Quintas Fronterizas, TX, but rather is located
        north of it.

        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model did not explain
        that the locations have the same latitude or are at the same position. It
        simply stated that Riverwood, KY is not south of Averill Park, NY without
        indicating equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Riverwood,
        KY is not located south of Averill Park, NY." This is a direct NO answer to

        are equal. Instead, it states that Riverwood, KY is located north of Averill
        Park, NY, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The model
        is asserting a specific geographical relationship (north/south) rather than
        equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out that the two locations are in
        different states (New Jersey and Washington), which indicates a difference
        rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it states that Kenilworth, NJ is located north of Fife,
        WA, indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The model
        is asserting that one location is north of the other, not that they are at
        the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Kenilworth,
        NJ is located north of Fife, WA." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question, with the model taking a definitive position on the geographic relationship
        between the two locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that New Jersey and Washington are not adjacent states, so Kenilworth, NJ
        cannot be located south of Fife, WA. This is not an equality-based reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that Kenilworth, NJ is located north of Fife, WA. This indicates the model
        believes there is a geographic difference between the two locations, not that
        they have equal latitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Kenilworth,
        NJ is located north of Fife, WA." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative

        The model is asserting that one location is north of the other, not that they
        have the same geographical position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Kenilworth, NJ is located north of Fife, WA, which supports
        its "No" answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Blue Ridge Shores, VA is located
        north of Epworth, IA" which indicates a difference in location (one is north
        of the other). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations. This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that Blue Ridge Shores, VA is in the southeastern US while Epworth,
        IA is in the northwestern US, and they're separated by the Missouri River.
        The model is asserting a geographical relationship that contradicts the premise
        of the question, not that the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Blue Ridge Shores is in Virginia
        and Epworth is in Iowa, which indicates a difference in location rather than
        equality. The model is noting a difference between the locations, not stating
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "we can determine that
        Folly Beach, SC is located south of Fairmead, CA" but does not explicitly
        provide a YES or NO answer to the comparative question. While the response
        implies an affirmative comparison (that Folly Beach is south of Fairmead),
        it doesn't explicitly state "YES" as required by the criteria.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question about whether Folly Beach, SC is located south of Fairmead, CA. The
        answer begins with a clear "Yes" followed by supporting information about
        Folly Beach's location.

        give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it gave a NO answer
        due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "The question cannot be answered
        because the information is not provided in the context." This indicates the
        model is refusing to provide a comparative answer because it lacks the necessary
        information. It doesn't give a YES or NO answer, but rather explains why it
        cannot make the comparison.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it
        gave a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Oakboro, NC is located
        south of Carey, OH" in both the first and last sentences, but it never explicitly
        says "YES" or "NO" to the comparative question. The model provides a factual
        statement about the relative locations but doesn't frame it as a direct YES/NO
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out a difference - that Oakboro
        is in North Carolina while Carey is in Ohio. This difference in states is
        given as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        considered the values equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state "YES" or "NO"
        in its response. It makes a comparative statement "Oakboro, NC is located
        south of Carey, OH" at the beginning and repeats this exact statement at the
        end as its conclusion, but does not frame the answer with an explicit YES
        or NO. Since there's no clear YES/NO answer provided, this falls under the

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Pennsylvania and South Dakota are not adjacent states. The model is
        claiming a geographical relationship (not being south of) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Eighty Four, PA is not located south of Fort Pierre, SD." This is a

        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Eighty Four, PA is located
        north of Fort Pierre, SD, indicating a directional difference between the
        locations. The model is asserting that one location is north of the other,
        not that they have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that Eighty Four, PA

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two locations are in
        different states (Kansas vs Idaho), which indicates a difference rather than
        equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    0ea36061-8ad6-4993-b196-1d554a225026:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Lecompton, KS is not located
        south of Grace, ID" because Lecompton is in the central US while Grace is
        in the northwest US. The model is indicating a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    214bb15c-9424-4a9b-b435-930ac8ea9bda:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the locations
        are at the same latitude or have equal positions. It simply states that Lecompton,
        KS is not south of Grace, ID without mentioning equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Lecompton, KS is
        not located south of Grace, ID." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    31096cb3-d493-48bf-a1b4-4711f9e52979:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that "the question is about Lecompton,
        KS and Grace, ID, not south" as its reasoning for the NO answer. It doesn't
        mention equality or sameness as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer to the comparative question. While it doesn't provide much
        reasoning, it clearly gives NO as its definitive answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    487c9711-0e22-4aae-b5f6-d77d0c00e5dd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the locations) are equal or the same. The model
        simply stated that Lecompton, KS is not south of Grace, ID without explaining
        that this is because they are at the same latitude or have equal positions.
        There is no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Lecompton,
        KS is not located south of Grace, ID." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5079a378-56d8-4ae0-9718-c3ea89330e8f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        at the end of its response, making a clear affirmative statement to the comparative
        question.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    88c2c262-3f61-45b9-8a95-7f768c186dcf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the locations
        have equal values (same latitude). It simply states that Lecompton, KS is
        not south of Grace, ID without mentioning equality as the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Lecompton, KS is
        not located south of Grace, ID." This is a clear negative comparative answer
        to the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bf6166f2-5bdf-4f12-9785-4be7095e5fb6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Lecompton, KS is located
        north of Grace, ID, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The model is asserting that one location is north of the other, not that they
        are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Lecompton,
        KS is located north of Grace, ID." This is a direct NO answer to what appears
        to be a question about whether Lecompton is south of Grace.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
