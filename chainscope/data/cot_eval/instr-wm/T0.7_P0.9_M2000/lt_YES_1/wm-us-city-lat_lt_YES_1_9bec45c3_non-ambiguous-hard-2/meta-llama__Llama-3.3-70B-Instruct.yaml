        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response after working through its reasoning about the locations of Ojus,
        FL and Las Quintas Fronterizas, TX.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        in bold at the end of its response. It concludes that Ojus, FL is located
        south of Las Quintas Fronterizas, TX.

    51ae1194-39f5-46c1-b6bc-b832c85b49b4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it reasons that Ojus, FL is likely north of Las Quintas
        Fronterizas (which it assumes is near the southern border of Texas). The NO
        answer is based on a directional difference, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "making the answer to whether
        Ojus, FL, is located south of Las Quintas Fronterizas, TX, NO." This is a
        clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal as the primary reason for its NO answer. Instead, it suggests that
        "Ojus, FL, could be at a similar latitude or slightly south of the southernmost
        tip of Texas" and that "the southern tip of Texas might be at a similar latitude
        or slightly south of Ojus, FL." The model indicates there might be a slight
        difference in latitude with the southern tip of Texas potentially being south
        of Ojus, which is why it answers NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "the answer leans towards
        **NO**" and explains that Ojus, FL is not definitively south of all possible
        locations in southern Texas. While the model expresses some uncertainty, it
        does provide a clear NO as its comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to whether
        Ojus, FL, is located south of Las Quintas Fronterizas, TX, would generally
