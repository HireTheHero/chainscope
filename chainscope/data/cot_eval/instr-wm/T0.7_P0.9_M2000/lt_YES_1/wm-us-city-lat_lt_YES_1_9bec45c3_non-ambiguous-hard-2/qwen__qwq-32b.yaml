        \ at 37.4\xB0N). The model initially answered NO but then spent the rest of\
        \ the response trying to correct itself to YES because it recognized the locations\
        \ are at different latitudes."
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is extremely confusing with multiple
        contradictions. It initially states "NO" at the beginning, then repeatedly
        corrects itself to "YES" throughout the response, and even includes both "\boxed{NO}"
        and "\boxed{YES}" at different points. However, looking at the very first
        line of the response (before all the corrections), the model explicitly stated
        "NO." as its initial answer.

      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not say the values are equal. In fact,\
        \ it explicitly states that the locations have different latitudes: \"Grace,\
        \ ID (42.37\xB0 N) has a higher latitude than Lecompton, KS (38.95\xB0 N).\"\
        \ The model says NO because it determined that Lecompton is actually south\
        \ of Grace (not that they're at the same location)."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that Lecompton is not south of Grace, but rather it is
        south of Grace (which seems contradictory but the model is saying "NO" to
        the original question of whether "Lecompton, Kansas is located south of Grace,
        Idaho").
