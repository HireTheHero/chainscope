        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it believes
        Knightsville, IN is north of Plain, WI (not south of it). The model explicitly
        states "it's actually north of it" as the reason for the NO answer, indicating
        a directional difference rather than equality.

        (Knightsville, IN is NOT south of Plain, WI - it's actually north of it)".
        The model clearly provides a "NO" answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO, so according
        to the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after comparing the latitudes of Lecompton, Kansas and Grace, Idaho.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment that Lecompton is
        south of Grace.'
