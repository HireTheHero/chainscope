        at 40.65 degrees North vs. Colorado generally around or below 40 degrees North).
        The model is saying NO because Stirling is north of Salt Creek, not because
        they're at the same latitude.

        and concludes that "26.7 is less than 29.6." The model's reasoning indicates
        that Montura is south of Meadows Place because it has a lower latitude, not
        because the values are the same.

        is at approximately 40.5 degrees North latitude while Frankenmuth, MI is at
        approximately 43.3 degrees North latitude. The model concludes that "Orwigsburg,
        PA is located south of Frankenmuth, MI" which indicates the locations are
        at different latitudes. The model does not claim equality as the reason for
        its "NO" answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"

        at the end of its response. After analyzing the latitudes of Blue Ridge Shores,
        VA and Epworth, IA, the model concludes that Blue Ridge Shores is located
        south of Epworth and provides "YES" as its final answer.
