        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it specifically states "Coosada is actually
        north of Schall Circle" which indicates a directional difference between the
        locations. The model is saying NO because the directional relationship is
        opposite to what was asked (Schall Circle is not south of Coosada because
        Coosada is north of Schall Circle).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Schall Circle is
        further north than Coosada" which indicates a difference in their latitudes.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice at the end of
        its response, indicating that Schall Circle is NOT south of Coosada. This
        is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Coosada is actually further south than Schall
        Circle" and "This means Schall Circle is NORTH of Coosada, not south." The
        NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot give a definitive YES or
        NO answer" because it cannot verify the geographical relationship between
        the locations. It indicates it lacks information about Schall Circle's location,
        making it unable to determine the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot give a reliable YES or
        NO answer" and "I do NOT have enough information to answer this question with

        information about one of the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, but rather UNKNOWN. The

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO to this question. There is insufficient information to make
        a determination." The model indicates it cannot make the comparison because
        it cannot find a definitive location for one of the places being compared.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "If I were forced to give a YES/NO
        answer, I would say NO, but with very low confidence." However, the model
        also clearly indicates it "cannot confidently answer YES or NO" due to lack
        of information about one of the locations. The model is essentially saying
        it cannot determine the answer, which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        is much further south than Lakota" and "Lakota is significantly north of Hoback."
        The NO answer is given because the model believes the comparison is incorrect
        (it believes Hoback is south of Lakota, not that they are at the same latitude).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Peralta is east of Red Mesa, not south of it. The model identified a
        directional difference (east vs. south), not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Peralta is east of
        Red Mesa, not south of it, and explicitly concluded with "NO" at the end of

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        is based on directional difference (Peralta not being south of Red Mesa),
        not on equality of positions.

        The model is indicating a directional difference (southeast vs. south), not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared

        - that Salt Creek, CO would be "west and likely north of Stirling, NJ" rather
        than south of it. The model is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the latitudes of Salt Creek, CO and Stirling, NJ) are equal or the same.
        Instead, the model indicates uncertainty about their relative north-south
        positioning and states it "cannot definitively say" due to lacking precise
        coordinates. The NO answer appears to be a default based on uncertainty rather
        than a determination that the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model expresses uncertainty in its reasoning ("I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO"), it ultimately provides a clear "NO" as its final comparative
        result.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that Salt Creek, CO is "almost certainly NOT south of

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, the model claims that Rib Mountain
        is NORTH of Deer River (contradicting its own earlier analysis). The model
        is asserting a directional difference, not equality, as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response. However, there''s a contradiction in the model''s reasoning.
        In step 5, it says "No, Rib Mountain is located NORTH of Deer River" which
        contradicts its earlier correct analysis that Deer River is north of Rib Mountain.
        Despite this contradiction, the model''s final explicit answer is clearly
        "NO".'

      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
