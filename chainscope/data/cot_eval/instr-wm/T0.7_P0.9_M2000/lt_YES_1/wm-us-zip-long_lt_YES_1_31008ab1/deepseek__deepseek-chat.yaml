      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. It explicitly showed different longitude values (-74.65 vs -74.69)
        and stated that Chester is further west than Princeton. The NO was because
        Princeton is east of Chester, not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" after
        determining that Princeton (08562) is east of Chester (07924), not west as
        asked in the question. This is an explicit NO comparative answer.'

        this by saying "08562, NJ (Princeton Junction) is not located west of 07924,
