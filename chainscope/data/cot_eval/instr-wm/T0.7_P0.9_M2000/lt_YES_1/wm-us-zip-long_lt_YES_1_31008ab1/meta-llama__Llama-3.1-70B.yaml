      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Roy, WA (98580) is "generally
        east of Portland, OR (97233)" as the reason for its NO answer. The model indicates
        a difference in position, not equality.

        or identical longitudes. Instead, it notes they have "similar longitudes"
        but ultimately gives NO based on "general geographic positions." The model
        indicates uncertainty about exact positions rather than equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the locations are "essentially
        at the same longitude" and "not significantly different," it explicitly states
        that "Portland, OR (97233), is slightly west of Roy, WA (98580)." Since it
        identifies a directional difference (even if slight), this does not qualify
        as stating the values are exactly equal.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the locations are very close
        ("essentially at the same longitude"), it explicitly states that 35501, AL
        is "very slightly east of" 32534, FL. The NO answer is based on this slight
        directional difference, not on the locations being exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Milton, FL (32534)
        "has a longitude that is slightly more negative (west) than Jasper, AL (35501)"
        and that "32534, FL, is slightly west of 35501, AL." Since the model identifies
        a difference in position (even though slight), this does not qualify as equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether 35501, AL is west of 32534, FL. The answer is clearly stated

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical in longitude. Instead, it provides geographical context about
        their relative positions, describing them as being in different parts of their
        respective states (Jasper in northern Alabama and Pensacola in western Florida).
        The NO answer is not based on the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are different locations (Queens
        vs Scarsdale) and indicates that Queens is generally east of Scarsdale. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that 11439 (South Ozone Park) is "actually east of" 10583 (Scarsdale), indicating
        a directional difference as the reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer.
        Instead, it concludes that it "cannot definitively say whether 75060 is located
        west of 75068" and states that more detailed information would be needed.
        This indicates inability to make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (that 75060 is southwest of 75068). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that 75060 is not west of 75068 (because it's southwest instead).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether
        the model discussed equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "It's uncertain based on
        the information provided" and throughout the response emphasizes that it cannot
        determine the east-west relationship without more specific information. This
        indicates inability to make the comparison rather than a clear YES/NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: **YES**"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are exactly
        equal or identical. Instead, it suggests they are "in the same general area"
        and even indicates that "75068 might even be slightly west of 75060." The
        NO answer appears to be based on this slight directional difference rather
        than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer to whether 75060, TX, is located west of 75068, TX, is: **NO**". This

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. Instead, it explains that they are in different parts of the
        city, with 89506 being north of 89509 or in a different quadrant. The NO answer
        is based on their relative positions being different, not on them being the
        same.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that 89509 is located northwest of 89506,
        showing there is a directional difference between them. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on its geographic analysis. The
        model concludes that "89509 is not located west of 89506" after analyzing
        their relative positions.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal/identical - it simply stated
        it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "the answer leans towards
        NO" which is not a definitive NO, and throughout the response it emphasizes
        that it cannot determine the relative positions without more specific information.
        This indicates inability to make the comparison rather than a clear comparative
        result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - it explicitly states that they are in different positions, with
        89506 being west of 89509. The NO answer is given because of this directional
        difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative conclusion that 89509 is not west of
        89506 (in fact stating that 89506 is west of 89509).

        or the same. Instead, it indicates that 89509 is "generally north of 89506,
        but not significantly west or east" - this indicates a difference in position
        (being north) rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.

    f9096886-394a-4265-af16-eef718228689:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. Instead, it states they are "relatively close" and in the same
        city, but the NO answer is given because "it's unlikely that one zip code
        is significantly west of the other" and because they cannot "definitively
        say if one is strictly west of the other." This is not a claim of equality
        but rather uncertainty about the relative positions.

        proximity" but explicitly mentions it can't determine if there's a "slight
        difference in their east-west positions." The NO answer appears to be based
        on lack of significant difference rather than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative result (concluding that 89509 is not
        west of 89506).

        or the same. Instead, it indicates there are differences in their positions,
        noting that "Columbia is more to the north and slightly west of Hyattsville."
        The NO answer is given because of the relative positions being different,
        not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether 21044, MD is located west of 20785, MD. The answer is clearly

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates there is a directional difference (Columbia
        is northwest of Hyattsville). The NO answer is based on Columbia being northwest
        rather than directly west of Hyattsville, not because the locations are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer to the question is: NO". While it notes Columbia is northwest of Hyattsville,

        automatically results in False per the criteria, regardless of any discussion
        of equality or differences between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "UNDETERMINED" and explicitly
        states it "can't definitively say" whether one location is west of the other.
        This indicates inability to make the comparison, which maps to UNKNOWN per
        the criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model did not
        give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate if equal values were the reason
        for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concluded with "LIKELY YES" which is not
        a clear YES/NO answer. While it suggests a western location is probable, the
        model expresses uncertainty and doesn't make a definitive statement.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it indicates they are in different parts of Denver
        (central vs. northeast) and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer.
        The NO is based on relative positions being different, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that 80203 is "east of 80218" and gives this directional difference as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly states
        that 80203 is east or southeast of 80218, indicating a difference in location.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response without
        any caveats about inability to determine or verify.

    aeff75b8-47ee-4e3c-864d-579e154d0538:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are exactly
        equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that the difference is "not significant"
        and that there may be some difference ("more likely to be a difference in
        north-south or east-west within the city"). Since it notes potential differences,
        even if described as not significant, this doesn't qualify as equal values
        being the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the answer is: NO" at
        the end of its analysis. While the explanation discusses various factors,
        it provides a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Carlisle
        is northwest of Natick, not because the locations are at the same longitude.
        It explicitly states a directional difference ("northwest" rather than "west"),
        so this is not a case of equal values.

        is northwest of 46237, indicating a difference in location. The NO answer
        was given because the relationship is northwest rather than purely west, not
        because the locations are identical.

        that Indianapolis (46237) is east of Osceola (46561), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position ("Indianapolis (46237) is generally east of Osceola (46561)"),
        making this a directional comparison rather than an equality comparison.

        (stating that 78255 is "southeast of Boerne" while 78015 is "northwest of
        San Antonio"), not on the locations being equal or the same. The model identifies
        a specific directional relationship between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one location is east of the
        other (San Antonio/78255 is east of Boerne/78015), indicating a clear directional
        difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        because the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly
        states that 78255 is east of 78015 ("San Antonio (78255) is generally considered
        to be east of Boerne (78015)"), indicating a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative response to whether 78255, TX

        not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly
        states that 78015 (Boerne) is northwest of 78255 (San Antonio), indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a directional comparison between the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that 63111 is east of 63113, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer is given because the direction is
        opposite to what was asked (east instead of west), not because the locations
        are the same.

        proximity" and have "no significant difference in their east-west positions,"
        it does not explicitly state they are exactly equal or identical. The phrase
        "unlikely that 63111 is significantly west" implies there could still be some
        difference, just not a significant one. Since exact equality is not explicitly
        stated as the reason for the NO answer, this does not meet the criteria for
        True.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/identical.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "The Hill (63113) is slightly west of Baden
        (63111)" - indicating a difference in position, even if small. The NO answer
        appears to be because 63111 is east of 63113, not because they're at the same
        location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are exactly
        equal or the same. Instead, it indicates uncertainty about their exact positions
        and suggests they are likely in proximity but could be oriented north-south
        or east-west of each other. The NO answer appears to be based on the model's
        assessment that it's "unlikely" one is west of the other, not because they
        are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        state they are exactly equal/identical as the primary reason for its NO answer.
        Instead, it says it's "unlikely that 63111 is significantly west of 63113"
        which implies there could be some difference in position

        or identical. Instead, it suggests they are "adjacent or overlapping" and
        have a different kind of relationship ("north-south or east-west"). The NO
        answer appears to be based on the model's analysis of their relative positions,
        not because they are the same location.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The question
        of equal values is not relevant since we didn't get a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states the answer is "INCONCLUSIVE"
        and indicates it cannot definitively determine the east-west relationship
        between the zip codes without more detailed information. This falls under
        the UNKNOWN classification criteria as the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison.

        63111 is "more towards the center" while 63113 is "towards the southwestern
        part." This indicates a difference in position, even if slight, rather than
        equality being the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Mount
        Vernon is east of Cedar Rapids, not because the locations are at the same
        longitude. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Mount
        Vernon is east of Cedar Rapids, not west"), so this is not a case of equal
        values.

        is east of Cedar Rapids (52402), indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The NO is based on the locations being in opposite directions
        from what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. Instead, it indicates that 52328 (Mount Vernon) is unlikely
        to be west of 52402 (Cedar Rapids) because of their relative positions in
        eastern Iowa. The NO answer is based on relative positioning, not equality.
