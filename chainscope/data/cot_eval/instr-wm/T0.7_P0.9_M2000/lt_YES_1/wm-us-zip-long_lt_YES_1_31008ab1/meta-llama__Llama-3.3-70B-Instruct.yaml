        somewhat east/southeast compared to 10583." This directional difference, even
        if slight, means the NO answer was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the zip codes. The answer
        is explicitly stated and represents a clear comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that 11439
        is southeast of 10583, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        locations. The NO was based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or position. Instead, it indicates that Queens (11439)
        is "south and slightly west" of Scarsdale (10583), acknowledging a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on Queens not being "significantly west"
        rather than the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when considering the west directional relationship, providing a clear comparative
        result.

        southeast of North Reading" and that North Reading is "north and somewhat
        west of Boston". The NO answer is given because one location is east of the
        other, not because they are at the same location.

        noting that Charleston, WV (25314) is "generally southeast of Independence,
        OH (44131)". The NO was based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "the answer to
        whether 25314, WV is located west of 44131, OH is NO" - this is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        West Virginia is generally southeast of Ohio, making it unlikely for the WV
        location to be west of the OH location. The model never claims the locations
        have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to whether
        25314, WV is located west of 44131, OH is likely NO" as its final conclusion.
        While it uses the word "likely," it still provides a clear NO as its comparative

        could be "slightly east" of 38305. The model does not state they are exactly
        equal as the reason for the NO answer. Rather, the NO appears to be because

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that NO is the answer because the locations
        are aligned more north-south than east-west relative to each other, indicating
        a difference in position rather than equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it's based on the fact that the locations have different positions (northwest
        vs west). The model explicitly states there is a directional difference (northwest
        instead of directly west), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer would be NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explains that NC would
        be north or northwest of FL, implying different positions. The NO is based
        on directional differences, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the answer to whether

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that 16214 PA
        is "east or northeast" of 24416 VA, indicating a directional difference rather
        than equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was based on Pennsylvania
        being northeast of Virginia, indicating a directional difference. The model
        explicitly states that Pennsylvania is northeast of Virginia and cannot be
        west of Virginia due to their relative positions.

        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference in longitude values
        (-121.166 vs -121.274) and concluded NO because Lodi was found to be west
        of Granite Bay.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that Lodi is "slightly
        east of Granite Bay due to the layout of the Central Valley" - indicating
        a difference in east-west position, even if slight. The presence of any stated

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because Conroe is "generally southwest
        of Crockett" - indicating a directional difference, not equality. Even though
        this might seem contradictory to the question about being west, we must take
        the explicit NO answer and the stated directional difference at face value.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        being "southwest" and in a "different direction" relative to 75801. The NO
        answer is based on directional differences, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice in its conclusion,
        and while the explanation is somewhat convoluted, it maintains this as its
        comparative answer. The model does not indicate inability to determine or
        reject premises, but rather provides a specific directional assessment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (with 77320 being east/southeast of 75801), not because
        they are equal. The model explicitly states a directional difference between

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Osceola is "north and slightly west" of Indianapolis, not because the locations
        are equal. It specifically notes there is a directional difference, with the
        primary direction being north rather than west. Even though the western component

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it specifically states that 11976, NY is "southeast of Connecticut"
        and "not west but rather southwest or directly south of 06415, CT". The NO
        answer is based on directional differences, not equality.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicated that Riverhead, NY is generally
        east of where Colchester, CT is situated, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether the NY location is west of the CT location.
        This was a clear, unambiguous negative response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or otherwise equal in position. Instead, it concludes NO
        because it determines that 11976, NY is actually east of 06415, CT (stating
        "11976, NY (Water Mill, on Long Island) is likely east of 06415, CT (Colchester),
        not west"). Since the NO is based on a directional difference rather than
        equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether 11976, NY is located west of 06415, CT. The answer
        is given directly and definitively, not as an inability to determine or verify.

        in fact, it explicitly states that 11976 is east of 06415. The NO answer is
        given because one location is east of the other, not because they are at the
        same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on its reasoning that one
        location would be east of the other due to state positions. The model actually
        suggests a difference in positions (NY being west of CT), making this a directional
        comparison rather than an equality comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer would
        be NO" as its final comparative answer. While it shows some uncertainty about
        specific locations, it provides a clear NO answer based on general state positions.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the distinction between
        the locations is "subtle" and they are both in "northeastern Ohio," it does
        not state they are equal or the same. Instead, it notes differences in their
        positions (one being more southward) and explicitly states that 44621 is "not
        significantly west" of 44023. The NO answer is based on directional differences,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes or locations
        are equal/identical/the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines
        44621 is "southeast or in a direction that is not west of 44023" - indicating
        a directional difference, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer, but not because the
        locations are equal/same. Instead, it specifically states that Louisville
        (44621) is "generally south or southwest of Chagrin Falls (44023) rather than
        strictly west" - indicating a directional difference as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Based on this

        is "not significantly west" and is "north and slightly west" of Brooklyn,
        acknowledging a difference (even if slight) in their east-west positions.
        The NO answer is primarily based on the fact that the north-south difference
        is more significant than the east-west difference, not because they are at
        the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to

        a difference in position (specifically that Georgia is "to the southeast (and
        thus generally east) of Ohio"). Since it identifies a directional difference
        rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer, this should be classified
        as False.

        that Palmdale is east of Whittier, not because the locations are at the same
        longitude. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Palmdale
        is actually east of Whittier") and does not claim the locations are equal
        or the same.

        east" than Whittier (90602), indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        it explicitly states that Whittier (90602) is "more westward" than Palmdale
        (93552). The NO answer is based on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to

        or identical longitudes. Instead, it suggests that Whittier is "slightly more
        to the west" and that the difference is "not by a significant margin." Any
        difference, even if described as slight, means this is not a case of equal
        values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with a boxed "NO" as
        its final answer. While the analysis shows some uncertainty and mentions this
        is a "close call," it ultimately provides a clear NO response.

        of Kentucky" and "to the south and slightly to the east of Kentucky, not west."
        This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after reasoning about the geographical locations, concluding
        that 36054, AL is not west of 42122, KY.

        Carolina.

        a different part of the city" from 63111. The NO answer appears to be based
        on the model's analysis that 63111 is not strictly west of 63113, rather than
        them being in the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer
        on reasoning about zip code proximity and likely geographical relationships.
        The model suggests the areas are "relatively close" but does not claim they
        are at the same longitude or exactly equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it includes caveats about uncertainty. Since it provides a clear NO
        answer as its comparative conclusion (not saying it cannot determine or verify),
        this should be classified as NO.

        specific boundaries" and likely "close to each other." The NO answer appears
        to be based on insufficient directional information rather than equality of
        position.

        it give equality as the reason for its NO answer. The NO appears to be based
        on inability to determine relative positions rather than confirmed equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        despite expressing uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides this clear
        NO answer (not "NO, I cannot verify" or similar), this should be classified
        as NO rather than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave NO as an answer because it determined that Maryland
        (20616) is east of Virginia (22206), indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The NO was based on a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether 22206, VA is west of 20616, MD. This was a clear

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one location is northwest
        of the other, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is given
        because Salley, SC is "more to the north than to the west" of Jacksonville,
        FL, not because the locations are the same.

        one location is "north or slightly northwest" of the other, and says NO because
        it's not "strictly west." Since it notes a directional difference (even if
        slight), this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states that 08562 is "east or southeast of 07924",
        indicating a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the answer is: NO" after
        concluding that "08562 (Cranbury) is generally east or southeast of 07924
        (Bernardsville)"'

    fcbdba4d-ab28-4d09-86b2-6f3c6ee8de82:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Princeton Junction (08562)
        is east of Bernardsville (07924), indicating a directional difference. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides a definitive comparative result, indicating that 08562 is not
        west of 07924. This is a clear NO answer to the comparison question.'
