      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a final NO conclusion, so the question of whether values are
        equal is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response appears to be incomplete and
        ends mid-thought without providing a clear final YES/NO answer. While it explores
        various possibilities and at one point says "So the answer is YES," it continues
        to question and revise its thinking afterward, showing uncertainty and never
        reaching a definitive conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that Queens (11439)
        is southeast of Westchester (10583), indicating a directional difference.
        The NO is based on 11439 being east of 10583, not because they're at the same
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a clear comparative conclusion
        that 11439 is east (not west) of 10583.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        11439 is east of 10583, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO is based on the opposite direction being true (east
        instead of west), not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 11439, NY is east of
        10583, NY" as its final answer. This is a direct comparative answer indicating
        that the first location is not west of the second location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. Rather, it explicitly states that 75060 is east of 75068
        due to the numerical difference (75060 < 75068) and the pattern of zip codes
        increasing from east to west. The model describes a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer with bold emphasis. The model provides
        a definitive comparative answer based on zip code numbering patterns.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a specific comparative
        reasoning based on longitude values showing that 75060 is east (not west)
        of 75068.

        Irving (75060), indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so the question of whether values
        are equal is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-thought without providing
        a clear YES/NO conclusion. While it explores various possibilities and geographical
        relationships, it never arrives at a definitive answer about whether 75060
        is west of 75068. The response shows uncertainty throughout and ends incomplete.

        never made a comparison of equal values since it didn't complete its analysis.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through its thought process but never
        actually provides a YES/NO answer to the comparison question. It only explains
        how it would approach finding the answer by looking up coordinates, but doesn't
        reach a conclusion.

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and cuts off
        mid-analysis. The model did not reach a final YES/NO conclusion about whether
        one location is west of the other. While it started analyzing the zip codes,
        it never completed the comparison or stated a final answer.

        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" multiple times as
        its final answer, both at the end of its thinking process and in its formal

        are at the same longitude. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference ("central Pennsylvania lies east of western New York").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        different (-97.8783 vs -98.0046) and used this difference to conclude that
        73703 is east of 78737. The NO answer was based on one location being east
        of the other, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation that 73703 is east of 78737 based

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-thought without providing
        a final YES/NO conclusion. While it discusses various geographical points
        and coordinates, it never reaches a definitive answer about whether 32776

        never reached a final NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model goes through extensive reasoning and
        at one point says "Therefore, the answer would be YES", it then continues

        conclusive answer. The response ends without a clear YES/NO statement.

        The model never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate if equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never actually
        provides a clear YES/NO answer about whether 85746 is west of 85745. The model

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The question of
        whether values are equal is not relevant since the model did not give a NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete, cutting off
        mid-sentence. However, in the last complete paragraph, the model explicitly
        states "the answer is YES" and provides reasoning for this conclusion based
        on zip code patterns and geographical knowledge. Despite earlier uncertainty
        and conflicting reasoning, it ultimately commits to a YES answer.

        the ZIP codes were in the same location - it spent time trying to determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a clear final conclusion. The model considers multiple possibilities (if 53597
        is west of Madison then NO, if east then YES) but doesn't definitively choose
        one. The response actually cuts off mid-sentence without providing a final

        53705 (Madison) is EAST of 53597 (which it placed in the southwestern region),
        indicating a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and stated
        "53705, WI is not west of 53597, WI" as its final comparative answer. The
        answer was clear and definitive, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning about various
        possibilities but never reaches a definitive conclusion. It considers multiple
        scenarios where 53597 could be either east or west of Madison (53705), exploring
        different towns and their coordinates, but ultimately does not commit to a

      explanation_equal_values: "While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not\
        \ because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the longitudes\
        \ are different (-122.1633\xB0 vs -121.7683\xB0) and uses this difference\
        \ to conclude that Livermore is east of Palo Alto. The NO answer is based\
        \ on this directional difference, not on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer, indicating that 94549 is not west of 94303. The
        answer is definitive and comparative, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: "The model gives a NO answer because it found different\
        \ longitude values (-122.05\xB0W vs -122.14\xB0W) and explicitly states that\
        \ one location is west of the other. The NO is not due to equal values, but\
        \ rather because one location is explicitly east of the other."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation comparing the longitudes of the
        two locations and concluding that 94549 is east (not west) of 94303.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the ZIP codes are at
        the same location or have equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that
        94549 (Dublin) is east of 94303 (Palo Alto), indicating a clear directional
        difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both after its thinking process and in its formal conclusion.
        This NO is a direct comparative result stating that 94549 is not west of 94303.

        \ and the NO is based on 94549 being east (not equal to) 94303."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that 94549 is not west of 94303,
        with specific longitude values to support this answer.

    dd17d1ff-fef2-454b-aad0-4d52ce40c10f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with 94303 (Palo Alto) being west of 94549 (East Bay). The model's reasoning
        is based on geographical differences, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion based on geographical analysis.
        The answer is explicitly stated and relates to the comparative question.

    650fce71-64c2-4776-9168-badc48291089:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that New Market's
        longitude (-83.55) is different from Milan's longitude (-83.68), and uses
        this difference to conclude that New Market is actually east of Milan. The
        NO is based on finding a difference in the opposite direction of what was
        asked, not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that the first location is
        not west of the second location. The model provides specific reasoning based
        on longitude coordinates to support this answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        The model was doing calculations and comparisons but never reached a final
        conclusion of equality or inequality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-thought
        without providing a final YES/NO conclusion. While the model does extensive
        analysis of longitudes and locations, it never reaches or states a definitive
        answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        longitude values (-83.1957 vs -83.6824) and explicitly stating that one location
        is east of the other. The model does not claim the values are equal or approximately
        equal as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a definitive comparative answer based on its longitude

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because it determines 37853 (at
        83.2W) is east of 48130 (at 83.68W), not because they are equal. It explicitly
        states there is a difference in values ("83.2 is less than 83.68") and uses
        this difference to conclude one location is east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, 37853 would NOT
        be west of 48130" which is an explicit NO answer to whether the first zip
        code is west of the second. While there is uncertainty in the reasoning, the
        final comparative conclusion is clearly stated.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        \ showing a clear difference in values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation of why one location is east of the
        other based on their longitudes.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
        The equal values criteria only needs to be evaluated for responses with a
        final answer of NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a clear final YES/NO conclusion. The model keeps going back and forth between
        possibilities, considering different locations and longitudes, but ends mid-thought
        while still contemplating alternatives ("Alternatively, if I consider that
        37853 is in Roane County, TN, which is more towards"). Without a clear final
        answer, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        regardless of any equality comparisons that might have been discussed.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-thought without providing
        a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model appears confused and keeps second-guessing
        its geographical knowledge, ultimately not reaching a definitive answer about
        which ZIP code is further west.

        the zip codes were at the same location - it was trying to determine their
        relative positions but couldn't reach a conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a clear final answer. While
        it considers answering "NO" at several points based on different possible

      explanation_final_answer: While the response contains extensive analysis and
        multiple hypotheticals, it never explicitly states a final YES/NO answer.
        The analysis ends with a tentative conclusion that "63113 would be west of
        63111, making 63111 east of 63113, so the answer is NO" but this is presented

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 92307 (Adelanto) is east of
        92108 (San Diego), indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that 92307 is not west of
        92108. The model provides a definitive comparative result.

        The model never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate if equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response shows extensive reasoning but
        never reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion. The response ends mid-thought while
        still trying to work out the relative positions using coordinates, showing
        confusion and uncertainty throughout. The model does not make a final comparative
        determination.

    3ca627f7-de49-488e-b8b7-87fdc4ba32f8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly noted a difference in longitude
        values (-91.23 vs -91.67) and stated that one location was east of the other.
        The NO answer was based on the first location being east rather than west
        of the second location, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a definitive comparative result based on the longitude
        values it cited (-91.23 vs -91.67). The answer is reinforced with geographical
        reasoning about the relative positions of Oxford Junction and Cedar Rapids.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear final answer with supporting longitude coordinates showing 52328 (Blairstown)
        is west of 52402 (Cedar Rapids)

    b1ad78cb-6b91-4df0-babc-d0592cc35a54:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (52328 being east of 52402), not because the locations are equal. The model
        explicitly states there is a difference based on the ZIP code numbers (523
        vs 524) and concludes one is east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that 52328
        is east (not west) of 52402.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        question only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response after analyzing the locations and concluding that Garrison

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the final answer isn't NO
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        and provided a clear explanation confirming that 52328 (Vining) is west of
        52402 (Cedar Rapids)

        ), indicating a difference in values. The NO was because Princeton Junction\
        \ is east of Chester, not because they're at the same longitude."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion that Princeton Junction (08562)
        is east of Chester (07924), not west of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but explicitly states
        different longitude values (-74.65 vs -74.69) and explains that Chester is
        west of Princeton. The NO is because one location is east of the other, not
        because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that 08562 is not west of 07924, providing specific
        longitude values and reasoning.

    9fa2723c-6599-4928-9af4-743ff30af214:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - it explicitly stated that one location was
        east of the other (Plainsboro is southeast of Chester). The NO was based on
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that 08562 is

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear explanation supporting that 08562 is west of 07924, citing specific
        longitude values (-74.66 vs -74.57) and explaining why the more negative value

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The question
        of equal values is not relevant since there was no NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        actually provides a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers "perhaps the answer
        is YES" at one point, this is immediately followed by more uncertainty and
        alternative scenarios. The response ends without making a definitive comparative
        conclusion.
