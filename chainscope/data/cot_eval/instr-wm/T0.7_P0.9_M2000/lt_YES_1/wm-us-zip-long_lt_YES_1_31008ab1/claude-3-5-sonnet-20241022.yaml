      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly stated "Roy is actually slightly EAST of Portland", indicating
        a difference in position. Even though the difference is described as slight,
        any stated difference means this is not an equality-based NO.

        Jasper", indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making a definitive comparative judgment about
        their relative positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that Pensacola is further west than Jasper.
        The model describes a clear directional difference between the locations,
        saying Pensacola "extends further west than Jasper's location".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (with Jasper being east of Pensacola),
        not because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states one is
        "east of" the other, indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that 35501 (Jasper) is east of 32534 (Pensacola), not west of it. This is

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference ("Scarsdale (10583) is slightly west of Queens (11439)") and uses
        this difference as the reason for its NO answer, not because the locations
        are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that 11439 is east of 10583, not west of it.

        - instead, it explicitly states that 11439 is EAST of 10583, indicating a
        directional difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (11439 is not west
        of 10583)" as its final comparative answer, providing a clear negative response
        to the comparison.

      result: 'NO'
    7d67ae8d-5ade-44cf-8e53-699143bea3b6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - it explicitly states that one location is east
        of the other, indicating a difference in position. The NO is because the relationship
        is opposite to what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear directional explanation that 11439
        is east of 10583, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (one location being east of the other), not because the locations have equal
        coordinates. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a directional reasoning
        (that 11439 is east, not west, of 10583)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    92172c22-eb65-4dae-873e-0c46231e3a5b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        11439 is EAST of 10583, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        in its conclusion, providing a definitive comparative answer that 11439 is
        not west of 10583, but rather east of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the NO was given because Queens was
        explicitly stated to be EAST of Scarsdale, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Queens
        is east of Scarsdale, not west.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Queens is to the east
        of Scarsdale, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        NO answer was based on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the east-west positions of the two locations,
        where it determined that 11439 (Queens) is east of 10583 (Scarsdale).

        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Charleston (25314) is east of Independence (44131), not west. This is
        a direct comparative answer.

        east of Independence, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly states
        there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Charleston
        is east of Independence (a directional difference), not because the locations
        are at the same longitude. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference ("Charleston is actually EAST of Independence"), so this is not
        a case of equal values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that one location must
        be east of the other (due to state geography), making it impossible for the
        first to be west of the second. The model identifies a specific directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after walking through its reasoning steps. This is a direct comparative
        answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying that 70128 is east of 39047. The NO answer is given because of this
        directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        is east of the other, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was
        based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, with a clear directional explanation. While the model appears to contradict
        its own reasoning (first saying LA is west of MS, then concluding the specific
        locations are actually east), it still provides a definitive NO answer.

        \ is given because the model concludes Vero Beach is east of Denton, not because\
        \ the locations have equal coordinates."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 32962 (Vero Beach,
        FL) is NOT west of 27299 (Denton, NC)" as its final comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        it explicitly states that "Vero Beach is actually slightly EAST of Thomasville"
        indicating a difference in position, even if slight. This difference is the
        reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Vero Beach is "slightly EAST of
        Thomasville". This difference in position, even though described as "slightly",
        means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result with explanation that
        32962 is not west of 27299, but rather east of it.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal - the model explicitly states that "Vero Beach is
        actually slightly EAST of Thomasville," indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the east-west positions of the two locations, finding that
        Vero Beach is slightly east of Thomasville.

        close to the same longitude line", it explicitly states there is a difference,
        with Vero Beach being "slightly EAST of Thomasville". Since the model identifies
        a directional difference (even if slight) rather than stating the locations
        are exactly equal, this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on its analysis
        that Vero Beach is slightly east of Thomasville.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly stated that "Alabama is actually slightly EAST of Indiana"
        and used this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer. Even
        though the difference is described as "slight," any stated difference means
        this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a clear comparative result based on its geographical analysis.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that 35116 is EAST of 47905. The NO is because
        they have a different relative position (east vs west), not because they are
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative result, explaining that 35116 is east of 47905, not west of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal. While it notes they are in a "very similar longitudinal range,"
        it explicitly states that Lafayette, IN is "slightly west of Birmingham, AL"
        and concludes that 35116 is "actually east of it." This indicates a difference
        in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 35116, AL is not
        located west of 47905, IN" as a clear comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it explicitly noted that Alabama is "significantly east of Indiana"
        and that Indiana "lies northwest of Alabama", indicating a clear directional
        difference as the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (35116, AL
        is not located west of 47905, IN)" as a clear comparative answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - instead, it explicitly stated there was a directional difference,
        noting that Alabama is "to the south and east of Indiana" and concluded NO
        based on this directional difference, not based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on the locations being
        in opposite directions from what was asked (Alabama being east of Indiana,
        not west), not because the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly
        stated there was a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - instead, it explicitly states that 71006 is EAST of 50023, indicating a
        difference in location. The NO appears to be rejecting some unstated premise
        about westward positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical

        location is east of the other (indicating a difference in position), not because
        the locations are equal or the same. It specifically states "77320 (Huntsville)
        is EAST of 75801 (Palestine), not west".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        NO" as its final answer, making a definitive comparative judgment.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Huntsville is "slightly southeast
        of Palestine" and uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO
        answer. Any directional difference, even if described as "slight", means the
        values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        and explicitly concludes "77320 is NOT west of 75801", making this an unambiguous
        NO answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a directional difference, saying Port Reading (08863) is EAST of West
        Orange (07068). The NO was because the relationship was opposite to what was

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Port Reading being
        east of Roseland (a directional difference), not because the locations are
        at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

    fc33f530-d136-445c-ba8e-fa8fae838f38:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Port
        Reading is slightly EAST of Upper Montclair, not because the locations are
        at the same longitude. It explicitly notes a difference in position ("slightly
        EAST"), even though the difference is described as small.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making a definitive comparative judgment that
        Port Reading is slightly east of Upper Montclair.

        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have different positions,
        with Georgia being EAST of Ohio (opposite to what was apparently being asked).
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"

        same longitude," it immediately qualifies this by noting that "97459 being
        slightly east if anything." Any noted difference, even if described as slight,
        means we cannot classify this as equal values being the reason for the NO
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        it actually specifies that North Bend is "slightly east" of Ocean Park and
        explains that the curve of the coastline means Washington's coast extends
        further west. This difference in position, even though described as "slight,"
        means the values are not equal.

        explicitly state they are at exactly the same longitude or that they are equal.
        The language suggests very small but existing differences ("almost," "not

        - it explicitly states that Lakebay is "notably further west than Tigard"
        and describes specific geographical differences in their positions. The NO
        is because Lakebay is west of Tigard, not because they're at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates

        relative position difference (whether "slightly to the west" or "slightly
        east"), indicating the values are not equal. Any difference, even if described
        as "slight," means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, followed by a clarification of the relative positions. While there
        appears to be a contradiction in the conclusion (saying it's "slightly east"
        after previously saying "slightly to the west"), we take the explicit "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that 63111 is "slightly east of 63113" - it explicitly states a directional
        difference between the locations, not equality. Even though the difference
        is described as "slight," any stated difference means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, without any caveats
        about uncertainty or inability to determine.
