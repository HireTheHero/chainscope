      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - rather, it explicitly states that 98580 is east of 97233 (indicating
        a difference in position). The NO is based on the opposite directional relationship
        being true, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result to whether 98580 is west of 97233. The
        answer is explicit and definitive.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying "Chelan County (98580) is further east than Portland (97233)" and gives
        this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 5 and once as a final standalone answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it determined that 10583 is west of 11439,
        indicating a difference in location. The NO was based on this directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "So the answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, making this a definitive NO answer to the comparison
        question. The model provides a clear directional reasoning that 24151 is southwest
        (not purely west) of 15104.

        that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Virginia
        is "generally located south and east of Pennsylvania" and concludes that the
        Virginia zip code would NOT be west of the Pennsylvania zip code. The NO is
        based on relative positions, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer, specifically
        that West Virginia is east of Ohio, making the WV zip code NOT west of the
        OH zip code. Since the NO is based on a directional difference rather than
        equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, making this a definitive NO answer to the comparison
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that 70128 is east of 39047), not because the locations are at the
        same longitude. The model explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct answer based
        on its geographical analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (with 70128 being east of 39047), not
        because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparative analysis

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 70128 is east of 39047, indicating
        a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly states that New
        Orleans (70128) is east of the Mississippi zip code (39047), indicating a
        difference in position. The NO answer was given because of this directional
        difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Florida is east of North Carolina, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO is because one location is east of the other, not because they're at the
        same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        11510 is east of 12123, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO is based on one location being east of the other, not
        because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result that 11510 is NOT west of 12123. The

        locations are equal. The model explicitly states that 44621 is "actually west
        of 44023" and describes different locations (one being "more centrally located"
        and the other being "further east and north"). The NO answer is given because
        the relationship is reversed from what was asked, not because the locations
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with additional confirmation "(44621 is NOT located west of
        44023)". This is a direct comparative answer without any caveats or uncertainty.

        based on the zip code numbers, indicating a difference in location. The NO
        answer was due to this directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, 44621, OH

        (east instead of west), not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        location. The answer is definitive and matches the format of a clear comparative
        NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined that 43162, OH is west of 30646, GA (indicating a difference
        in location). The model never stated or implied the locations were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - instead, it explicitly notes a difference, stating that 91764 is east of
        91701. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis
        of the zip code locations.

        locations were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 91764 is EAST of
        91701 (opposite of what was asked), basing this on the difference in numbers
        (64 vs 01). The model identified a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Florida is explicitly stated to be east of Kentucky, indicating a difference
        in position. The model states "Florida is east of Kentucky" as its reason
        for NO.

        state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states
        that Florida is east of Kentucky, indicating a difference in location. The
        NO answer is based on the fact that one location is east of the other, not
        because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct response to whether one location

        92307 is east of 92108, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states there is a directional difference ("92307 is east of 92108") and uses
        this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is east of the other (a directional difference), not because the
        locations have equal coordinates. The model explicitly states "19087 (PA)
        is actually east of 19947 (DE)" indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparative analysis
        showing one location is east of the other, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that one location is east of the
        other (specifically that NH zip code is EAST of the MA zip code). The NO answer
        is given because of this directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that 03869 is NOT located west of
        01938. The answer is definitive and explicitly stated.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        one location is east of the other, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO was given because the relationship was in the opposite direction of what
        was asked.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it does not
        state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states
        that one location is east of the other (South Carolina is east of Florida),
        making them different. The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result stating that 29829 is NOT west of 32220.
        The answer is definitive and directly addresses the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined that the SC zip code would be east of the FL zip code,
        indicating a difference in position (just in the opposite direction of what
        was being asked).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographic analysis showing
        that the SC zip code would be east, not west, of the FL zip code.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the directional
        relationship between the locations (SC being east of FL), not because the
        locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its

        52328 based on zip code analysis, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 52328 is lower than 52402 and
        concludes that 52328 is east of 52402 (indicating a difference in location).
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question of whether 52328, IA is located west
