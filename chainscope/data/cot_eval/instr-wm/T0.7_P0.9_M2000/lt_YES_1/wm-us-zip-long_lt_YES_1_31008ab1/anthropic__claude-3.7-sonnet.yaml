      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "98580 (Roy, WA)
        is actually located slightly EAST of 97233 (Portland area, OR), not west."
        The model is noting a directional difference (slightly east), not equality,
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a "NO" answer, then realized
        it made an error, and reaffirmed "NO" but with a corrected explanation. The
        final answer is clearly stated as "NO" at the end of the response.

    0603b8c0-2fea-497e-aa01-2869a6fabced:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer because the values being compared are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a "NO" answer, but then reconsidered
        and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer after reviewing the locations
        more carefully. The final conclusion was "YES" that 35501, AL is located west
        of 32534, FL.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer based on equal values; it actually gave a YES answer
        based on Glen Ellyn having a slightly larger western longitude value.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer after checking the
        precise coordinates. The final determination was that Glen Ellyn is located
        west of Grayslake.

        Lakemoor (60046)" and further clarifies "It is east and south of Lakemoor."
        The model is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 60137 (Glen Ellyn)

        west than Grayslake (60046)" and described their different positions relative
        to Chicago and Lake Michigan. The model clearly indicated a difference in
        the east-west positioning of these locations, not equality. The NO answer
        contradicts the model's own reasoning, but nowhere did it claim the locations
        have equal longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear, explicit NO answer to the question of whether 60137,
        IL is west of 60046, IL. However, this appears to contradict the model's own
        reasoning, as it stated "Glen Ellyn (60137) is further west than Grayslake
        (60046)" right before giving the NO answer. Despite this contradiction, I

      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO, so according
        to the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, 45807, OH (Delphos)
        is located west of 45459, OH (Dayton)" as its final answer.

    e328a6d8-a7dd-4055-97c8-3b8e41a4beb0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 45807 would be northeast
        of 45459, not west. The model is indicating a directional difference (northeast
        vs. west), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially says "NO" but then corrects itself
        twice. In its final statement, it clearly says "The answer is NO." This is
        an explicit NO answer to the comparative question of whether zip code 45807,
        OH is located west of zip code 45459, OH.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    11bba4cf-4fef-4987-8608-2e84f2d41b2f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        Additionally, the model did not claim the values were equal - it actually
        claimed they have different relative positions (one being east of the other).
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is contradictory. It first
        states "NO" as a clear answer, but then in the following paragraph contradicts
        itself by saying "70128, LA is not located west of 39047, MS. It's actually
        east of it..." This contradiction makes the final answer unclear, as the model
        seems to be confused about the geographical relationship between the locations.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that 70128 "is actually east of"
        39047, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 70128 (New Orleans
        East, LA) is not located west of 39047 (Canton, MS)." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides a different directional relationship as
        the reason for the NO answer, stating "It's actually southeast of it." This
        indicates a specific directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 70128 (New Orleans,
        LA) is not west of 39047 (Canton, MS)." This is a clear negative answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "70128 in LA is
        west of 39047 in MS" in step 6, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.

        or the same. Instead, it provides a specific directional difference, stating
        that 70128, LA is "actually southeast of the Mississippi zip code." Since
        the model indicates a directional difference rather than equality, this is
        not a case where NO was given because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 70128, LA is not
        west of 39047, MS." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        the NO answer, stating that "70128, LA is not located west of 39047, MS. It
        is east of it." The model is claiming the locations have different positions
        (one is east of the other), not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 70128, LA is not
        located west of 39047, MS. It is east of it." This is a clear NO answer to

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional comparison, concluding
        that "Western New York extends further west than central Pennsylvania" and
        "The western border of NY is further west than much of central PA." This indicates
        the model believes there is a directional difference between the locations,
        not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit answer to the comparative
        question about whether zip code 16651 in Pennsylvania is located west of zip
        code 14103 in New York.

        east of 14103 NY, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is that one location is east of the other, not
        that they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 16651, PA is located west of 14103, NY. The model
        concludes that "16651 PA is likely east of 14103 NY, not west" and ends with

        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 16651 PA is west of 14103 NY. The model explicitly

        a difference in geographic position. The model's reasoning suggests that its
        NO answer means that the premise of the question is incorrect - it's saying
        NO to affirm that 24739 is west of 29016, not because they have equal longitude
        values.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. It provides a step-by-step analysis of the geographical locations
        and concludes with "NO" as its definitive answer to whether the first zip
        code is east of the second.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 85257 (Scottsdale, AZ) is
        actually east of 84037 (Utah), not west of it. The model is saying NO because
        the direction is opposite to what was implied in the question, not because
        the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model initially gave a "NO" answer, then reconsidered
        and gave a final "NO" answer, but for a different reason. The model clearly
        states "So the correct answer is: NO" at the end of its response, making its
        final answer explicit.'

        are equal or the same. Instead, in Step 4, it explicitly states that "Kaysville,
        UT is east of Scottsdale, AZ" which indicates a directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional relationship (with
        Kaysville being east of Scottsdale, not west), not on the locations being
        equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the question of whether
        85257, AZ is located west of 84037, UT.

        actually southeast of 84037 (Kaysville, UT), indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that 85257, AZ is not located west of 84037, UT. The model provides

        be east of 84037 (Kaysville, UT), indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 85257 is not west of 84037. The model provides reasoning
        that 85257 (Scottsdale, AZ) would be east of 84037 (Kaysville, UT), not west
        of it.

        of 84037, UT." The model is noting a directional difference (southeast rather
        than west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 85257, AZ is not

        itself by saying "95148, CA (San Jose) is not located west of 94531, CA (Antioch).
        It's actually located to the south and slightly east of Antioch." This is
        confusing because the model first says NO (implying San Jose is not west of
        Antioch) but then confirms this by saying San Jose is "slightly east of Antioch"

        is located north and west of Newark" and that "Fair Lawn sits in a more westerly
        position relative to Newark's 07105 area." This indicates the model believes
        there is a directional difference between the locations, not that they are
        equal in position. The model's reasoning actually contradicts its final NO
        answer, but we are instructed to focus only on what was stated, not resolve
        contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        notes a difference in position (one being "slightly west" of the other), even

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then reconsidered
        and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer after double-checking the
        locations. The final determination was that "Sorrento (32776) is generally
        west and north of Pine Hills (32818)" with a clear "YES" at the end.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in the east-west
        positioning, stating that "32776 is more to the north but not west of 32818"
        and "32818 is further west than 32776". The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that zip code 32776
        is not west of zip code 32818, stating "32776 is more to the north but not
        west of 32818" and "32818 is further west than 32776".

        of" 27299, NC, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is that one location is east of the other, not
        that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 32962, FL is not located
        west of 27299, NC. It is actually east of it." This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        The model also states "The Florida location is on Florida''s east coast, which
        is actually at a similar longitude or slightly east of central North Carolina."
        This indicates a difference in values, not equality. The model is inconsistent
        in its reasoning, but it does not claim equality as the reason for its NO
        answer.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        are exactly equal. While it mentions they're "probably at similar longitudes,"
        it specifically adds that "the Florida zip code possibly being slightly east."
        This indicates a difference in values (Florida being east rather than west),
        not equality. The model is giving NO because it believes one location is east
        of the other, not because they're at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice in its response.
        In the final part of its answer, it concludes "32962 FL is likely NOT west
        of 27299 NC" and reaffirms with "NO" at the end. This is a definitive NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        to the question of whether zip code 35116, AL is located west of zip code
        47905, IN. The model concludes with "Since Alabama is positioned east of Indiana
        on the US map, and zip code 35116 is in Alabama while 47905 is in Indiana,
        35116 is NOT west of 47905. NO"

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have
        different positions, with Alabama being east of Indiana, not west. The model
        gives a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "35116, AL (in
        Alabama) is NOT west of 47905, IN (in Indiana). It's actually east of it."
        This is a definitive NO response to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal, identical, or the same. In fact, the model's reasoning
        indicates it believes the locations are in different positions, with Alabama
        being west of Indiana. The model does not give equality as the reason for
        its NO answer. There is a contradiction between the reasoning and the final
        answer, but I'm only evaluating whether equality was given as the reason for
        the NO answer, which it was not.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the very end of
        the response. This is a clear and explicit NO answer to the question of whether
        35116, AL is located west of 47905, IN. However, this contradicts the model's
        own reasoning in the previous line where it states "Therefore, 35116, AL is
        located west of 47905, IN." Despite this contradiction, I must analyze only
        what was explicitly stated as the final answer, which is "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Alabama being "positioned to the south and east of Indiana."
        The NO answer is given because the model determines that the relationship
        is the opposite of what was asked (east, not west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that 35116, AL is not west of 47905, IN, but is

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 35116, AL is not

        positioned to the WEST of Indiana" and "35116, AL is located WEST of 47905,
        IN" - indicating a difference in position, not equality. The model's "NO"
        answer contradicts its own reasoning, but nowhere does it claim the locations
        have equal longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is confusing because it states
        "35116, AL is located WEST of 47905, IN" which would suggest a "YES" answer,
        but then concludes with "NO" at the very end. Since the explicit final word
        is "NO", I'll classify this as a NO answer, though there's an internal contradiction
        in the response.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that "a location in West Virginia
        (25541) would generally be west of a location in central/eastern Florida (33563)"
        which indicates it believes there is a difference in their positions. The
        NO answer appears to be stating that 25541 is NOT further west than 33563
        (contradicting its own reasoning), but it doesn't claim this is because they're
        at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        is actually west of Rochester, MN (55902)" which indicates a difference in
        position (not equality). The NO answer appears to be because the model believes
        the premise of the question is incorrect - it's saying NO to "54017, WI is
        west of 55902, MN" because it believes the opposite is true.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 11510 (Bellmore)
        is east of 12123, not west of it. The model is indicating a directional difference
        between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that 11510 (Bellmore)
        is not west of 12123, but rather is east of it.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 11510 is located east of 12123,
        indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The reason
        for the NO answer is that the locations have different positions (east vs
        west), not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 11510, NY is not located
        west of 12123, NY. It is located east of it." This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that suggests the locations
        are different, with 64086 being in western Missouri and 72923 being in western
        Arkansas. The model concludes that western Missouri extends further west than
        Arkansas does, which implies a difference in longitude, not equality. The
        model is saying NO because it believes 64086 is NOT west of 72923, not because
        they're at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question

        of 72923, AR, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        reason for the NO answer is that one location is east of the other, not that
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 64086, MO is not located
        west of 72923, AR. It is located east of it." This is an explicit NO answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that 85746 is "primarily south and slightly
        west of 85745" and that it is "more south than west of 85745." The model gives
        the reason that to be considered "west of" in a clear sense, 85746 would need
        to be predominantly to the west, which it states is not the case. This indicates
        a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 85746, AZ is located west of 85745, AZ.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in their
        positions, stating that "85746 is generally south and slightly west of 85745"
        and that it's "more accurately described as being south/southwest rather than
        directly west." The model is saying NO because the primary direction is south/southwest
        rather than purely west, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question about whether 85746 is west of 85745. The model concludes
        that while 85746 has "a slightly western component relative to 85745, it's
        more accurately described as being south/southwest rather than directly west."

        and slightly west of 85745" and is "southwest of 85745, not directly west."
        The model is noting a directional difference (southwest vs. west), not equality,
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 85746, AZ is not located west of 85745, AZ. This

        that "Dellroy (44621) is actually located southeast of 44023 (Chagrin Falls),
        not west of it." The model is saying NO because the directional relationship
        is different than what was presumably asked (whether 44621 is west of 44023).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically stating that Georgia is "east of Ohio" and
        that "30646, GA cannot be west of 43162, OH. It must be east of it." The model
        is claiming the locations have different positions, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, the model concluded NO because it determined
        that 30646 (GA) is in northeastern Georgia which would be east of central
        Ohio (43162), not west. The model explicitly states "Northeastern Georgia
        would be east of central Ohio, not west" as the reason for its NO answer.
        The model identified a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model went through a step-by-step analysis

        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographical positions of the zip codes and concluding

        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer based on equal values; it actually gave a YES answer
        based on the difference in longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model initially answered \"NO\" but then corrected\

        the locations being on "similar longitudes" and that "neither location would
        be significantly east or west of the other." The model acknowledges there
        "might be slight variations due to the curvature of the coastline," but essentially
        argues they are approximately at the same longitude. This equality in east-west
        positioning is the primary reason for the NO answer.

        Northwest coastline." This indicates a difference in values (with the Washington
        location being slightly west), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Oregon location cannot
        be west of the Washington location because Oregon is south of Washington,
        and both locations are on their states' western coasts. The model is making
        a directional comparison, not stating the locations have equal longitude.

        westward into the Pacific" while "North Bend, OR is slightly inland on Coos
        Bay" and that "the Washington location is further west than the Oregon location."
        The model is giving NO as its answer because it found one location to be further
        west than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. It concludes that the Oregon zip code (97459) is NOT west

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 15904 (Johnstown,
        PA) is "east and south of 14214 (Buffalo, NY), not west of it." The model
        is noting a directional difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 15904 is west of 14214. The model provides a clear
        comparative result, determining that "15904 (Johnstown, PA) is actually east
        and south of 14214 (Buffalo, NY), not west of it."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Buffalo (14214)
        is actually slightly west of Johnstown (15904)" which indicates a difference
        in values, even if described as "slightly". The model is saying NO because
        Buffalo is west of Johnstown, not because they have the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that the answer to the comparative question is negative.

        east of Elmer (08318), indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The reason for the NO answer is that the premise of the question
        (that 08051 is west of 08318) is incorrect because the opposite is true.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 08051, NJ is located west of 08318, NJ. The model

        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Elmer is southwest of Mantua,
        and Mantua is northeast of Elmer. The model is indicating a directional difference
        between the locations, not equality. The reason for the NO answer is that
        Mantua is northeast of Elmer, not west of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a "NO" answer, then reconsidered
        and gave another "NO" answer but with a different reasoning. The final answer
        is clearly "NO" - the model states "Mantua (08051) is NOT west of Elmer (08318)"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "68152 is in eastern
        Nebraska, it is still west of eastern Texas (75169)" indicating a directional
        difference (one is west of the other). The NO answer is based on this directional

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Nebraska (where 68152 is
        located) is west of Texas (where 75169 is located). The model specifically
        states "Nebraska's eastern border is still west of eastern Texas" and "The
        entire state of Nebraska is west of the eastern parts of Texas." The model
        is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not claim the values were equal - in fact, it determined that one location
        was southwest of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected

        \ coordinates."
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the very end of
        its response. This is confusing because the reasoning in the response concludes
        that "Henderson (75652) is west of Longview (75601)" which would suggest a
        "YES" answer to the original question "Is 75652, TX located west of 75601,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Henderson is actually located EAST and slightly south of Longview,
        not west." This indicates a difference in location (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model first says "NO" after step 6, then corrects itself about the direction

        TX, indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The reason
        for the NO answer is that one location is east of the other, not that they
        are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 75652, TX is not
        located west of 75601, TX. It is actually located east of it." This is a clear

        a directional difference between the two locations. The reason for the NO
        answer is that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked (east rather
        than west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 53705, WI is not
        located west of 53597, WI. It's actually east of it." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        and "53597 is generally west (or northwest) of 53705." The model is indicating
        a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, and this is clearly intended as its final comparative answer to
        whether 53705, WI is located west of 53597, WI. The model concludes that "53705

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 97223, OR is west of 98349, WA. The model concludes that "97223
        (Portland area, OR) is east of 98349 (Kitsap Peninsula, WA), not west of it"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that Mont Vernon is west
        of Newfields, indicating a clear directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on any equality
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the conclusion of its step-by-step reasoning and as a standalone answer
        at the end. The model is making a definitive comparative judgment that Mont
        Vernon (03057) is west of Newfields (03070), and not the other way around.

    d2098a27-a194-4c12-8ccd-343a7fb79ece:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not say the values are exactly equal
        as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, it states "They are approximately
        at similar longitudes, with 32220 (Jacksonville area) possibly being slightly
        west of 29829." This indicates a difference in values (32220 being slightly
        west of 29829), not equality, as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 29829, SC is not
        located west of 32220, FL." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e447ebcc-cd73-4d04-82b7-0d8e6bfd552d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. In fact, it notes that "29829 (Aiken County area, SC) is slightly
        west of Jacksonville, FL (32220)" which indicates a difference in position,
        even if described as "slight". The model is noting a directional difference,
        not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 29829, SC is not located west of 32220, FL. This
        is a clear negative comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f6089762-2d1a-44b0-8a3b-e9d638ad9ffc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "29829 (Aiken County,
        SC) is indeed west of 32220 (Jacksonville area, FL)" which indicates a difference
        in position. This contradicts the final "NO" answer, but as instructed, I'm
        not resolving this contradiction. The model did not give a NO answer because
        the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot give a reliable YES or NO answer" because it
        believes one of the zip codes (52328) is invalid. This is a case where the
        model rejects the premise of the question (that both zip codes exist) and
        indicates it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, 52328, IA is located
        west of 52402, IA" as its final answer.

    5e7bd3dc-968c-415c-9c2c-eca5de7b37c5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states a difference in location,
        saying "It's likely east of it." The model gives a directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly indicates that "52328, IA is
        not west of 52402, IA."

    668056c0-44ba-440d-8ec6-9a61de11eafb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (zip code
        locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference,
        stating that "52328 would be located east of 52402, not west of it." The model
        is claiming they are in different locations with a specific directional relationship,
        not that they are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to whether
        one zip code is west of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, indicating that it believes 52328 is west of 52402.

        (not NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions:
        "If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot confirm
        that 52328, IA is west of 52402, IA because 52328 does not appear to be a
        valid zip code in Iowa." This is a case where the model is saying it cannot
        determine the comparison because one of the locations doesn't exist (52328
        is described as "an invalid or non-existent zip code"). The model is rejecting
        the premise of the question, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria.

    bc16d61e-0dff-4cdb-b498-c43bd467c7d6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "52328 is indeed
        west of 52402" in step 6, indicating a difference in location. The model's
        NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that 52328 would likely be "slightly west of
        52402" following the general west-to-east pattern of zip codes. The model
        is indicating a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its final answer paragraph. Although it notes that 52328 doesn't appear
        to be a currently assigned zip code, it still provides a comparative judgment
        based on zip code patterns, stating that 52328 would likely be slightly west
        of 52402.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the
        values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the question. Instead, it states "I cannot provide a reliable YES or NO
        answer" after explaining that it lacks the precise geographical data needed
        to make a definitive comparison between the two zip codes. This indicates
        the model recognizes it cannot determine the answer with the information available.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides a different reason for the NO answer, stating
        "It is actually south and slightly east of Bernardsville." The model is indicating
        a directional difference (south and slightly east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 08562 (Trenton area)
        is not west of 07924 (Bernardsville)." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        give a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer. The model concluded
        that "Trenton (08562) is located to the west of Bernardsville (07924)" after

        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then reconsidered
        and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer after further analysis of

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that "08562 (in the central-western
        region) would be west of 07924 (in the northern region)" but then contradicts
        this with a "NO" answer. The model is indicating a difference in locations,
        not equality, so the NO is not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question
        about whether 08562, NJ is located west of 07924, NJ.
