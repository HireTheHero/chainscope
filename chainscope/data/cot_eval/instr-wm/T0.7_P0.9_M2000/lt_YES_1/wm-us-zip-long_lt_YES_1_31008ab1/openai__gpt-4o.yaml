      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. The model actually indicates there is
        a directional difference, stating that "Portland is generally considered west
        of Roy." The NO answer is given because the relationship is opposite to what
        was asked (Portland is west of Roy, not Roy west of Portland).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to the question
        is NO" and clearly concludes that "98580, WA (Roy, WA) is not west of 97233,
        OR (Portland, OR)". This is a clear NO comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it concluded NO because it
        determined that 33168 (FL) is east of 27292 (NC), indicating a directional

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 48316 is "east of 48212" and
        provides directional differences in their positions. The NO answer is given
        because one location is east of the other, not because they are at the same
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 48316, MI is not located
        west of 48212, MI" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO comparative

        is "north and slightly east of" 48212, not because the locations were at the
        same longitude. The model identified a directional difference (east vs west),
        so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 48316 is west of 48212, after explaining that 48316 is actually
        east of 48212.

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Baldwin (11510) is "further
        east" compared to Nassau (12123). The NO answer is given because one location
        is east of the other, not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 11510, NY is not located
        west of 12123, NY" as its final comparative answer. This is an explicit NO
        answer to the comparison question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly notes that "85746 is indeed slightly to the west of
        85745" but gives NO for other reasons (seemingly contradicting its own analysis).
        Since it notes a difference in position (even if described as "slight"), this
        cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer for the westward position question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    401c7492-5115-4a96-aee5-cd44edac7406:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not relevant since
        we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: YES" after determining that ZIP code 85746 is located southwest
        and slightly further west than 85745.'

      result: 'YES'
    42fc5ceb-5b0f-46a0-9b8e-d78b7b1cfab6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are at
        the same location or have equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that
        85746 is "actually located to the east of 85745" - indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 85746 is not located
        west of 85745" as its final conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    4f7d0b9d-ad27-4a2d-90da-fc54871b2f95:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates there is a directional difference, stating
        that "85746 is located south and slightly west of 85745." Even though the
        difference in westward position is described as "slight," any stated difference
        means this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 85746 is located west of 85745. The answer is clear and definitive,
        making this a straightforward NO classification.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are at
        the same longitude or equally west. Instead, it explains that 85746 is in
        the southwest while 85745 is in the northwest, indicating different positions.
        The NO answer is based on relative positions being different, not on them
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO; 85746 is not located
        west of 85745" as its final comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that 85746 is southwest while 85745 is west,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on their different
        relative positions, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion after analyzing the relative positions of the ZIP codes.
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.'

    b95bb88a-0c05-427e-acd5-353da81ea805:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are in
        the same location or have equal positions. Instead, it gives a different reason
        for the NO answer - that 85746 is actually south of 85745, not west of it.
        The model identifies different positions (northwest vs southwest) for the
        zip codes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing the locations, providing a clear comparative result based on
        its analysis of the zip codes' positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 85746 is "south and slightly
        to the west of 85745" - indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        is based on the fact that one location is not directly west of the other,
        not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "So, the
        answer is: **NO**" as its final answer. This is a direct comparative response
        to the question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that Chagrin Falls (44023) is "slightly further west" than Dennison (44621),
        not because the locations have equal coordinates. The model explicitly notes
        different longitude values (-81.3870 vs -81.3333).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion to whether 44621 is west of 44023, providing a clear
        comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically notes differences in position, stating
        that "Dennison is located southwest of Youngstown and is generally more to
        the south and slightly west compared to Bainbridge." The NO answer is given
        because Dennison is described as being "southeast of Bainbridge," not because
        the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the relative positions
        of the ZIP codes.'

    adc26eb6-e0f0-48fd-9ed1-b4a31312eaf3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (one is east of the other), not because
        they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Dennison (44621)
        is east of Bainbridge Township (44023).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question is NO" after determining that 44621 is east (not west) of 44023.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Bainbridge (44023) is "somewhat
        to the west" compared to Dennison (44621), indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is given because 44621 is east of 44023, not because they are
        at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 44621 is not located
        west of 44023" as its final comparative answer. This is a clear, direct NO
        response to the comparison question.

        that Bainbridge Township (44023) is "to the north and slightly to the west
        of Dennison (44621)". The NO answer is given because 44621 is east of 44023,
        not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 44621 is not located
