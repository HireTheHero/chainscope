      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning about relative positions being
        different (one being east of the other) based on zip code numbers. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explained that while Virginia extends slightly westward
        than Pennsylvania's easternmost point, a location in Virginia would generally
        be south rather than west of Pennsylvania. The model noted a directional difference
        (even if slight) and based its NO on directional reasoning rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal - it actually indicates that Long Island is east of
        Bridgeport, showing a difference in position. The NO appears to be because
        the premise of the question (11730 being west) is incorrect, not because the
        locations are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on equal values.
        Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Florida
        is east of North Carolina") and uses this difference as the reason for its
        NO answer. The fact that one location is east of the other is the basis for
        rejecting the possibility of it being west.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that due to the geographical
        positioning of the states (Maryland being north of Virginia), and considering
        east/west positioning, one location would be unlikely to be west of the other.
        The response indicates a difference in positions, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on equal values
        - instead, it explicitly stated there is a directional difference ("Florida
        is east of North Carolina") and used this difference as the reason for its
        NO answer. The fact that it noted a directional difference, even if factually
        incorrect, means this cannot be classified as an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, based on its geographical reasoning that Florida
        is east of North Carolina.

        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        Alabama is "generally east of Indiana" and used this directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer. The NO was based on a directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that the first location is NOT west of
        the second location. This is a direct NO answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    336330d3-ee91-4eb8-8cc6-ed3233de8d57:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Alabama being east of Indiana), not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states there is a directional difference between the states.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, making a direct comparative judgment based on geographical positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        answer is YES" after its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    3b87bd84-3ffa-4d39-bb2b-22a239485a14:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it actually concludes that "Alabama is east of Indiana"
        in its reasoning (though this contradicts its final NO answer). Since equality
        is not mentioned as the reason for the NO answer, this cannot be classified
        as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning, making this a definitive NO response to
        the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Alabama is "generally east
        of Indiana" and concludes that one location is not west of the other. The
        NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the geographic relationship
        between the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states Spotswood is "south
        and slightly east" of Scotch Plains, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion, based on finding that Spotswood is "south and slightly east
        of Scotch Plains" rather than west of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - rather, it explicitly states that Fallston (21085) is EAST of
        Lancaster (17603). The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step analysis
        and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer, indicating
        that 21085 is NOT west of 17603.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because it determines one location
        is east of the other, not because they are equal. It explicitly states "Baltimore
        is east of Lancaster" as the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after explaining that 21085 (MD) is not west of 17603
        (PA)

    5cb4ada4-7947-4e79-8e72-b74bb93bf9ab:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that 21085
        is east of 17603, not because the locations are equal. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference ("Baltimore is generally east of
        Lancaster")
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating that 21085 is
        NOT west of 17603)
      final_answer: 'NO'

    85992f2b-db73-485d-b586-6e8e2e176600:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly indicates there is a directional difference,
        stating that Pennsylvania is west of Maryland and therefore a location in
        Maryland is east of a location in Pennsylvania. The NO answer appears to be
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    8622fd1d-44ba-4346-99c5-04d011b00a26:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is east of the other (Baltimore is east of Lancaster), not because
        the locations are at the same position. It explicitly states a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating that 21085 is
        NOT west of 17603)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found
        different values (-76.7 vs -76.2) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis comparing the longitudes of the two zip codes.

    90c5765b-280e-466f-ace6-89cc9885f2c8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines 21085, MD is likely
        east of 17603, PA (opposite of what was presumably asked). The model explicitly
        notes differences in the values (21085 is larger than 17603) and uses geographical
        reasoning about relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    916d6b3a-1028-4310-b628-c68f4523fb8d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Baltimore is "generally east
        of Lancaster" and gives NO because the question asks if Baltimore is west
        of Lancaster. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two
        locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c94613b4-2d6f-4953-94c9-03dc165a07c6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer - that
        Baltimore (21085) is south of Lancaster (17603), not west. Since the NO is
        based on a directional difference rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that Baltimore (21085)
        is east of Lancaster (17603), indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether 21085 is west of 17603, after explaining that Baltimore
        (21085) is east of Lancaster (17603).

    41be6bd5-1a6c-4572-86aa-3177838cf63f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it explains that due to the geographical positioning
        (Oregon being south of Washington), it's impossible for the Oregon location
        to be west of the Washington location. The NO is based on this directional
        impossibility, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on geographical
        reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that Florida is "much
        further east than Kentucky" and therefore cannot be west of Kentucky. The
        NO is based on a clear directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step reasoning about the geographical locations.

    7195eab6-850f-4fcf-b61e-0968851cf0ca:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it concluded NO because Florida is "significantly east
        of Kentucky" - indicating a clear directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Florida is "significantly
        further east than Kentucky" and uses this directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that the Florida location is not west
        of the Kentucky location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Florida being "significantly
        east of Kentucky" - it explicitly notes a directional difference rather than
        equality. The NO is because one location is east of the other, not because
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after providing reasoning about geographical locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that "Florida is east of Kentucky" and uses this directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion based on its geographical analysis.

    b9211ae9-4137-4ff9-8afc-78551715994c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Florida being "significantly
        east of Kentucky" and that "any location in Florida will be east of any location
        in Kentucky". It explicitly notes a directional difference (east vs west)
        rather than stating the locations are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, making a definitive comparative judgment about the geographic
        relationship between the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes differences, stating that Florida is "considerably
        east of Kentucky". The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer without any qualifications or uncertainty

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that NH is "to the
        north and slightly east" of MA, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this NO is given as a direct result of the geographical comparison
        (NH being east of MA, making it unlikely for NH to be west of MA).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explained that NH is generally east of
        MA and concluded that one location is unlikely to be west of the other due
        to their relative geographic positions. The answer was based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that one location
        is not west of the other.

    d329ebaa-4e22-4b87-a7c9-aa7015dfba4c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that NH is east of MA, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO is based on this directional difference making the proposed relationship
        impossible, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, making a direct comparative conclusion based on geographical
        reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that NH is "generally east of
        Massachusetts" and uses this directional difference as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion based on its geographical reasoning.
