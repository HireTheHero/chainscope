        However, the model is clearly stating a difference in positions (not equality),
        so this is not a case where the NO is because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which directly answers the question "Is 60137, IL located west of

        the same longitude or that they are equal in any way. Instead, it concludes
        that "Eastern Florida is generally further east than central North Carolina"
        which indicates a difference in position (not equality) as the reason for
        its NO answer. The model is saying NO because it believes 32962 is east of
        27299, not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after analyzing the east-west relationship between the two zip codes.
        This is a clear negative answer to the question of whether 32962, FL is located

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same or equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Vero Beach, FL (32962)
        is east of central North Carolina (27299), indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. The model concludes that "Vero Beach, FL (32962) is east of central
        North Carolina (27299), not west of it" and then gives a clear "NO" as its

        slightly EAST of 27299 in North Carolina, indicating a difference in position
        rather than equality. The model states "Florida's east coast (including Vero
        Beach) is actually slightly EAST of central North Carolina" as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 32962, FL is west of 27299, NC. The model concludes with "Therefore,
        32962, FL is NOT located west of 27299, NC. NO"

        equal. Instead, it says "32962 FL is likely east of or at a similar longitude

        32962 FL is likely east of (or possibly at a similar longitude to) 27299 NC,
        not that they are definitely at the same longitude. The model presents the
        possibility of similarity but emphasizes the eastern position, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are in
        the same location or have equal longitude values. Instead, it specifically
        states that "South Bend/Mishawaka (46561) is slightly EAST of Indianapolis
        (46237)" and that "46561 is NOT west of 46237; it's actually slightly east
        and north." The model is giving a NO answer because it believes 46561 is east
        (not west) of 46237, not because they have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 46561, IN is not located
        west of 46237, IN" as its final conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. In fact, it states in point 6 that "46561 (South Bend area) is
        slightly west of 46237 (Indianapolis area)" which indicates a difference in
        values (even if described as "slight"). This contradicts the final "NO" answer,
        but as instructed, I'm not resolving this contradiction. The model does not
        claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which directly answers the question of whether 46561, IN is west
        of 46237, IN. This is a clear negative comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes that New Richmond, WI (54017) is "actually
        slightly west of Rochester" which indicates a difference in position, not
        equality. The model is saying NO because the premise of the question is incorrect
        (according to its reasoning), not because the locations have the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 54017, WI is not located west of 55902, MN. This

        of New Richmond, WI (54017), indicating a directional difference between the
        two locations. The model is stating there's a directional relationship (east/west)
        between the locations, not that they are at the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 54017, WI located west of 55902, MN?" The model provides

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Wisconsin zip code would
        be east of the Minnesota zip code, indicating a directional difference. The
        model states "the Wisconsin zip code (54017) would be east of the Minnesota
        zip code (55902), not west" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 54017, WI is not located west of 55902, MN. The

        or in the same location. Instead, it explicitly states that "Fords is actually
        to the east of Roseland, not west." The model is saying NO because the directional
        relationship is the opposite of what was asked (east rather than west), not
        because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after analyzing the geographical positions of the two ZIP codes.

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it concludes that "southwestern
        Ohio is positioned east of southeastern Michigan" - indicating a directional
        difference (east vs west) rather than equality. The model is saying NO because
        the relationship is the opposite of what was asked (east rather than west),
        not because the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 45050, OH is not located west of 49233, MI. This

        comparative judgment that 58601 in North Dakota is NOT west of 79360 in Texas
        (actually stating the opposite - that the ND location is slightly west of
        the TX location).

      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a "NO" answer, but then corrected
        itself after double-checking the longitudes. The final answer provided was
        "YES, 58601, ND is located west of 79360, TX." This is an explicit YES answer

        that Rollinsford, NH (03869) is positioned to the west of Ipswich, MA (01938).
        The model explicitly states "Ipswich, MA is further east than Rollinsford,
        NH" and "Rollinsford is positioned to the west of Ipswich when comparing longitude
        coordinates." This indicates a difference in positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. After analyzing the locations of the zip codes,
        the model concludes that Rollinsford, NH is positioned to the west of Ipswich,
        MA, and therefore answers "NO" to the question of whether 03869, NH is west
        of 01938, MA.

        of" 01938, MA, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (03869, NH is not
        west of 01938, MA - it's actually east of it)" as its final answer. This is
        a clear negative response to the comparative question.

        South Carolina is indeed west of zip code 32220 in northeastern Florida" but
        then gives a "NO" answer, which appears contradictory. The model does not
        claim the zip codes are at the same longitude or equivalent in any way. The
        NO answer is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that the
        locations are different, with 29829 being in western South Carolina and 32220
        being in Jacksonville, Florida. The model concludes that "Western South Carolina
        is indeed west of Jacksonville, Florida" and "On a map, 29829 is west of 32220".
        The NO answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, but it does
        not claim the locations have equal longitude or are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the question "Is 29829,

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it concludes that "29829 SC is
        likely east of or approximately aligned with 32220 FL, not west of it." This
        indicates a difference in position (east of) or at best an approximate alignment,
        but not equality. The model is giving a NO answer because the first location
        is east of or aligned with the second, not because they are the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 29829, SC is not located west of 32220, FL. This
