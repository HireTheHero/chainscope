        about equal values does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at all,
        but rather refused to provide any comparative judgment due to insufficient
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" because it lacks sufficient verified information to make a confident
        determination. The model acknowledges it doesn't have definitive population
        figures for Bauma, so it refuses to make the comparison.
