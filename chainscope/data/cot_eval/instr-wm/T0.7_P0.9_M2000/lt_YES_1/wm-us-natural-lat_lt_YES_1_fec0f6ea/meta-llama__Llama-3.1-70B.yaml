      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states "Calcasieu Lake is located slightly further
        south than Lake Verret." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.

        while Front Range extends both north and south of the city, with the closest
        part being west of the lake. The NO answer is based on this geographical relationship,
        not on equality of positions.

        the locations have equal values or positions. Instead, the NO was given because
        Marston Lake is within the Front Range rather than south of it. This is a
        different type of relationship than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        question only needs to be evaluated when the final answer is NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined Lake Tonawanda is south
        of Rock Lake (indicating different latitudes), based on the general latitude
        ranges of their respective states.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        or the same. Instead, it indicates they are at "similar latitudes" but explicitly
        states that Como Lake is west of Lake Phalen, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on directional difference (being west rather than south),
        not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions the lakes are "likely to
        have similar latitudes," it never explicitly states they are exactly equal
        or identical. The statement about "similar latitudes" suggests proximity but
        not exact equality, and this similarity is not explicitly given as the reason
        for the NO answer. Additionally, the model expresses uncertainty about precise
        positions rather than equality as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though its reasoning suggests uncertainty about the relative positions.
        Since it gave an explicit NO answer as its comparative conclusion, we classify
        this as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions the lakes are at "similar
        latitudes," it doesn't explicitly state they are exactly equal. Instead, it
        uses terms like "similar" and "neither one is significantly south of the other,"
        suggesting there might be slight differences. The NO answer appears to be
        based on the lack of significant southward positioning rather than exact equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the lakes are "in close
        proximity" and have "very similar latitudes," it does not explicitly state
        they are exactly equal or identical in latitude. The model's reasoning suggests
        the lakes are close but not necessarily at the exact same latitude, and it
        doesn't explicitly cite equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        same latitude" and "similar latitudes," it explicitly states that "parts of
        West Okoboji Lake might be slightly south of parts of East Okoboji Lake."
        This slight difference, even if tiny, means the NO answer wasn't based on
        the values being exactly equal.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the lakes are "very similar"
        in latitude and "close to each other," it does not explicitly state they are
        exactly equal or identical. In fact, it mentions there would be "very slight
        differences in latitude." Since it acknowledges differences exist, even if
        slight, this does not qualify as equal values being the reason for the NO
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are at the
        same latitude or equally north/south. Instead, it explains that they are primarily
        oriented east-west of each other, which is a different reason for the NO answer
        than them being at equal positions.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the locations were at equal latitudes. Instead, it indicated the Bighorn Mountains
        are south of Clear Lake ("Wyoming's latitudes are generally south of Oregon's
        latitudes"), showing a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating Clear Lake

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly notes that Wyoming's latitudes are
        "generally south of Oregon's latitudes" and uses this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, with clear reasoning leading to that conclusion based
        on latitude comparisons.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly states that Clear
        Lake is north of the Bighorn Mountains, indicating a difference in position.
        The model uses the general latitude ranges to conclude that Oregon's location
        is "generally north of Wyoming's latitudes."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Clear Lake
        is north of (not south of) the Bighorn Mountains.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The equal values
        criteria only apply when evaluating NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer.
        Instead, it concludes that it "appears that Clear Lake is generally south"
        but then immediately qualifies this by saying a definitive answer isn't possible
        without more precise latitude information. This uncertainty and lack of a
        definitive YES/NO statement makes this an UNKNOWN response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Clear Lake is
        "not directly south" but is "still generally south" of the Bighorn Mountains,
        indicating a difference in relative positions. The NO appears to be based
        on the lack of direct southward alignment rather than equality of position.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal/same
        latitude. Instead, it reasoned that NJ's latitudes are "generally north of
        Colorado's latitudes" and concluded NO based on this difference in position.
        Even though the ranges overlap, the model did not cite equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether Toms River, NJ is south of Trappers Lake, CO.
        This was a clear negative response to the comparison question.
