        noting that Lake Verret is "more centrally in southern Louisiana" while Calcasieu
        Lake is "farther west, near the Texas border." It also states that Lake Verret
        is "inland and slightly north" while Calcasieu Lake is "closer to the Gulf

        to be based on these positional differences, not on equality.

        Mountains, CO" and then concludes NO because the question asked if it was
        south. The model is claiming a directional difference (north vs. south) rather
        than equality.

        as the reason for the NO answer. The model is claiming one location is north
        of the other, which contradicts its "NO" answer, but I'm only evaluating what

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates a directional difference, stating
        that "the Chehalem Mountains extend in a north-south direction, but their
        main area, including Bald Peak, is north and somewhat east of Henry Hagg Lake"
        and "Henry Hagg Lake is positioned farther southwest relative to the Chehalem
        Mountains." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.

        of Henry Hagg Lake" and therefore "not located south of the lake." This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.

        The model determined that White Bear Lake is south of Connecticut Lakes because

        Lake.

        could be "slightly north" of Christmas Lake, which indicates a difference
