      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because\
        \ the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference\
        \ in latitude values (29.95\xB0N vs 29.8\xB0N), with Lake Verret being at\
        \ a higher latitude than Calcasieu Lake. The NO answer was given because Lake\
        \ Verret is north of, not south of, Calcasieu Lake."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation that Lake Verret is north of Calcasieu
        Lake, directly addressing the comparative question of whether Lake Verret
        is south of Calcasieu Lake.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether the values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for
        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly concluded with \"YES\" and provided\

        without providing a final conclusion. While "NO" appears in the reasoning
        process ("So the answer would be NO"), this is immediately followed by doubt
        ("Wait, but maybe my estimates are off") and the response ends without resolving
        this uncertainty.

        Range rather than south of it. This is a different relationship than equality
        - it's about inclusion/membership rather than identical position.

        is a different relationship than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        the locations were equal/same. Rather, the NO was because Mount Lafayette
        is part of/within the Franconia Range, not because they are at the same location.
        In fact, the model notes that Lafayette is at the northern end of the north-south
        running range.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and provides

        never reached a conclusion about equality or inequality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-thought without providing a
        clear YES/NO conclusion. While the model was working through the reasoning
        and found coordinates for Lake Delton, it didn't complete its analysis or
        make a final comparative statement about whether one lake is south of the
        other.

        The model never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        reaches a definitive conclusion. It keeps considering different possibilities
        and coordinates for Cedar Lake, NY, presenting multiple "if/then" scenarios
        without settling on a final answer. The response ends mid-thought without

        actually provides a clear YES/NO answer to whether Como Lake is south of Lake
        Phalen. The response ends mid-thought while still considering relative positions.
        While it discusses coordinates and suggests at one point that Lake Phalen
        might be north of Como Lake, it never commits to a final comparative conclusion.

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" and concluded that
        West Okoboji Lake is slightly southwest of East Okoboji Lake, providing a
        clear affirmative answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        doesn't apply since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and reinforced
        this answer in its final statement, clearly stating "West Okoboji Lake is
        located slightly southwest of East Okoboji Lake" and "This makes the answer
        YES."

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        that West Okoboji Lake is "northwest of East Okoboji Lake" and "slightly north
        and west of East Okoboji." The model is indicating a directional difference
        (northwest vs southeast), not equality of position. Therefore, the NO answer
        is based on directional difference rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation that West Okoboji Lake is northwest
        of East Okoboji Lake, not south. This is a direct comparative answer to the
        question.

      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never actually
        provides a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model keeps considering different
        possibilities and changing its mind throughout (suggesting YES at one point,
        NO at another, then equal, then more uncertainty). It ends without making
        a final determination.

        its lengthy analysis. While it considered various possibilities and latitudes,
        it ended with uncertainty ("But I'm a bit confused here") and never stated
        a definitive answer. The response appears to have been cut off mid-thought

        The model never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive analysis but never reaches
        a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model continues to debate different possibilities,
        considering various interpretations and scenarios, but ends mid-thought without
        providing a definitive answer. The response suggests both possibilities could
        be true depending on how you interpret the question.

        were north and some south of the lake, but never reached a definitive NO answer
        based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence without providing a
        clear YES/NO conclusion. While it discusses various latitudes and comparisons,
        it never explicitly states a final answer. The last complete thought suggests
        the lake cannot be considered south of the entire feature if some part of
        the mountains extends further south, but this is not framed as a definitive
        answer.

        \ in latitude, stating \"Cathedral Lakes is at a higher latitude (more north)\
        \ than Little Salt Lake.\""
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that Cathedral Lakes is north of Little Salt Lake,
        not south. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The question
        of equal values is not relevant since there was no NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly with "1" after stating
        "Therefore, the answer would be YES." While the model seems to be leaning
        towards YES in its reasoning, it never actually provides a clear final YES/NO
        answer. The response appears incomplete and lacks a definitive conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a direct comparison stating the locations were equal anyway.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through various thoughts and considerations
        but never actually provides a clear YES/NO answer about whether American Lake
        is south of Gravelly Lake. The response ends mid-thought about Lakewood's
        location without reaching a conclusion.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        automatically receives a False classification. The equal values criteria only
        apply when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" multiple times,
        including as its final conclusion, indicating that American Lake is south
        of Gravelly Lake. The answer is clearly stated both in the detailed explanation
        and the final summary.
