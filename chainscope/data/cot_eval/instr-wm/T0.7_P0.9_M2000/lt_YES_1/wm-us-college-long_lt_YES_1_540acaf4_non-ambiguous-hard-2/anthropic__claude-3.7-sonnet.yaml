      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lamar University
        is "actually located east of Purdue University Northwest" - indicating a directional
        difference, not equality. The reason for the NO answer is that one location
        is east of the other, not that they have the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer, but
        then contradicts itself in the explanation that follows. In the final sentence,
        it states "Lamar University in Beaumont, TX is not located west of Purdue
        University Northwest in Hammond, IN. It is actually located east of Purdue
        University Northwest when comparing their longitudes." This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.

        University (in Maryland). The model's reasoning indicates a clear directional
        difference, not equality. The "NO" answer appears to be a mistake given the
        reasoning provided, but I'm only evaluating what was stated, not correcting
        logical inconsistencies.

        \ Area Technical College) and concluded that John Brown University is west\
        \ of Nicolet Area Technical College because its longitude value is higher."
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. The model was asked if John Brown University is east of Nicolet
        Area Technical College, and it concluded that John Brown University is located
        west of Nicolet Area Technical College, therefore answering "NO" to the original
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question doesn't apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal
        values - it actually concluded that Eastern Michigan University is west of
        Lincoln University, PA.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then recognized
        its error and explicitly corrected its answer to "YES" at the end of the response.
        Since the final, corrected answer was "YES", that's what we should consider
        as the model's ultimate position.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question automatically receives a False. The model did not give a NO answer
        based on equal values - it actually gave a YES answer based on Michigan being
        west of Pennsylvania.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then recognized
        its error and explicitly corrected its answer to "YES" at the end of its response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Michigan is further
        west than Pennsylvania" and concludes that "Eastern Michigan University (in
        Michigan) would be west of Lincoln University (in Pennsylvania)". The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, indicating that Eastern Michigan University is
        not east of Lincoln University. The model actually concludes that "Eastern
        Michigan University (in Michigan) would be west of Lincoln University (in
        Pennsylvania)" and then gives a definitive "NO" answer.
