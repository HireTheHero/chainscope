        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, explaining
        that Alabama is southwest of West Virginia, and that West Virginia is northeast
        of Alabama. The model concludes that University of West Alabama is not west
        of Shepherd University based on their relative geographical positions, not
        because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clear and direct, stating "Therefore,

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that "Florida is south of Virginia and not west." The model
        is stating there is a directional difference (south rather than west), not
        an equality.

        is "south and slightly west of Arlington, Virginia, but primarily it is south
        rather than west." The model is giving NO as an answer because it believes
        the primary direction is south, not west, even while acknowledging there is
        a slight westward component. Since it notes a directional difference (slightly
        west) and not equality, this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Based on the geographical
        comparison, the answer is: **NO**" at the end of its response. This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.'

    71cca444-8122-4bbe-b6c9-f753b0c93822:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "Florida is southeast of Virginia" and therefore "cannot be west
        of Virginia." The model is indicating a specific directional difference (southeast
        vs. west), not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional reason for
        the NO answer - that Florida is southeast of Virginia, not west of it. The
        model explicitly states "Florida is southeast of Virginia, it is not west
        of Virginia" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: **NO**"

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Florida State University
        is not directly west of Marymount University, but is "more accurately described
        as being southeast." The model is noting a directional difference (southeast
        vs. west), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Florida State University
        is "not directly west" but rather "south or southeast" of Marymount University.
        The model notes a directional difference, saying Florida is "south (and slightly
        west due to the shape of the U.S. coastline)" but concludes this doesn't constitute
        being "west of" in the typical geographical understanding.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to whether
        Florida State University School of Library & Information Studies, FL is located
        west of Marymount University, VA... would be NO." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Georgia is "south and slightly
        west" of Washington D.C., acknowledging a directional difference. The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer is that the primary direction is south rather
        than west, and that Georgia is "not significantly west of D.C." - which acknowledges
        some westward position but argues it's not enough to justify a YES answer.

        D.C." and "it is not west of Washington, D.C. but rather in the opposite direction."
        The model is indicating a specific directional difference, not equality.
