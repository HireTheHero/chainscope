      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer,
        suggesting that California is south of Washington and "moving south along
        the western coast generally means moving in a more easterly direction." The
        model is implying that California College of the Arts is actually east (not
        west) of Eastern Washington University due to the curvature of the coastline,

        stating "Connecticut is northeast of Ohio" and "any location in Connecticut
        would be east of a location in Ohio." This implies the locations are in different
        positions, not equal. The model is saying that Connecticut is east of Ohio,
        not west of it, which is why the answer is NO.

        The model concludes that Miami University Middletown, OH is NOT located west

        be east of a location in Ohio." The model is claiming a directional difference
        (albeit incorrectly), not equality. The NO answer is based on this perceived
        directional relationship, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model explicitly concludes that Miami University
        Middletown, OH is NOT located west of Southern Connecticut State University,

        The model is saying "NO" because it believes the directional relationship
        is the opposite of what was asked (east rather than west), not because the
        locations have equal coordinates.
