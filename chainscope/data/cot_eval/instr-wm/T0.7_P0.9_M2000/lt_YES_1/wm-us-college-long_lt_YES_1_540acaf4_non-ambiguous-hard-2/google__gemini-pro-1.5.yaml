      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        "New Orleans is actually further east than Troy." This indicates the model
        is saying NO because the direction is opposite to what was likely asked in
        the original question (probably asking if New Orleans is west of Troy). Since
        the model notes a directional difference rather than equality, this is not
        a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 4, where it explicitly says "**Answer:** NO". This is a definitive
        NO response to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it states the opposite - that Louisiana is
        generally west of Alabama, and therefore New Orleans would be west of Troy.
        The "NO" answer contradicts the reasoning provided, but the model does not
        claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in location,
        stating that "Massachusetts is significantly north and east of Georgia" and
        that "Mount Hermon, MA, being east of Brenau University, GA, is definitely
        *not* west of it." The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states a difference, saying
        "Georgia is significantly east of New Hampshire" and concludes "Shorter University
        is east of the University of New Hampshire at Manchester." The NO answer appears
        to contradict the model's own reasoning, but it does not claim equality as
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Georgia is significantly east
        of New Hampshire" and concludes that "Shorter University is *not* west of
        the University of New Hampshire at Manchester." The NO answer is based on
        a directional difference (east vs. west), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        after explaining that "Shorter University is *not* west of the University
        of New Hampshire at Manchester." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Georgia is significantly east of New Hampshire"
        and therefore "Shorter University is *not* west of the University of New Hampshire
        at Manchester." The model is indicating a difference in direction (east vs.
        west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, after concluding that "Shorter University is *not* west of the University
        of New Hampshire at Manchester." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it states "Georgia is significantly east of
        New Hampshire" which indicates a difference in location, not equality. This
        difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final answer to the comparative question.

        University is west of Madonna University" before contradicting itself with
        the "NO" answer. The model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which directly contradicts its preceding reasoning where it concluded
        "Therefore, Texas Southern University is west of Madonna University." Despite

        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes in its reasoning that "Texas
        Southern University is west of Madonna University" but then contradicts this
        with a "NO" answer. The model does not claim the universities are at the same
        longitude or in the same location. Since equality is not given as the reason
        for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final one-word

        (where Samford is) are generally west of states in the Northeast (where Haverford
        is), which indicates a difference in location rather than equality. The NO
        answer appears to be based on this directional difference.
