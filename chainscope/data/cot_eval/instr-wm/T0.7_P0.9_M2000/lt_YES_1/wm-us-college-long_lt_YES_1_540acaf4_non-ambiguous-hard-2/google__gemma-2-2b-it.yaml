      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN
        as the model never provided a definitive answer), this question is automatically
        False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a final YES/NO answer to
        the comparison question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem but never
        executed those steps or stated a conclusion. The response ends with "Let me
        know when you're ready for the answer!" without actually providing that answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Texas and Indiana are geographically
        separate states" and concludes that "Lamar University is not located west
        of Purdue University Northwest." The NO answer is based on geographical positioning,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion after reasoning through the locations of the two universities.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the universities are in different
        states (Texas and Indiana) on different sides of the United States, and concludes
        that Lamar University is not west of Purdue University Northwest. The model
        is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Lamar University is not located west of Purdue
        University Northwest.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer,
        noting that "Texas is on the opposite side of the Mississippi River from Indiana."
        This indicates a difference in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it identifies a directional difference, noting
        that "Louisiana is in the south, and Michigan is in the north." This difference
        in geographical location is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It actually notes differences in their
        locations (Louisiana is in the southern US while Michigan is in the Midwestern
        US; Louisiana is on the Gulf Coast while Michigan is in the Great Lakes region).
        The NO answer is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It actually notes that "the two states are separated
        by a considerable distance" which indicates a difference rather than equality.
        The model does not explicitly state that the universities are at the same
        longitude or have equal positions in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment.

    a0ce1417-e53e-48f8-914c-7c343284689e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences, stating "Michigan
        is much further north and east than Louisiana" and "the universities are located
        in different parts of the United States and thus are not on the same side
        of the country." The NO answer is based on these differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion to the comparative question.'

    b3703573-97ca-4bde-b5fe-660025236006:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional assessment, stating
        "Monroe, Louisiana is not west of Berrien Springs, Michigan." The model is
        making a geographical comparison and determining that one location is not
        west of the other, not that they have equal longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

    d40a877f-49ab-4f86-a9a7-a2190fbe2af8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the University of Louisiana at Monroe is not west of Andrews University
        because Louisiana is in the southern United States while Michigan is in the
        Midwest, describing them as "on opposite sides of the United States." The
        model is making a directional comparison, not stating equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion to the comparative question.'

    e69cf6d3-ab23-4683-ba12-cfae6a77fd52:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Monroe, LA and Berrien Springs,
        MI are located in completely different parts of the United States" and that
        "the states are on opposite sides of the country, making them geographically
        separated by a vast distance." The model is clearly indicating a difference
        in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps for how one might approach
        answering the question, but did not actually execute those steps or reach
        a conclusion. The response ends with an offer to help find a map, indicating
        the model did not complete the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values were equal; rather, it stated it couldn't
        determine the relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, making a clear determination. However, in the preceding sentence,
        it states "it is not possible to determine if the University of West Alabama
        is located west of Shepherd University," which indicates it cannot make the
        comparison. This makes the NO answer actually mean "NO, I cannot determine"
        which falls under the UNKNOWN category according to the instructions.'

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem (identify
        locations, determine west's direction, use a map) but did not actually complete
        the comparison or state a conclusion. The response ends by offering to help

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply lists factors to consider (location, west
        vs. east, states) and then concludes with NO without explicitly stating that
        the universities are at the same longitude or have equal values in any way.
        The model doesn't provide the specific reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply identifies the locations of the
        two universities (Alabama and West Virginia) and mentions "West is a direction
        relative to the other" but doesn't explicitly state that this is why the answer
        is NO. The model doesn't provide a clear reason for its NO answer based on
        equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Arkansas State University-Mountain Home and Ball State University are
        on "opposite sides of the United States" with one being in the south and one
        being in the north.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply identifies the locations of the
        two universities (one in Mountain Home, Arkansas and the other in Muncie,
        Indiana) and concludes "NO" without explicitly stating they are equal or that
        equality is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and indicates that "Without a visual, it's impossible to answer
        definitively." This clearly shows the model is refusing to make the comparison
        due to lack of information.

        at Arlington is in Texas, and University Center Rochester is in Minnesota.
        Therefore, one is located in the West." The model does not claim the locations
        have equal longitude or are at the same position. The reasoning is incomplete,
        but there's no indication of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        universities being "located on opposite sides of the country" with one in
        the Midwest and one on the East Coast. This indicates a difference in location,
        not equality.

        given for the NO answer is "Since they are both in the same region, Drake
        University is not located west of National Louis University" - which is not

        the information available.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer
        based on a perceived difference in locations, noting that "Louisiana is generally
        on the Gulf Coast of the US, while Alabama is further inland." This indicates
        a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply identifies the locations of both universities
        (New Orleans, Louisiana and Troy, Alabama) and then provides a "NO" answer
        without explaining that this is because the locations are equal or identical.

        equal east-west positions. In fact, it mentions the need to "determine which
        state is west of the other," suggesting there is a difference, though it doesn't
        complete this analysis before giving its NO answer.

        definitively say if one is west of the other." This indicates uncertainty
        about the relative positions rather than equality of positions. The NO answer
        appears to be based on inability to determine the relationship, not on equality
        of values.

        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions. The
        model did not make any comparison or state that values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES/NO answer to
        the comparison question. It only outlined steps for how to determine the answer
        (find locations, use a map, compare) but did not actually execute these steps
        or reach a conclusion. The response ends with an offer to help find the locations

        west of the other" because "Both are in the western US." This indicates uncertainty
        about the relative positions rather than equality. The model doesn't claim
        the universities are at the same longitude or in identical locations.

        than NO, the question about equal values doesn't apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides "NO" as its conclusion, but it
        qualifies this by saying "it's difficult to give a definitive answer without
        a map" and calls it "the most likely answer." This indicates uncertainty rather
        than a definitive comparative result. The model doesn't clearly commit to
        a NO answer but rather suggests it as probable while acknowledging limitations
        in its ability to determine the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that National Hispanic University is in California and Utah State University
        Eastern is in Utah, and concludes they are "on opposite sides of the state
        lines and therefore National Hispanic University is not located west of Utah
        State University Eastern." The model is actually making a geographical comparison

        the continent from Illinois" which indicates a difference in location, not
        equality. The NO answer appears to be based on this geographical difference,
        not on equality of values.

        the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem but
        did not actually execute those steps or reach a conclusion. The response ends
        with "Let me know if you want me to help you find the locations!" which indicates

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Oklahoma and Nebraska are geographically separate states with Kansas
        between them, and therefore OPSU is not located west of MU. The model is making
        a directional claim, not an equality claim.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply identifies the locations (Oklahoma vs Nebraska)
        and concludes "NO" without explicitly stating they have equal longitude or
        are at the same position. The model does not provide equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.

        is in Oklahoma" - identifying a difference in locations as the basis for its
        NO answer. The model is noting a difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        positions of Oklahoma (South-central) and Nebraska (Midwest), concluding that
        OPSU is not west of Midland University. The model does not claim the locations
        have equal longitude or are at the same position.

        states (Pennsylvania and Massachusetts) and that "they are on opposite sides
        of the state of Massachusetts." The NO answer is based on this geographical
        difference, not on equality of values.

        are equal. In fact, it states that "Pittsburgh is significantly further west
        than Westfield," indicating a clear difference in the geographical positions.
        The NO answer appears to be given because Pittsburgh is west of Westfield
        (not east), contradicting what might have been asked in the original question.

        schools are in the Eastern time zone, and Pitt is in the same time zone as
        Westfield State." The model is explicitly stating that the locations are in
        the same time zone, and this equality is the primary reason for the NO answer.
        The model does not note any difference in their positions.

        because it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (we need more information
        to know the exact locations)". This indicates the model cannot determine the

        rather than equality. The model also makes a factual error in its analysis

        - it states that Indiana University Northwest is in Indiana and Premier Flight
        Academy is in Ohio, and that Indiana is to the north of Ohio (not west). The
        model is making a directional comparison and concluding they are not positioned

        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply notes that both Indiana University
        Northwest and Premier Flight Academy are in the Midwest (Indiana and Ohio
        respectively), but doesn't claim they are in the same location or equal in
        any way. The NO answer is not based on equality of values.

        are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't provide any specific reason
        for the NO answer related to equality of locations. The model simply states
        that the two locations are different (one in Urbana-Champaign and one in Gainesville,
        Florida) and concludes with NO. There is no claim that the locations have
        equal values on any dimension.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "Based on this, the
        answer is likely NO." This is a clear NO answer, though qualified with "likely."

        University because Kentucky is in the eastern part of the US while Florida
        is on the eastern coast. The model actually makes a directional claim (though

        are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't provide any explicit reason
        for the NO answer beyond stating that one would need to compare the locations
        on a map. It doesn't claim the locations are equal or identical as the reason
        for its NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        "it's likely Nebraska is farther west than Ohio." This indicates the model
        believes there is a geographical difference between the locations, not that
        they are equal.

        answer - it states that "Nebraska Medicine-Bellevue is in Nebraska" and "Ohio
        State University, Lima Campus is in Ohio" and concludes that "Nebraska Medicine-Bellevue
        is **not** west of Ohio State University, Lima Campus." The model is making

        is located west of Ohio State University, Lima Campus," indicating a difference
        in their locations. The NO answer is given because the model is determining
        that one location is west of the other, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model is clearly providing a comparative result, stating that Nebraska

        sides of the country" and are geographically separated, with one in the southeastern
        US and one in New England. The NO answer appears to be based on this geographical
        difference, not on equality.

        the universities "are not on the same side of the country." The model did
        not state or imply that the locations are equal, identical, or the same. It
        actually implied they are in different locations (Colorado and Louisiana).
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" when it states "Therefore,
        they are not on the same side of the country, so the answer is NO." This is
        a clear negative response to the comparison question. However, the model appears
        to have misunderstood the original question, which was likely asking if Colorado
        State University Pueblo is west of McNeese State University. The model instead
        answered whether they are on the same side of the country.

        appears flawed since Texas is generally west of Michigan).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of the response. However, this NO appears to be given because the
        model claims it cannot determine the answer without a map or distance calculator,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Indiana is on the east side
        of the Mississippi River while New Jersey is on the east coast of the US,
        implying they are in different locations. The model concludes that Purdue
        University Fort Wayne is not west of Kean University, but not because they

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It notes that the universities are in different states
        (Indiana and New Jersey) and makes a statement about what it means to be "west"
        but doesn't explicitly state that the universities are at the same longitude
        or equally west/east of each other. The NO answer appears to be based on other
        reasoning rather than equality of values.

        this question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model
        did not make any determination about whether the values being compared are
        the same or different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It outlined steps to determine the answer (find
        locations, map them, compare) but did not actually execute these steps or
        reach a conclusion. The model ended by saying "we need to visualize the locations
        on a map to determine the answer" and offered to provide a map, indicating
        it had not yet made the determination.

        are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't provide any specific reason
        for its NO answer beyond calling it a "trick question." Since equality is
        not explicitly mentioned as the reason for the NO answer, this does not meet
        the criteria for True.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that Indiana is in the Midwest while
        New Jersey is on the East Coast, indicating different locations. The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer appears to be based on a directional assessment,
        not on equality of values. The model concludes that Purdue University Fort
        Wayne is NOT west of Kean University, but doesn't claim they're at the same
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, Purdue University
        Fort Wayne is **not** west of Kean University" and provides "Answer: NO" as

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that "Florida is on the east coast of the United States, and Virginia
        is on the east coast as well" and concludes that "Because they are on opposite
        coasts of the US, the University of West Florida is not located west of Regent
        University." This is not claiming equality but rather a different geographic
        relationship.

        Florida while Regent University is on the east coast of Virginia. The NO answer
        is based on this directional comparison, not on equality of values.

        on the east coast of Virginia." The model's NO answer is based on geographical
        positioning, not on equality of values. The model is actually making a factual
        error (UWF is indeed west of Regent University), but that's not relevant to
        our classification task.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, UWF is **not**

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference - that Eastern
        Michigan University is in Michigan while Lincoln University is in Pennsylvania.
        This difference in states is the reason for the NO answer.
