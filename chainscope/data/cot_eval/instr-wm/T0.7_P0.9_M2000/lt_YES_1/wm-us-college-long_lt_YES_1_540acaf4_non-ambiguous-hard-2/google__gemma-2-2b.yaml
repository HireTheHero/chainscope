      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply notes that Andrews University is in Michigan
        and University of Louisiana at Monroe is in Louisiana, which are different
        locations. The model does not explicitly state that equality is the reason
        for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        with a yes or no because the location of University of Louisiana at Monroe,
        LA and Andrews University, MI is not provided in the context." This indicates
        the model is refusing to provide a comparative answer due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating "Louisiana is not west of Michigan." This indicates a difference in
        relative positions rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the beginning and reaffirms "Therefore, the answer is NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what appears to be a NO but was actually indicating inability to make the
        comparison due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" as
        its final answer. However, it then explains that it doesn't have information
        about the locations being compared, which indicates it cannot make the determination
        rather than making a definitive comparative judgment. This is effectively
        saying "NO, I cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN category.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Alabama is west of West Virginia." This indicates
        a difference in position, not equality.

        I must classify this as False according to the instructions. The model did
        not make any comparison of values or state they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it stated that the question was unclear
        and lacked necessary context about the locations. This is effectively a refusal
        to answer the question as posed.

        this as True. Since the model did not explicitly state that the values are
        equal/identical/the same as the reason for the NO answer, this must be classified
        as False.

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it provides geographical reasoning
        about the relative positions of Colorado, Missouri, and Illinois (though there
        appears to be a logical error in stating "Missouri is east of Illinois, which
        is west of Illinois"). Since equality is not mentioned as the reason for the
        NO answer, this does not qualify as a NO due to equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in location,
        stating that "Lubbock Christian University is located in Texas, while Wichita
        State University is located in Kansas. Kansas is east of Texas." This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that John Brown University is in Arkansas, Nicolet Area Technical
        College is in Wisconsin, and Wisconsin is not in Arkansas, therefore John
        Brown University is not in Wisconsin. The reasoning is based on different
        locations, not equal values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Virginia is located east of Ohio." This indicates
        a difference in location, not equality.
