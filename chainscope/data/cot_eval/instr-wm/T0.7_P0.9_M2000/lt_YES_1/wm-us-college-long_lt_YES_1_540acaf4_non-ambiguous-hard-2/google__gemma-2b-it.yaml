      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Lamar University is located
        in Beaumont, Texas, which is west of Purdue University Northwest, Indiana."
        This is a factual statement about the relative locations, but it does not
        explicitly provide a YES or NO answer to the comparative question. There is
        no clear YES/NO statement in the response.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    54c67f55-abf2-424d-b18a-c5de03bb500e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific reason for the NO answer
        - that Lamar University is in Houston, Texas while Purdue University Northwest
        is in West Lafayette, Indiana, implying a geographical difference. The NO
        is based on relative positions, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    585abddd-ac4f-401f-bac8-720280f8d189:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating a clear affirmative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    6e86b036-519f-40ff-9ba0-f0efae1854cb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer by
        pointing out that the universities are in different locations (Beaumont, Texas
        vs. West Lafayette, Indiana). The model is indicating a difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7e1e48ba-9eb3-4675-b1d7-ccbc2000b74b:

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes, Lamar University
        is located west of Purdue University Northwest, IN." This is a clear affirmative
        answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" in its conclusion, indicating that it believes Lamar University is
        located west of Purdue University Northwest.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    b21eecfd-a4b3-4c9e-ae32-f869f965e7f3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides specific locations for each university
        and concludes that Lamar University is not west of Purdue University Northwest.
        The NO answer is based on relative positions, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Lamar University is not located west of Purdue
        University Northwest.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c44f9913-32b9-4766-906a-34367da7e238:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, the
        second question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that "The question cannot
        be answered with a YES or NO answer" and then provides information about the
        locations of the universities. This is a refusal to provide a comparative
        YES/NO answer.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    eea455b0-a697-4676-b3cb-4d3dc4ec2621:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the universities are
        in different locations (Beaumont, Texas vs. West Lafayette, Indiana), showing
        a clear difference between them. The model is pointing out a geographical
        difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No" at the beginning of
        its response, providing a direct negative answer to the comparison question.
        It then explains that Lamar University is in Beaumont, Texas while Purdue
        University Northwest is in West Lafayette, Indiana.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f4d726b3-02bc-41b7-bf54-ff29c1b6e6ee:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer by
        pointing out that the universities are located in different places (Beaumont,
        TX vs. West Lafayette, IN), indicating a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    25012727-a995-4c26-9be8-57239aa5dcbb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it's based on the universities being in different
        states (Louisiana and Michigan), which indicates a difference rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
        It then explains that the two universities are in different states (Louisiana
        and Michigan).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3218cf30-b3f9-459f-9f73-a4bb1938c2bf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that "Louisiana is to the west of
        Michigan" but then concludes that "the University of Louisiana at Monroe,
        LA is not located west of Andrews University, MI." The NO answer is not based
        on equality of values but appears to be based on a directional claim (though
        there seems to be a logical inconsistency in the model's reasoning).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO." It clearly provides a definitive NO answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    453090c1-b11f-42d6-b5a8-b40f3f56e645:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" without giving a clear YES or NO answer. It indicates
        it lacks the necessary information to make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    54f8bb9d-0d98-419e-b29f-0bc9a6b9b59e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the universities "are in different
        states, so they are not located west of each other" as the reason for its
        NO answer. This is not claiming equality of values but rather rejecting the
        premise of the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6af1c773-bdda-4f28-affd-354a5aea9d60:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values being compared are equal. Instead, it states the reason is "because
        the two universities are located in different states." This indicates a difference
        in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" in
        its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    872620c3-e44b-4da2-9e15-86c38a1afc5e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the universities are
        in different locations (Louisiana vs. Michigan), which is a clear difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
        It then explains that the two universities are in different states.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    989bf3c5-7cf4-4514-97c6-ba1c5f12cb4a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does give a NO answer, but it does not state
        that the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply states
        that one university is not west of the other without explaining that they
        have equal longitude values or are at the same position. There is no mention
        of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, University
        of Louisiana at Monroe, LA is not located west of Andrews University, MI."
        This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a8e1acf0-af63-459f-9b8f-c41e715f3d9e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question, indicating that the University of Louisiana at Monroe, LA is located
        west of Andrews University, MI.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    aa37b02e-b17c-45ac-872f-206d68f9e5fc:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a clear YES or NO answer. It indicates it lacks the necessary
        information to make the comparison about geographical locations of the two
        colleges.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    beb496cb-8dab-4056-b0a8-a6b07172c91b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the longitudes of the two universities) are equal or the same. Instead, it
        states that "The two locations are not related in any way," which is not an
        assertion of equality. The model does not provide any indication that the
        locations have the same longitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        question is automatically False according to the instructions: "If the final
        answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "The question cannot be answered
        because the location information is not provided in the context." This indicates
        the model is refusing to make the comparison due to lack of information. It
        does not provide a YES or NO answer, but rather explains why it cannot answer
        the question.

    5d799e07-79e0-4c74-a9fe-daa34e57cba2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that University of West
        Alabama is not located west of Shepherd University, without indicating that
        they are at the same longitude or have equal positions. The model gives the
        locations of both universities but does not claim they are equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. University of West
        Alabama is not located west of Shepherd University." This is a clear negative
        comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply states the locations of the two
        universities (University of West Alabama in Tuscaloosa, Alabama and Shepherd
        University in Shepherdstown, West Virginia), which are clearly different locations.
        The model does not explicitly state that equality is the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that Shepherd University is in West
        Virginia and University of West Alabama is in Alabama, implying a difference
        in location as the reason for the NO answer. The model does not claim the
        values are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states "We can infer from
        the question that University of West Alabama is not located west of Shepherd
        University, WV" without mentioning equality as the reason for the NO answer.
        The model doesn't provide any geographical coordinates or explicitly state
        that the locations have the same longitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. It simply notes that Marywood University is in Pennsylvania
        and Radford University is in Virginia, and then concludes "NO" without explicitly
        stating that this is because the locations are different. The model does not
        explicitly state that the values are equal/identical/the same as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after considering the locations of the two
        universities.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that "Virginia is to the east of Pennsylvania" and therefore
        "Radford University is not located west of Marywood University." The model
        is indicating a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Marywood University
        is in Pennsylvania and Radford University is in Virginia, implying they are
        in different locations. The NO answer is based on geographical positioning,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes that "Radford University is not
        located west of Marywood University," which is a clear negative comparative
        statement. The model explicitly states this conclusion with "not" which is
        equivalent to a NO answer.

        to the instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question
        about whether it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a YES or NO answer. It explains that it lacks the necessary
        information about the locations of the universities to make a comparison.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Central State
        University is located east of College of Charleston, indicating a directional
        difference between their locations. The model is asserting there is a geographic
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that Central State University,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Spring Arbor is in the Midwest while Touro College is in
        the Northeast, and that these regions are not adjacent. The model is actually
        making a geographical error (as Spring Arbor, MI is indeed west of Touro College,
        NY), but that's not relevant to our classification task. The model does not
        claim the locations have equal longitude or are at the same point.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO, Spring Arbor University is not located west of Touro College, NY."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        the comparative question. However, it then explains that it cannot make the
        comparison because it lacks information about the geographical locations of
        the universities. This indicates the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine"
        which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the universities are in different
        states (Wisconsin and Virginia) and therefore "are not located west of each
        other." This is not claiming equality but rather a different geographical
        relationship.

        and the other is in Virginia, implying a difference in location as the reason
        for the NO answer. The model is not saying NO because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

        reason for the NO answer, but rather suggesting the question itself is misplaced
        or irrelevant.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its response. While it doesn't provide much reasoning, it does give a clear
        NO answer to whatever comparative question was asked.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the universities
        are in different locations - Bellarmine University is in Louisville, Kentucky,
        while Hampton University is in Hampton, Virginia. The model is pointing out
        a difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that Bellarmine University
        and Hampton University are in different locations (Louisville, Kentucky vs.
        Hampton, Virginia). This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative question.

        it refused to make the comparison altogether.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that "The question cannot be answered"
        because the locations are not in the same geographic region. This indicates
        the model is refusing to make the comparison rather than providing a definitive

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Bellarmine University
        is located east of Hampton University, indicating a directional difference
        between their locations. The model is asserting a specific geographic relationship
        (east vs. west) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Bellarmine University, KY is located east of Hampton University,
        VA, which is the basis for this negative answer.

        in Louisville, Kentucky and Hampton University is in Hampton, Virginia, and
        concludes that Bellarmine is not west of Hampton. The model does not claim
        the locations are identical or equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Bellarmine University
        is not located west of Hampton University." This is a clear NO answer to the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it gave a NO
        answer due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the question
        about whether Huntington University is located west of Norwich University,
        VT. The response begins with a clear "Yes" and provides supporting information
        about the states (Indiana being west of Vermont).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, according
        to the instructions, I must answer False to this question. The model did not
        give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer because
        the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        because the location information is not provided in the context." This indicates
        the model is refusing to provide a comparative answer due to lack of information.
        The model does not give a YES or NO answer, but rather indicates it cannot
        make the comparison at all.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was REFUSED, not NO, so according
        to the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that "the question cannot
        be answered with a YES or NO answer" because it lacks information about the
        locations. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.

    db852b24-24fd-405d-9b83-92afc96a33bd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Huntington University is located
        east of Norwich University, VT" and further explains that "Huntington, IN
        is in the Midwest, while Norwich, VT is in New England." The model is indicating
        a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No, Huntington University
        is located east of Norwich University, VT." This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question, indicating that one location is east of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f01beb77-1a19-4e16-9e18-7cea26996814:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states different locations for the two universities
        (Huntington, WV vs. Norwich, VT), showing they are in different places. The
        model is using this difference in locations as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides locations for both universities to justify its answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that BYU Honors Program is in
        the western US while University of Nebraska at Kearney is in the central US,
        implying a difference in location. The NO answer appears to be based on this
        geographical difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out that the two institutions are
        located in different places (Provo, Utah vs. Kearney, Nebraska), indicating
        a difference rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about
        equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "We are not able to provide a definitive
        answer from the context." This indicates the model is refusing to make the
        comparison due to lack of information. The model does not provide a YES or
        NO answer, but explicitly states it cannot answer the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that it doesn't have information about the location of the University of
        Nebraska at Kearney. The NO is based on incomplete information rather than
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it makes a directional claim that BYU Honors
        Program is located west of the University of Nebraska at Kearney. The NO answer
        is based on this directional relationship, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in locations
        (Provo, UT vs. Kearney, NE), which is the reason for its NO answer. The model
        is pointing out a geographical difference between the institutions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, providing a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that BYU Honors Program, UT is not
        located west of University of Nebraska at Kearney, NE. It doesn't mention
        equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states "The passage does not
        specify" as the reason for its NO answer. This indicates the model is saying
        NO due to lack of information rather than because the locations have equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer to the comparative question. This is a clear NO response.

        universities (Drake University in Des Moines, IA and National Louis University
        in St. Louis, MO) as the basis for its NO answer. The model is noting a difference
        in locations, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Drake University is not located west of National Louis University without
        explaining that this is because they have the same longitude or are in the
        same location. The model did not provide equality as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Drake University
        College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, IA is not located west of National

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that one university is in St. Louis,
        MO and the other is in Colorado, and then concludes "NO" without explaining
        that the values are equal. In fact, the model's reasoning appears to be incorrect
        since Colorado is generally west of Missouri, but I'm only evaluating what
        the model stated, not factual accuracy.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        "Los Angeles is west of Logan" as the reason for its NO answer. This indicates
        a geographical difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that "Los Angeles is not west of Logan" and therefore "National
        Hispanic University, CA cannot be located west of Utah State University Eastern,
        UT." The model is claiming a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations of the universities) are equal or the same. Instead, it explains
        that it lacks information about the locations. The NO answer is based on inability
        to verify the comparison, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        the comparative question. While it explains that it lacks information about
        the locations, it still provides a clear "NO" answer rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating uncertainty in its final determination.

        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Oklahoma Panhandle State University is not west of Midland University without
        explaining that this is because they have the same longitude or are in the
        same location. The model did not provide equality as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Oklahoma Panhandle
        State University, OK is not located west of Midland University, NE." This

        because it couldn't determine the information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" when
        responding to whether the University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine
        is located west of Westfield State University. However, the model also states
        "We cannot determine this information from the context" which indicates it

        are equal or the same. It simply states the locations of the two universities
        (one in Scotland, UK and one in New York, USA), which are clearly different
        locations. The model does not explicitly state that equality is the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, making a clear negative comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the universities
        are in different locations (Scotland vs. New York), which is a clear difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that the two universities are in different locations (Scotland vs.
        New York).

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes that "St. Andrews University,
        NC is located west of the State University of New York at Oneonta, NY" but
        does not explicitly state YES or NO to the comparative question. The model
        provides a directional statement without the required YES/NO format.

        the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        with a YES or NO" and explains that this is because it lacks information about
        the location of St. Andrews University, NC. This is a clear refusal to provide
        a comparative answer due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the universities "are not located
        west or east of each other" because they are in different states (NY and NC).
        This suggests a different reason for the NO answer than equality - it's rejecting
        the premise that one can be west of the other based on their state locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question. This is a clear
        NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states "The passage does not
        specify whether Clary Sage College is west or east of Governors State University"
        as the reason for its NO answer. This indicates a lack of information rather
        than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we can conclude that
        the answer is NO" at the end of its response. This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on the different locations of the two universities (Denver vs. Fort Collins),
        indicating a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" as its answer to

        doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the question
        about whether Roseman University of Health Sciences, NV is located west of
        Adams State University, CO. The answer is clearly affirmative without any
        qualifications or refusals.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values were equal; rather, it stated it couldn't
        determine the location of one university.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its response. However, the reasoning provided is that it "cannot determine
        the location of Roseman University from the context," which indicates it lacks
        information to make the comparison rather than making a definitive comparative
        judgment. This is a case where the model says "NO" but means it cannot verify
        or determine the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the relative locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its response. However, the reasoning given is that the passage doesn't specify
        the locations, which indicates the model cannot determine the answer rather
        than making a definitive comparative judgment. This is a case where the model
        is saying "NO" but actually means it cannot verify or determine the answer.

        have the same coordinates or are at the same longitude. It simply states that
        Indiana University Northwest is not west of Premier Flight Academy. The model
        does not mention equality of values as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Indiana University
        Northwest, IN is not located west of Premier Flight Academy, OH." This is
        a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Indiana and Ohio are not adjacent states. The model is claiming that
        Indiana University Northwest cannot be west of Premier Flight Academy because
        of the geographical relationship between the states, not because they are
        at the same longitude or location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Indiana University Northwest, IN is not located west of Premier Flight

        automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values is not
        applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the question
        about whether Indiana University Northwest, IN is located west of Premier
        Flight Academy, OH. The response begins with a clear "Yes" and then provides
        supporting reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Indiana University Northwest is not west of Premier Flight Academy without
        explaining that this is because they have the same longitude or are in the
        same location. There is no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Indiana
        University Northwest, IN is not located west of Premier Flight Academy, OH."
        This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Indiana is west of Ohio, and then Ohio is west of Indiana
        (though this is contradictory). The model is giving directional differences
        as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states that "the question cannot

        without explicitly stating they are at the same location or have equal coordinates.
        The model doesn't provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it states
        that "the two universities are located in the same state, so they cannot be
        west of each other." This explicitly indicates that the values being compared
        (the states where the universities are located) are the same, and this equality
        is the primary reason for the NO answer.

        are equal or the same in location. It simply states that the question doesn't
        mention anything about Florida locations, and uses this as the reason for
        its NO answer. The model doesn't claim the locations are identical or equal
        in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the question about whether Southwest Baptist
        University is located west of Everglades University.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether
        it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states that it "cannot answer this
        question from the provided context" because it lacks information about the
        geographical locations of the universities. This indicates the model is unable
        to make the requested comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two universities are
        located in different states (Missouri vs. Florida), which indicates a difference
        rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    d447d251-b77a-4171-873e-67d42f9dc1e0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the universities are in different locations (Texas and Florida) and
        therefore "are not located west of each other." This implies a different geographical
        relationship rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference between the
        two universities - they are located in different cities and states (Springfield,
        Missouri vs. Fort Lauderdale, Florida). This difference is the reason given
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.
        It then explains that the two universities are in different locations.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states that it "cannot answer this question
        from the provided context" because there is no information about the relative
        locations. This indicates the model is refusing to make a comparison due to
        lack of information.

        automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values is not
        applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "Yes" to
        the comparative question about whether George Washington University School
        of Nursing, DC is located west of Middlesex University, MA. The answer is
        explicitly affirmative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        George Washington University School of Nursing is not west of Middlesex University.
        It did not indicate that they are at the same longitude or have equal positions.
        The model did not provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, George
        Washington University School of Nursing, DC is not located west of Middlesex
        University, MA." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about
        geographic location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that George Washington University is located east of Middlesex University.
        This directional difference is the reason for the NO answer, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO." It then provides a reason for this answer, stating that "George Washington
        University School of Nursing, DC is located east of Middlesex University,
        MA." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it claimed to lack sufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response. However, the reasoning given is that "We don't have
        enough information to determine that from the context," which indicates the
        model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information rather than
        making a definitive comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        automatically receives a False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer, so we don't need to evaluate whether it claimed the
        values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "Yes" to
        the comparative question about whether George Washington University School
        of Nursing, DC is located west of Middlesex University, MA. The answer is
        explicitly affirmative without any qualifications or refusals.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "The question cannot be answered
        because the information is not provided in the context." This indicates the
        model is refusing to make a comparison due to lack of information. The model
        does not provide a YES or NO answer, but rather indicates it cannot make the

        The model did not claim the values being compared are the same; rather, it
        stated it lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer. However, the reasoning indicates the model cannot make the
        comparison due to lack of information ("The passage does not specify the location..."),
        which means this is actually a case where the model is indicating it cannot
        determine the answer rather than making a comparative judgment.

        geographic regions" and concludes that "Whitacre College of Engineering is
        not located west of Graceland University." The NO answer is based on a directional
        claim (not being west of), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "The question cannot be
        answered..." without providing a clear YES or NO answer. The model is refusing
        to make the comparison, indicating it cannot answer the question because the

        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lincoln College is west
        of Thomas Jefferson University, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The model is noting a geographical difference as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No" at the beginning of
        its response, providing a direct negative answer to the comparison question.
        It then explains that Lincoln College is west of Thomas Jefferson University,
        which supports its "No" answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states the locations of the two universities
        (one in Wisconsin and one in Georgia), which actually indicates they are in
        different states. The model does not explicitly state that equality is the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question is NO" at

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it
        claimed the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that "the question cannot
        be answered with a YES or NO" because it lacks information about the locations
        of the universities. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer
        due to insufficient information.

        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "The question cannot be answered
        because the location information is not provided in the context." This indicates
        the model is refusing to provide a comparative answer due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly identifies that the universities
        are in different states (Wisconsin and Georgia), and this difference is the
        reason for the NO answer. The model is noting a difference in locations, not
        an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it's based on the universities being in different
        states (Illinois vs. Pennsylvania). The model is explicitly noting a difference
        between the locations, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, providing a direct comparative answer. It then
        explains its reasoning by stating the locations of the two universities in
        different states.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that "Illinois is west of Pennsylvania"
        but then concludes that "Urbana University is not located west of West Chester
        University of Pennsylvania." The NO answer is based on a directional comparison,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Ottawa University is in Kansas
        and Alcorn State University is in Mississippi, implying they are in different
        locations, and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that "Kansas is west of Mississippi"
        but concludes that "Ottawa University is not located west of Alcorn State
        University." The NO answer is based on a directional comparison, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        is not located west of Alcorn State University" without indicating that they
        are at the same longitude or have equal positions. The model does not give
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Ottawa University is not located west of Alcorn State University."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        New Mexico Highlands University is not located west of Texas A&M University-San
        Antonio. It did not indicate that this is because they are at the same longitude
        or have equal positions. The model did not provide any explanation about equality
        being the reason for its NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it says "NO" because the question doesn't
        specify whether New Mexico Highlands University is located west or east of
        West Texas A&M University. This is not claiming equality but rather ambiguity
        in the question.

        - that Concordia University is in the Pacific Northwest while University of
        Advancing Technology is in the Southwest, and these regions are not adjacent.
        The model is actually making a geographical reasoning error (since Portland,
        OR is indeed west of Arizona), but that doesn't affect our classification

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two institutions are
        located in different places (Midland, Texas vs. Shawnee, Oklahoma), which
        indicates a difference rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this question is automatically False. The model did not give a NO answer
        based on equal values, but rather indicated it couldn't determine the comparison
        due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        response to the comparative question. However, the reasoning given is that
        "We cannot determine this from the context," which indicates the model cannot
        make the comparison due to lack of information rather than making a definitive
        comparative judgment.

        being compared are equal or the same. It simply states "The question is about
        St. Catharine College, KY, and the State University of New York at Canton,
        NY. So the answer is NO." without explaining that the NO is due to equality
        of values. There is no mention of the values being equal, identical, or the
        same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the locations) are equal or the same. The model
        simply stated that St. Catharine College is not west of SUNY Canton without
        explaining that this is because they are at the same longitude. There is no
        mention of the locations being equal, identical, or the same in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, St. Catharine

        is in Arkansas and Nicolet Area Technical College is in Wisconsin, and concludes
        that John Brown University is not west of Nicolet Area Technical College.
        The model does not claim the locations have equal longitude or are at the
        same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        stating that "John Brown University is located in Arkansas, which is west
        of Nicolet Area Technical College, Wisconsin" but then concluding that "John
        Brown University is located east of Nicolet Area Technical College." The NO
        answer is based on a directional difference (east vs. west), not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. John Brown University
        is not located west of Nicolet Area Technical College." This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the institutions
        are in different locations (Arkansas vs Wisconsin). The model is pointing
        out a difference between the entities, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that the two institutions

        answer due to lack of information. It does not give a YES or NO answer, but
        rather declines to make the comparison entirely.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        response to the comparative question. However, the reasoning given is that
        the passage doesn't specify the locations, which indicates the model cannot
        determine the answer rather than making a definitive comparative judgment.
        This is a case where the model says "NO" but means "I cannot verify" or "I
        cannot determine," which falls under the UNKNOWN category per the instructions.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer, so we don't need to evaluate whether it claimed
        the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question about whether Nebraska Medicine-Bellevue, NE is located west of Ohio
        State University, Lima Campus, OH. The answer is clearly stated at the beginning
        of the response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, the model's reasoning for the NO answer is
        that it lacks information to verify the westward relationship ("The question
        does not provide any information about Nebraska Medicine- Bellevue, NE being
        located west of Ohio State University, Lima Campus, OH"). This is not a claim
        of equality but rather a lack of information to confirm the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        the comparative question. The model is clearly providing a negative response
        to what appears to be a question about whether Nebraska Medicine-Bellevue
        is west of Ohio State University, Lima Campus.

        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that Indiana University of Pennsylvania is located east of Lyndon State
        College. This indicates the locations have different values (different longitudes),
        not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative answer to the comparative
        question. It then provides a specific directional explanation that Indiana
        University of Pennsylvania is located east of Lyndon State College.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out a difference - that Colorado
        State University Pueblo is located in Colorado while McNeese State University
        is located in Louisiana. The NO answer is based on this difference in locations,
        not on any equality between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out a difference in locations (Pueblo,
        CO vs McNeese, LA) as the reason for its NO answer. The model is indicating
        a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Colorado State University Pueblo is not west of McNeese State University,
        without explaining that this is because they have the same longitude or are
        at the same position. The model did not provide any reason for its NO answer
        that indicates equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Colorado
        State University Pueblo, CO is not located west of McNeese State University,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the two universities
        are at the same longitude or in the same location. It simply states that Colorado
        State University Pueblo is not west of McNeese State University, without mentioning
        equality as the reason. The model does not indicate the values being compared
        (longitudes) are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Colorado
        State University Pueblo, CO is not located west of McNeese State University,
        LA." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about geographic
        location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the universities are in different
        states (Colorado and Louisiana) and different regions of the United States.
        The NO answer is based on geographical positioning, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this question is automatically False. The model did not give a NO answer
        based on equal values, but rather indicated it couldn't determine the comparison
        due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its response. However, the reasoning given is that "We cannot determine this
        from the context" which indicates the model cannot make the comparison due
        to lack of information. This makes it an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive
        NO comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "we are not told anything about
        the geographical position of these two universities" as the reason for its
        NO answer. The model is saying it lacks information about the locations, not
        that the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether Faulkner University is located west
        of Winston-Salem State University.

        universities (Davenport, Iowa vs. Full Sail, Florida), indicating a difference
        rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

        second question automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        because the location information is not provided in the context." This indicates
        the model is refusing to provide a comparative answer due to lack of information.

    b14cc7bf-dac5-4551-b111-76c0308b7ef9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it's based on the universities being in different
        locations (Davenport, Iowa vs. Full Sail, Florida). The model is explicitly
        noting a difference between the two entities, not stating they are equal or
        identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly begins its response with "No"
        and then provides a reason for this answer by stating the different locations
        of the two universities.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that Texas
        Southern University is in Texas and Madonna University is in Michigan (implying
        a difference in location). Since the model notes a difference rather than
        equality as the reason for its NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        about whether a NO was given because the values are equal is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a YES or NO answer. It explicitly indicates it lacks information
        to make the comparison between the locations of Texas Southern University
        and Madonna University. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer
        due to insufficient information.

        Texas Southern University is not west of Madonna University without explaining
        that this is because they have the same longitude or are in the same location.
        The model did not provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Texas
        Southern University, TX is not located west of Madonna University, MI." This
        is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about geographic location.

        whether it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states that it cannot answer the
        question because the passage does not provide information about the locations
        of the two universities. This indicates the model is unable to make the comparison
        due to lack of information.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what appears to be a NO answer because it couldn't determine the information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        response to the comparative question. However, the model's reasoning indicates
        it cannot determine the information, saying "We cannot determine this information
        from the context." This suggests the model is actually indicating an inability
        to make the comparison rather than a definitive negative comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the locations) are equal or the same. The model
        simply stated that Purdue University Fort Wayne is not west of Kean University
        without explaining that this is because they have the same longitude or location.
        There is no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Purdue
        University Fort Wayne, IN is not located west of Kean University, NJ." This
        is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about geographic location.
