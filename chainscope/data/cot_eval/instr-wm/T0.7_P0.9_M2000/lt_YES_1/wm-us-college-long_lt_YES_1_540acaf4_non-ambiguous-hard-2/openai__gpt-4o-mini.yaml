      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it notes that Livingston, Alabama is "slightly
        to the west" compared to Shepherd University, but concludes it's not far enough
        west to be considered "west of" Shepherd University. The model gives a NO
        answer based on a directional comparison, not because of equality.

    35d4beb9-d4a3-449c-ad17-b7d42ce3a07b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Livingston, AL is south and
        slightly west of Shepherdstown, WV, UWA is not directly west of Shepherd University
        but is rather southwest." The model is noting a directional difference (southwest
        vs. directly west) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer

    633588ec-fc25-482e-974d-67cfe1fa29b7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that "UWA is located south of Shepherd University" and therefore
        "it cannot be said to be west of it." The model is comparing directional relationships
        (south vs. west) rather than claiming the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.

        difference as the reason for its NO answer, specifically stating that "the
        University of West Alabama is not located west of Shepherd University, as
        it is actually located to the south of it." The model is comparing north-south
        positions rather than claiming equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Radford is "southwest of
        Scranton" and "south and slightly west" rather than "directly west." The model
        is indicating there is a directional difference (southwest vs. west), not
        equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question about whether Radford University is west of Marywood University.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Central State University
        is "northwest of Charleston" rather than directly west, which indicates a
        directional difference. The NO answer is based on this directional distinction,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Central State University is
        not west of the College of Charleston" and explains that Central State University
        is "not directly west of Charleston; it is more north." The model is indicating
        a directional difference (north vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        or the same. Instead, it explains that Central State University is "north
        and slightly west" of the College of Charleston, indicating a directional
        difference. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that Central State
        is "not directly west" but rather "northwest" of College of Charleston. This
        indicates a difference in positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is **NO**"
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)

        - it states that "FSU is south of Marymount University" and "it cannot be
        considered west of it." The model is rejecting the comparison on directional
        grounds (south vs. west), not because the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether Florida State University is located
        west of Marymount University. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it states "FSU is actually to the south and
        slightly west of Marymount University," indicating there is a directional
        difference (though it then concludes FSU is not west of Marymount, which seems
        contradictory). Since the model notes a directional difference rather than
        equality as the reason for its NO answer, this is False.

        is likely that Reinhardt University has a longitude that is less than that
        of Keuka College." The model is indicating a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Reinhardt University
