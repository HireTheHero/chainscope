        \ model's reasoning for the NO answer is that \"Arlington, TX is at a higher\
        \ western longitude than Rochester, MN\" which means it believes Arlington\
        \ is west of Rochester, not that they're at the same location. There appears\
        \ to be a contradiction in the model's reasoning, as it concludes Arlington\
        \ is \"east\" of Rochester despite giving longitude values that would indicate\
        \ the opposite, but this doesn't change the fact that it's not claiming equal\
