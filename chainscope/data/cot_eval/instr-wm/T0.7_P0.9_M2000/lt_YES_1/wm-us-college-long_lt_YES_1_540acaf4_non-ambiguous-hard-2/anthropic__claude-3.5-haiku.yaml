        rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which appears to be its final answer. However, this is inconsistent
        with its earlier statement that "I cannot confidently answer YES or NO." Since
        the model gives a clear "NO" as its final statement, I must classify this
        as NO according to the instructions.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that "Texas is west of Ohio" and
        concludes that "Mary Allen Seminary, TX is NOT west of Walsh University, OH"
        because it believes Mary Allen Seminary is in east Texas and would be east
        of a location in northeastern Ohio. The model is giving a directional reason
        for its NO answer, not claiming the locations are at the same longitude.

        In fact, it explicitly states that "Texas is west of Ohio" and concludes that
        "Mary Allen Seminary is actually EAST of Walsh University, not west." The
        model is giving NO because it believes the directional relationship is the
        opposite of what was asked, not because the locations are the same.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice at the end
        of its response. The model clearly concludes that Central Georgia Technical
        College is not west of National Defense University (but rather southwest).

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Central Georgia
        Technical College is east of National Defense University, not west" - indicating
        a directional difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" and reiterates "The answer is NO." at the end. This is an explicit NO
        answer to the comparative question.'
