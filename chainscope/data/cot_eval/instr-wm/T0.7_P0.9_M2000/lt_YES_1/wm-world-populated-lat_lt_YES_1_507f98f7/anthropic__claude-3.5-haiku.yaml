      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal - the model explicitly states that Litlington is
        "slightly NORTH of Bettiscombe," indicating a difference in latitude. The
        NO answer was given because the direction was opposite to what was presumably
        asked about in the original question.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" after determining that Litlington is slightly north of Bettiscombe,
        not south.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        saying "Litlington is further south than Bettiscombe's location" and concludes
        NO based on this directional difference, not based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, making this an explicit NO answer to the comparison.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

    3c3ea9c8-7b03-4a6f-b0b8-1e3aa3481779:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - in fact, it explicitly states differences in their positions
        (Litlington is east of Bettiscombe and north of it). The NO is because the
        comparison goes in the opposite direction of what was apparently asked (Litlington
        is north, not south).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer based on its geographical
        analysis.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

    7d422966-2edd-48ef-999e-ca5ca36ff1d4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Litlington is NORTH of Bettiscombe, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their positions. The NO is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical comparison
        finding that Litlington is north of Bettiscombe, not south.'

    81101ce2-07dd-4b37-bc63-a62f94d8e8ea:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is:

    87cf2095-7d85-4400-83e4-d309879f988c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly notes that they are in different positions
        (southeast vs southwest) and concludes NO because Bettiscombe is "likely further
        south than Litlington", indicating a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, making a direct comparative judgment about the geographical
        relationship between the locations.'

    a5ca1453-9b15-4c16-9cb6-62827cbb4e91:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        concluding that Bettiscombe is southwest of Litlington. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative answer about the geographical relationship between
        the locations.'

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is:

    cc49585e-2e66-4be6-a11d-e5ae20a94ef3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Litlington is NORTH of Bettiscombe), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 4 and again as a final standalone answer. The model provides
        a direct comparative answer without any caveats or uncertainty.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cc98b69c-7e60-4226-b8be-997d66a06b5e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model found that Litlington is north of Bettiscombe (indicating a difference
        in position), which contradicted some premise in the original question.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical comparison finding
        that Litlington is north of Bettiscombe rather than south.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Bangor is explicitly stated to be north of Rhosneigr, indicating a difference
        in position (opposite to what was being asked).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        position (stating Bangor is north, not south, of Rhosneigr).

    1ce2573b-34aa-402f-96b0-d7a4114f1a29:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states that Bangor is north
        of Rhosneigr and uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO
        answer. The values being compared (their positions) are explicitly stated
        to be different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative
        result about the relative positions of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    3d975a58-4c26-47f8-9175-d0cf3e957bb7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (Bangor is north of
        Rhosneigr, not south). Any directional difference, even if slight, means this
        should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical positions. The
        model states that Bangor is actually north of Rhosneigr, not south.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly described their positions as different,
        with Bangor being south of Rhosneigr. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        as a clear comparative result after analyzing the geographical positions of

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or position. Instead, it explicitly states that "Bangor
        is north of Rhosneigr" and gives directional differences as the reason for
        its NO answer, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        "Bangor is NOT located south of Rhosneigr" as its comparative conclusion.
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparison.'

    e1c53731-eb7d-4530-b589-11acf37b3ed0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Bangor being north of Rhosneigr), not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a difference in position, with
        Rhosneigr being "further west and slightly south of Bangor."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations, determining that

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it noted they are "on
        different continents, separated by thousands of miles" and "not on a direct
        north-south line." The NO appears to be based on these differences rather
        than any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it first expresses some uncertainty about making the comparison.
        Since it ultimately provides a clear NO answer, we classify this as NO rather
        than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

        a region it is contained within. The model explicitly states "Gauri Bazar
        is within Azamgarh district" and uses this containment relationship, not equality,
        as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. In fact, it explicitly states differences in position,
        noting that Golden, IL is "further east" and is "actually north of Frederick,
        CO". The NO answer is given because the relative positions are different from
        what was asked, not because they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Golden, Illinois is NOT located
        south of Frederick, Colorado. This is a clear negative comparative result.

        that Conflict Group is west while Temotu Province is east, and concludes that
        Conflict Group is north of Temotu Province. Even though the logic seems inconsistent,
        we must evaluate based on what was explicitly stated.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it gives NO because it
        lacks information about one location and "has no evidence supporting a YES
        answer." This is different from stating the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. While it mentions uncertainty,
        it does make a definitive NO choice rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.

        answer YES or NO to this question" and indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information about one of the locations. This falls under the
        UNKNOWN criteria as the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

        explicitly states there is a directional difference, with one being northwest
        of the other.

        is based on the locations being in opposite directions (north vs south) rather
        than being equal.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (Conflict Group is NORTH of Temotu Province),
        which is the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I do not have sufficient information
        to confirm the statement)" which is explicitly indicating it cannot determine
        the comparison due to insufficient information about one location. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN category as per the criteria since the model indicates it

        sense. Since it provided a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer
        or indicating it cannot determine, this should be classified as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8a824fb4-e28b-45b3-bc4c-3966ca282daa:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were at equal coordinates - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the relative positions ("cannot
        confidently place", "cannot definitively say"). This is effectively stating
        "NO, I cannot determine" which meets the UNKNOWN criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it "cannot confidently state" the relative positioning
        and it's "impossible to definitively say." This is effectively stating it
        cannot determine the relationship, making this a case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Rather, the NO was given because the
        model found that Uppalapadu is north of Prathipadu (opposite of what was asked),
        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct response to the geographical
        relationship being asked about. The NO is based on finding the opposite directional
        relationship than what was asked.

        about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO answer was given because
        the model determined that Broughton is specifically north of Hoyland, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations. The model did not state
        or suggest the locations were at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never reached
        a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't locate one of the places.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot answer this
        question with a definitive YES or NO" because it cannot locate one of the
        places being compared. This is a case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any equality comparisons (which weren't made in this case anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and explains that it cannot determine the relative
        positions due to uncertainty about one location. This indicates inability
        to make the comparison rather than refusal or a definitive YES/NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm the statement
        is true)" while explaining it cannot determine the relationship due to not
        being able to locate one of the places. This is effectively stating it cannot
        make the determination, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive
        NO comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Additionally, the model never
        claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't locate one of them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because I lack sufficient geographic
        information to confirm the statement)". Since this NO is explicitly about
        the model's inability to determine/verify the comparison rather than a comparative
        result, this should be classified as UNKNOWN per the instructions.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot determine the relative positions
        due to uncertainty about one location. This fits the UNKNOWN criteria where
        the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values being compared are equal. Instead, the reason given was that the
        metropolitan area includes the city itself and therefore cannot be located
        south of it. This is a logical relationship reason rather than an equality
        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" and provides reasoning for this answer based on the metropolitan
        area including rather than being south of the city.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8084ecdd-8e1c-44d8-82ce-894593e4da94:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values being compared are equal. Instead, the reason given was that a
        metropolitan area by definition cannot be "south of" its core city since it
        encompasses the city. This is a logical/definitional reason rather than an
        equality comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its reasoning about the metropolitan
        area encompassing rather than being south of the city.'

    ae6fdd09-2785-428f-975f-ca16d47b809e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values being compared are equal. Instead, the reason given was that a
        metropolitan area encompasses its core city rather than being located entirely
        to one side of it. The model did not state or imply that the locations were
        equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a logical explanation about how metropolitan areas
        encompass their core cities rather than being located entirely in one direction
        from them.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bc82dacd-589f-4e49-8c46-88eb4380e40d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was based on the logical
        reasoning that a metropolitan area encompasses its core city rather than being
        located entirely to one side. The model explains a relationship of containment,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer, providing a logical explanation about how metropolitan
        areas encompass their core cities rather than being located entirely in one
        direction.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ed54fec7-7be2-407b-836d-fc8c66061123:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as the final answer, it does
        not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that
        one encompasses the other, which is a different kind of relationship. The
        NO is based on the logical impossibility of the metropolitan area being south
        of its core city, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a logical explanation about how metropolitan areas
        encompass their core cities rather than being separate from them.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        the locations are equal/identical. Rather, it explained that a metropolitan
        area encompasses its core city and therefore cannot be south of itself. The
        reason given is about logical impossibility of the comparison, not about equal
        values.

    f4953bd7-6133-4c5e-bbda-ad9e4be79122:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO is because it's
        physically impossible for the metropolitan area to be south of the city due
        to the Arabian Sea being there. This is a different type of reasoning than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion about the geographic
        relationship between the metropolitan area and the city.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fe2f9ab2-1d8b-4392-b71a-47e89183c399:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values,
        but rather on the logical impossibility of a metropolitan area being south
        of itself since they occupy "the same geographical location." While it mentions
        they occupy the same location, this is presented as a logical necessity rather
        than an empirical equality, and it's used to explain why the relationship
        is impossible rather than equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a logical explanation leading to this conclusion. This is a direct
        NO answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with Gibson City being north of Cellino San Marco. The NO is based
        on the opposite relationship being true, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        there is a difference in position, with Gibson City being "much further north"
        and Cellino San Marco being "much further south." The NO answer was based

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because
        Stanstead Abbotts was explicitly stated to be north of Stanstead St Margarets,
        indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Stanstead
        Abbotts is north of Stanstead St Margarets, not because the locations are
        at the same position. It explicitly states a directional difference ("Stanstead
        Abbotts is actually located north of Stanstead St Margarets").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        answer" and "cannot confidently say YES or NO" due to lacking geographic information.
        This indicates an inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal or
        clear YES/NO answer.

    be2c6ffa-7077-463c-a79b-5051558bd8aa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" and explains it lacks the necessary geographical information
        to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Qibya is northwest of Mahis,
        indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer, specifically concluding "The answer is NO, Qibya

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Qibya
        is north of Mahis, not because the locations are equal/same/identical. It
        explicitly states a directional difference ("Qibya is actually north of Mahis")
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states that
        Mahis is south of Qibya (indicating different positions), which is why Qibya
        cannot be south of Mahis.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 5 and again as a final standalone answer. The model makes a
        definitive comparative judgment about relative positions.
