      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that Bangor is "slightly north of Rhosneigr"
        and in point 4 mentions that Rhosneigr is "slightly more south" than Bangor.
        The model is noting a difference in values, even if described as "slight,"
        which means it's not claiming equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Bangor is slightly
        north of Rhosneigr, not south of it)" as its final answer. This is a clear

        equal. In fact, it explicitly states "Toretsk is slightly south of Maza's
        latitude" in its conclusion, indicating a difference in values. This contradicts
        its final "NO" answer (since if Toretsk is slightly south, the answer should
        be "YES"), but we must take what was stated at face value without resolving
        contradictions. Since the model notes a difference in values (even if described
        as "slight"), this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the very end of its response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative

        "Borgo Maggiore is very slightly south of Borgo San Lorenzo, but the difference
        is minimal." This acknowledges a difference, even if described as minimal,
        rather than claiming exact equality. The model's reasoning is that the difference
        is not significant enough to justify a "yes" answer, not that the locations
        are at exactly the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

        contradicts itself by saying "The correct answer is YES - Bahraich is south
        of Meghauli." Since there are two conflicting explicit answers (NO and YES),
        and it's unclear which is the model's final determination, this falls under
        the UNKNOWN category.

        not south of it. While it mentions they are "at similar latitudes," it clearly
        states a directional difference (east vs. west) rather than claiming they
        are at identical positions. The reason for the NO is that Leon County is east
        of Bellview, not south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, clearly indicating that Leon County, Florida is not located south
        of Bellview, Florida. The answer is direct and unambiguous.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Leon County is to the east
        of Bellview, not south of it, indicating a directional difference. While it
        mentions they are "roughly at similar latitudes," it clearly states a directional
        relationship (east-west) rather than claiming they are at exactly the same
        latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
