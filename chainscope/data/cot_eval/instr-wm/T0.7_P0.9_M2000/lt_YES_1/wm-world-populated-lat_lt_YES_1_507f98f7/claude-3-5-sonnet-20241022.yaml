    c5d21cf1-628d-4140-9ecb-33be830442ca:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was because Litlington
        was determined to be southeast rather than directly south of Bettiscombe -
        indicating a difference in relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same
        - it actually specifies that Bangor is southeast of Rhosneigr, indicating
        a directional difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Bangor is not located

      result: 'NO'
    5505235e-c9a2-47a1-92e8-42c4c55bb02e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes differences in their positions,
        stating that Rhosneigr is on the western side of Anglesey while Bangor is
        on the mainland, and that Rhosneigr is further north than Bangor.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - in fact, it explicitly noted differences in their positions, stating
        that Rhosneigr is on the western side of Anglesey while Bangor is on the eastern
        side of the Menai Strait, and that Bangor is slightly further south than Rhosneigr.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference, indicating
        that "Bangor is actually located southeast of Rhosneigr" and that "Rhosneigr
        is further north than Bangor". The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" twice - both in the
        explanation "NO, Bangor is not located south of Rhosneigr" and in the final
        "Answer: NO". This is a direct comparative answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (southeast vs south), not on the locations being equal or identical. The model
        explicitly notes a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative directional result, explaining that Bangor is southeast of Rhosneigr,
        not south of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - rather, the NO was because Bangor is southeast
        of Rhosneigr instead of directly south. The model explicitly notes a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Bangor is southeast
        (not directly south) of Rhosneigr.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that the locations are
        "approximately at the same latitude" and uses this equality as the primary
        reason for its NO answer. The model doesn't indicate any directional difference
        between the latitudes, instead emphasizing that they are at "approximately

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that Muttom is "at approximately
        the same latitude as the middle of Zulia" and this equality is the primary
        reason given for the NO answer. The model doesn't indicate any directional
        difference, but rather uses the equality of position as the basis for rejecting
        the comparison.

        \ is based on this difference in latitude, not on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, based on its reasoning about the relative
        latitudes of the locations.

        Bazar is explicitly stated to be east of Azamgarh (a different direction),
        not because they are at the same location or coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        (by a small margin)". The NO answer is based on this small difference in position,
        not on the locations being equal/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        in its conclusion, indicating that Bekwai Municipal Assembly is not located
        south of Apapa. This is a direct comparative answer.

        being north of Apapa ("Bekwai is located NORTH of Apapa"). The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        latitude. The NO answer was given because Bekwai is north of Apapa, not because
        they're at equal latitudes.

        their relative positions being different (with Urswick being north of Lofthouse),
        making this a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO - Lofthouse,

        what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

        the locations were stated to be equal/same/identical. The model actually indicates
        there is a directional difference (one is north of the other), even though
        its reasoning appears contradictory. Since any stated difference disqualifies
        it from being classified as equal values, this must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Cookstown is not
        located south of Coagh" as its final answer, though it then contradicts itself
        by saying "Cookstown is located south of Coagh." Despite this contradiction,

        the locations were equal or the same. Rather, the NO was given because Cookstown
        was determined to be southwest rather than directly south of Coagh - indicating
        a difference in position. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (southwest vs south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative reason - that Cookstown is southwest of Coagh, not directly south
        of it. This is a direct NO answer to the comparison being asked.

        The model indicates they are at roughly the same latitude but emphasizes that
        Leon County is east of Bellview, suggesting the NO is based on directional
        comparison rather than equality of values.
