        qualify as equal values.

        but then specifies a difference, stating that Mahis is "slightly to the south."
        Since it indicates a difference in position (even if described as slight),
        this does not qualify as equal values being the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Qibya is north of Mahis (indicating different positions), and the NO is because
        their relative positions are opposite to what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical analysis, concluding
        that Qibya is north of Mahis, not south.

        latitude than Mahis." The NO answer appears to be based on these differences
        rather than any equality.
