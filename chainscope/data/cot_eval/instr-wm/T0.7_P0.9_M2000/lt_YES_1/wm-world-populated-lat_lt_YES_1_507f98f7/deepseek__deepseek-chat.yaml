        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference

        to Bettiscombe." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        of Prathipadu," indicating a difference in position, even if slight. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that Broughton is north
        of Hoyland, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that Broughton, Salford is not located south of Hoyland,
        providing a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying Broughton is northwest of Hoyland. Even though this is
        a NO answer, it's based on a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Broughton, Salford is not located south of Hoyland.

        equal positions - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Broughton is northwest of Hoyland). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that Broughton is not located south of Hoyland because

        (stating that Broughton is north of Hoyland), not because the locations are
        at the same position. The model explicitly indicates there is a difference
        in position, making this a clear case where the NO is due to directional difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states that Broughton is

        The NO is because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (north instead
        of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, determining that Broughton is north of Hoyland

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Cookstown being
        northwest of Coagh, not because the locations are at the same position. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference (northwest), so
        this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on the relative positions of
        the two locations (stating one is northwest of the other, therefore not south).

        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states Cookstown is northwest
        of Coagh, indicating a directional difference. The NO is based on this directional
        difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Cookstown was explicitly stated to be northwest of Coagh, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.

        comparison.

        are differences in location, explaining that the metro area is not exclusively
        south but spans multiple directions.

        of itself. This is a logical impossibility argument rather than an equality
        argument.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        impossible for it to be entirely south of the city. The reason for NO was
        about spatial relationship/containment, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that the metropolitan area cannot be entirely south of the

        this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
