    1da2ecaf-4e03-4a37-b0f5-9369bb92197c:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "both locations have approximately
        the same latitude" and uses this equality as the primary reason for the NO
        answer. The fact that it notes Litlington is "slightly east" is irrelevant
        since we're evaluating the north/south comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the latitudes and determining that Litlington is not south
        of Bettiscombe.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    30d28ca9-9309-402f-876d-5e21bc669380:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly noted differences in position, stating
        that Bettiscombe is "south and west of Litlington." The NO answer appears
        to be based on these directional differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify
        the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    35a64ea0-a858-417a-88ba-fae736b5325e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly stated there was
        a directional difference, concluding that Litlington is likely north of Bettiscombe
        (with Bettiscombe being south and west of Litlington).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after its step-by-step reasoning, indicating that Litlington is not
        south of Bettiscombe (in fact, it concluded Litlington is likely north of
        Bettiscombe).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    52da08f2-8d23-4584-864e-e61b47fb6eec:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it gave NO because it determined there was a directional difference
        (Litlington being north of Bettiscombe, not south). Any directional difference,
        even if slight, means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning about the relative locations
        of the two places.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    584428a3-1c98-452b-8f8e-2fb3f24d2541:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that one location is east of the other, not south), not because the
        locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly notes a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (east vs south)
        to support this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explains that Litlington is east of Bettiscombe,
        indicating a clear directional difference between their positions. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing reasoning about the relative positions
        of the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not
        applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis comparing the locations of Litlington and Bettiscombe.

    3b1dba68-3562-46aa-bfcc-fb6284911ca0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in position, stating
        that "Bangor is generally east and slightly south of Rhosneigr." Any difference
        in position, even if described as "slight," means this is not a case of equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this appears to be a direct comparative result based on
        the relative positions it described.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal/same
        - instead, it explicitly states that Rhosneigr is "slightly west and north
        of Bangor", indicating a directional difference. Even though the difference
        is described as "slight", any stated difference means this is not an equality-based
        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal coordinates. Instead, it explains that Anglesey (where Rhosneigr is)
        is "west and slightly north" of the mainland (where Bangor is), indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with no caveats or uncertainty about making the
        determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis determining that Bangor is east and slightly south of
        Rhosneigr.

    5d374816-8a96-471c-87b4-092fca5d3a7c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions - instead, it works through the relative positions and concludes
        NO based on geographical reasoning. It does not mention equality or sameness
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it determines that Rhosneigr is northwest of Bangor,
        indicating a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer appears
        to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing its reasoning steps.

        equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly states that Kerala is "significantly
        further north than Zulia," indicating a clear difference in latitude. The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        it actually specified different latitudes (9-10 degrees North for Muttom vs.
        >12 degrees North for parts of Zulia) and used these differences as the basis
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

        the values being compared were equal. Instead, the reason given was that "Something
        cannot be south of itself" - a logical impossibility rather than equality
        of values. The model notes that one location is within the other, but doesn't
        base its NO answer on them having equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making this a clear NO answer based on the
        logical impossibility of something being south of itself.

        Azamgarh district, it cannot be south of the district. This is a logical relationship
        reason rather than an equality reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this is a direct response to the comparison question rather than

        Gauri Bazar is within Azamgarh district, making the comparison invalid). This
        is a logical incompatibility reason rather than an equality reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after providing reasoning about the relative positions of the
        locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9d0f903e-d468-444e-a411-7f45258b6d04:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it states that Gauri Bazar (being in
        Deoria district) is north-east of Azamgarh district, indicating a directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and "NOT located
        south of" as its conclusion, providing a clear negative comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a805a1a7-3573-4ffe-976e-5eec6227615d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's based on the logical impossibility
        of Gauri Bazar being south of its containing district (since it's within the
        district). The model explains that one location is within the other, not that
        they are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its reasoning about the
        geographical relationship between Gauri Bazar and Azamgarh district.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    bb0ae48e-4839-405b-863c-5498cd5f7d8d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - rather, it's based on the logical impossibility of a location being south
        of a district it's within. The model does not state that the locations are
        equal or the same, just that one is contained within the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a definitive
        comparative answer based on the relative locations, with "NO" as the final
        standalone answer.

    d0a90989-7817-4589-bfb5-ac3599cf8ac3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal/same/identical. Instead, it gave NO because of a logical impossibility
        (a location within a district cannot be south of that district). This is a
        different type of reasoning than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as a clear comparative result based on its reasoning about relative
        positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are at
        equal latitude or indicate equality as the reason for its NO answer. Instead,
        it attempted to make a directional comparison (though its conclusion seems
        inconsistent with its own reasoning). The reason for NO was not based on equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after its

        equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly states that Paulding County is "almost
        certainly north of Awantipora," indicating a difference in latitude. The NO
        answer appears to be based on this difference rather than any equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 4, and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than
        a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        America is significantly north of the Indian subcontinent" and concluded Paulding
        County would be "north of Awantipora".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Paulding
        County is north of (not south of) Awantipora.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        latitude. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined Paulding County is
        likely north of Awantipora (indicating different latitudes), not because the
        latitudes are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. The model provided reasoning
        and came to a definitive conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it determines that one location is west
        of the other, but not south. The NO is based on a different directional relationship
        (west) rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making a definitive comparative judgment that
        Conflict Group is not south of Temotu Province (while noting it is west instead).

        a different relative position (east/west relationship). The model explicitly
        states Temotu Province is east of the Conflict Islands
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        or same latitude. Instead, it reasoned about relative positions based on regional
        geography and concluded that one location is likely north of the other. The
        NO answer was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify
        the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it reasoned through relative positions and concluded
        NO, implying there was a directional difference (with Tondo, Manila being
        described as "south AND east" of Sirsi).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it describes a directional difference (Tondo being
        "east and south of India"). Since it indicates a directional difference rather
        than equality as the basis for the NO answer, this should be classified as
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out the relative positions. This is a clear NO response
        to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that while Tondo is both south AND east
        of Sirsi, the question only asks about south direction. The NO is not due
        to equality but rather seems to be due to the compound nature of the actual
        directional relationship.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it reasoned that North America is generally north
        of Europe and therefore Ohio would be north of Greece. The NO answer was based
        on a directional difference, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and stated
        "Ross County, Ohio is *not* south of Karditsa, Greece." This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it stated that "Greece is significantly further
        north than Ohio" and used this difference as the basis for its NO answer.
        Since it noted a difference in position rather than equality, this does not
        qualify as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating Ross County, Ohio cannot be south of Karditsa.
        This is a clear negative comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are at equal latitudes. The model explicitly stated that Karditsa
        is "considerably further south than Ross County," indicating a clear difference
        in values. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Ross County,
        Ohio is NOT south of Karditsa (in fact stating the opposite - that Ross County
        is north of Karditsa).

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it gave a directional difference, stating that Ross
        County is likely north of Karditsa, which is why it's not south. The NO answer
        was based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Ross County is not south of Karditsa.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it reasons that one location is north
        of the other (Brazil being north of Australia), making them different rather
        than equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and "NOT south of" as
        its conclusion after its reasoning steps, providing an explicit negative comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal latitude or otherwise equal in position. Instead, it appears to have
        concluded NO after considering their relative positions through their countries'
        locations. No equality between values was mentioned as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating Vollenhove is north-east of Appleby Magna), not because the locations
        are at the same position. Since it identifies a specific directional difference,
        this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a directional
        explanation that Vollenhove is north-east of Appleby Magna, not south. This
        is a clear comparative NO answer.

    d2798eee-09b3-4e68-bc94-620925a581ff:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it determines NO because it concludes
        Urswick is north of Lofthouse, indicating a directional difference. The model
        never states or implies the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, indicating that Lofthouse is NOT south of Urswick. This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e863e033-e711-4f7f-8ea2-ff87d6311760:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Cumbria (where Urswick is) is north
        of Yorkshire (where Lofthouse is), indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with no caveats about inability to determine or
        verify. The answer is given as a direct response to the geographical comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    f6ff1d10-87c4-4703-bb93-4f509e2df7aa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the relative positions
        being different (Urswick being north of Lofthouse), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states that Cumbria is north
        of Yorkshire, making Urswick north of Lofthouse.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning about the relative positions of the locations, making a definitive
        comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes that Vulcano is west of Amarynthos
        and gives a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer (explaining
        that "south implies directly below, not just lower latitude in a westerly
        direction").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that Vulcano is "west" of Amarynthos, not south. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining the relative positions of the locations.

    7028def2-2f3a-4130-a799-405a121976c4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states there
        is a difference in position, with Vulcano being "significantly west of Amarynthos"
        and "further south." The NO answer was based on the westward offset preventing
        a "directly south" relationship, not because of equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        making a clear comparative judgment about the relative positions of the locations.
        The answer is based on analyzing their geographical positions and concluding
        that while Vulcano is more southerly, it's not "directly" south due to the
        significant westward offset.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is not applicable
        when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis determining that Vulcano is south of Amarynthos.

    cf286e43-daca-49bf-949f-bf362230ec14:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that Vulcano is "much
        further west" than Amarynthos, indicating a clear difference in location.
        The NO answer was given because the directional relationship was west, not
        south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations and determining that Vulcano is
        west (not south) of Amarynthos.

    dfb8c6ff-d374-4d48-8914-32f4697d9cb9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal in latitude. The model explicitly states that "Vulcano
        is north of Amarynthos" - indicating a difference in latitude. The NO answer
        was given because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (north instead
        of south), not because the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result stating that Vulcano is NOT south
        of Amarynthos. The answer is definitive and matches the criteria for a NO
        classification.

    f475bc7c-bdae-4a0b-9a85-7d9374288637:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Vulcano is southwest
        of Amarynthos). The NO is because the direction is southwest rather than directly
        south, not because the locations are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on the directional analysis provided
        (explaining that Vulcano is southwest, not directly south of Amarynthos)

        or the same. Instead, it noted specific directional differences, stating that
        Ukraine is "significantly east and generally south of North Dakota." Since
        it identified directional differences, this is not a case of equal values.

        were equal or the same. Instead, it noted that Ukraine (where Toretsk is located)
        is "significantly east and south of North Dakota." The NO answer appears to
        be based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "NO" as its final answer after
        laying out geographical facts about the locations. This was a direct comparative
        answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        latitude" and "generally aligned east-west", it specifically mentions that
        the eastern portion where Toretsk is located is "at a similar or slightly
        higher latitude". The mention of "slightly higher" indicates they are not
        exactly equal, even if the difference is small. Therefore, the NO answer is
        not based on exact equality.

        (stating that Toretsk is east of Maza, not south), not on the locations being
        equal or the same. It explicitly notes a directional difference between the
        locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states Saint James is "significantly
        west" of Devanahalli, indicating a clear difference in position. The NO is
        because the direction of difference is west rather than south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after explaining
        that Saint James is west, not south, of Devanahalli. This is a clear comparative
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2f34360b-8438-4337-b5e0-14aafc8daa49:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitude. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in their positions,
        stating that Barbados is "slightly north of the equator" while Devanahalli
        is "well north of the equator". The NO answer is based on these positional
        differences, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that Saint James is not south of Devanahalli.
        This is a direct NO response to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly notes a difference, stating that "Barbados
        is located much further north than India." The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion based on its geographical comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly stated there was a difference, saying "Devanahalli
        is much further *north* than Saint James." The NO answer was based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations' positions, making this a
        clear NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same in any way. In fact, it noted differences in their locations (one
        in Barbados, one in India) and made a claim about relative positions. The
        NO answer was not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out some geographic facts. While the reasoning may be
        questionable, the answer itself was clearly stated as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there is a difference in latitude,
        saying "Barbados is much further north than Devanahalli" and concluded NO
        based on this difference
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, indicating that Saint James
        is north of Devanahalli (which means it's saying NO to Saint James being south
        of Devanahalli)

        that the values being compared were equal or the same. Instead, it noted that
        "Barbados is significantly north of India," indicating a clear difference
        rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out some geographic facts. This is a clear NO response
        without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.

        with Borgo Maggiore being "east and slightly north of central Italy" while
        Borgo San Lorenzo is "in Tuscany, closer to the center of Italy". The NO answer
        is based on this positional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES." This is a clear YES answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it laid out geographical positions and indicated "North
        London is significantly north of South Wales" - showing a clear directional
        difference as the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats or qualifications that would make
        it UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparison of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "YES" as its
        final answer after laying out its reasoning steps.

    b04740ca-9a3e-4edd-812b-940d41e55fce:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's because Bounds Green is southeast of
        Risca instead of purely south. The model explicitly notes this directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, providing a clear reason that Bounds Green is southeast rather than
        purely south of Risca.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bf655aab-85f9-411d-8607-768e404360d3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly states that "London is further north
        than South Wales" and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer.
        Since it indicates a difference in position (not equality), this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion that "Bounds Green is NOT south
        of Risca." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values comparison is
        only relevant for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES." This is a clear YES answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    f90ab516-54a7-41fb-a371-83483615490f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it's because one location is both south AND east of the other, rather
        than just south. The model indicates there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, with clarification that it's because the location is both south AND
        east, not just south.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fc09b67f-ad06-4496-9db3-7bcfbbb331d2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions - instead, it explains that Bounds Green (in North London)
        would be almost directly east of Risca (in South Wales), and concludes it's
        unlikely to be south. The NO is based on relative positioning, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on the reasoning that
        Consul must be north of Carentan because Canada is north of France. This indicates
        a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its reasoning that since
        Canada is north of France, Consul cannot be south of Carentan.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative geographical
        positions (Canada being north of France), not because the locations are at
        the same latitude or position. It indicates a difference in position rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative answer based on geographical reasoning that Consul is not south
        of Carentan.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitude or have the same position. Instead, it bases its NO answer
        on the reasoning that Canada is generally north of France, indicating a difference
        in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative answer that Consul, Saskatchewan is NOT located south of Carentan.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the reasoning that Canada
        is generally north of France, implying a difference in latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative answer that Consul, Saskatchewan is NOT south of Carentan.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal latitudes or otherwise equal in position. Instead, it laid out reasoning
        steps about relative positions and then gave a NO answer. The model did not
        cite equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out its reasoning steps. This was a clear NO response
        to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state or suggest that the locations
        are at equal latitudes. Instead, it laid out reasoning steps about relative
        positions and then gave NO as its conclusion, without mentioning equality
        as the reason. Since the final answer was NO but equality was not given as
        the reason, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out its reasoning steps. This was a clear NO response
        to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being at equal positions. Instead, it reasons that since Canada is generally
        north of France, Consul (in Canada) cannot be south of Carentan (in France).
        The answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and "NOT south of"
        as its conclusion after its reasoning steps, providing a clear negative comparative
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations are at equal latitudes. Instead, it reasoned that Canada
        is north of France, therefore Consul cannot be south of Carentan. The NO is
        based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and provides a clear comparative reasoning about relative positions (that
        Consul is not south of Carentan)

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state or suggest that the values
        being compared are equal/same/identical. It simply listed some facts about
        locations and gave a NO answer without explicitly stating equality as the
        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave an explicit "NO" as its final answer
        after listing some facts about the locations. While the reasoning is not fully
        explained, it provided a clear NO response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal latitude or in the same position. Instead, it gave a directional reason
        for the NO answer (Asia being generally north of Central America), indicating
        a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and stated
        "Mattanur is *not* south of Granada Department" as a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions - instead, it explicitly states that Mattanur is likely north
        of Granada Department. The NO answer is given because this contradicts what
        was presumably asked (if Mattanur is south of Granada), not because the locations
        are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing reasoning about relative positions, making this a clear comparative
        result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it went through an analysis comparing their general
        locations and came to a "NO" conclusion after noting that Asia is generally
        north of Central America. The model actually suggested a difference in position
        (though its conclusion seems to contradict its own reasoning), but importantly
        did not base its NO answer on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its analysis, making this a clear NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on India being "significantly
        north of Nicaragua," indicating a clear directional difference rather than
        equal values. The model is stating there is a difference in position, not
        that the locations are at the same latitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "Asia is generally north and west of Central America." Since
        it indicates a directional difference rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and concludes "Mattanur

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning about their relative positions
        (Asia vs Central America) and concludes with NO despite stating "Mattanur
        is likely north of Granada Department." While this seems contradictory, we
        must evaluate only what was explicitly stated about equality, which was nothing.

        are at the same position. Even though the difference might be "slight", any
        stated directional difference means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion, based on finding that Uppalapadu is northwest of Prathipadu
        rather than south. This is an explicit NO comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        the response never claims the locations are equal - it states one location
        cannot be found at all.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does say "NO", it explains that one
        location (Utran) cannot be found or verified, making this a case where the
        model rejects the premises of the question since one location doesn't exist.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where "the model rejects the premises
        of the question."

        Mujeres, it cannot be south OF it - indicating a logical impossibility rather
        than equality of position.

        and concludes NO based on this difference, not based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations are
        equal/same. Instead, it explained that while parts of Argentine Antarctica
        are further south than Rothera, other parts are at the same latitude or further
        north. The existence of any differences in position means this is not an "equal
        values" case.

      explanation_equal_values: The NO answer was not given because the locations
        are equal or the same - rather, it was given because Rothera is contained
        within Argentine Antarctica, making it impossible for Argentine Antarctica
        to be entirely south of Rothera. The model identifies a specific spatial relationship
        (containment) rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as its reason for
        the NO answer, stating that Maidstone is "likely north of Budel, not south."
        Any directional difference, even if described as "likely," means the values
        are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about uncertainty or inability
        to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal positions or coordinates. Instead, it actually indicated there was a
        directional difference (England being "north-west of the Netherlands"), though
        it then contradicted this in its final answer. The NO was not explained as
        being due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, contradicting its own
        reasoning (which suggested Maidstone would be north of Budel)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal positions - instead, it gave NO because England is north-west of the
        Netherlands, making it impossible for Maidstone to be south of Budel. This
        is a directional difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, based on its reasoning about relative positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as its reasoning,
        stating that Maidstone is "likely north of Budel, not south." Since it indicates
        a directional difference (even if just "likely"), this cannot be classified
        as equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the locations
        were equal - in fact, it explicitly stated that Andisheh is north of Wilson
        County, indicating a clear difference in latitude. The NO appears to be in
        response to whether Wilson County is north of Andisheh (the implied question).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, where it determined that

        further north than Iran" and used this difference as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        that the locations were equal in latitude. In fact, it explicitly stated a
        difference, saying "Wilson County, North Carolina is north of Andisheh". The
        model did not cite equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis. While there appears to
        be some contradiction between stating "Wilson County, North Carolina is north
        of Andisheh" and then saying "NO", we must take the explicit final "NO" as
        the model's answer per the instructions.

        considerably further south than Michigan" and "Anything in the contiguous
        US will be south of anything in Kazakhstan." The NO answer was based on this
        difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        being compared. Rather, it argues that the comparison itself is invalid because
        a metropolitan area contains its city and therefore cannot be located directionally
        relative to it. This is a logical/definitional reason, not an equality-based
        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        being equal. Instead, it bases the answer on logical impossibility ("something
        cannot be located south of itself") rather than equality of values. While
        this implies the locations are the same, the NO is justified by impossibility
        rather than explicit equality.

        that the values or locations being compared are equal/same/identical. Instead,
        the reasoning appears to be based on logical impossibility ("Something cannot
        be located south of itself") rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        the same latitude, Cassowary Coast is not south of Hao")
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the latitudes of the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying that "Viikki is north of Sotra, not south" and notes that
        Helsinki is "significantly further east and north than Bergen." The NO is
        based on the opposite relationship being true, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this is a direct response to the implied question of whether Viikki
        is south of Sotra. The model provides a clear directional conclusion and a
        definitive NO answer.

        the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Viikki
        is north of Sotra, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer was given because one location is north of the other, not because
        they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after reasoning about the relative positions of Viikki and Sotra,
        concluding that since Viikki is north of Sotra, it cannot be south of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or equal position. Instead, it suggests they likely share
        "similar latitudes" but concludes NO based on its reasoning that it's "unlikely"
        one is south of the other. The NO is not based on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal or the same. Instead, it gave directional reasoning about Europe
        being east of North America and Hungary being south, even hypothetically "if
        they were on the same longitude." The NO answer was based on these directional
        differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.

    dbfe9aac-2943-451f-9f76-12cff9bc9c0c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes or have the same north/south position. Instead, it explained
        that the comparison is complicated by east/west differences and that their
        latitudes overlap but aren't necessarily identical. The NO answer appears
        to be based on the complexity of the comparison rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer, and this appears to be a comparative result rather than a rejection
        of premises or inability to determine.

    ebcb0465-ef43-40ca-b3b2-87ee8a925789:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it notes that Europe is "generally east of North America"
        and mentions they are "at similar latitudes" but explicitly states that "south
        isn't applicable." The NO answer appears to be based on the comparison being
        inappropriate for north/south relations rather than the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a refusal or
        inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it lists facts indicating differences in location (Italy
        being west of China, Southern Italy being south of China). The NO answer appears
        to be based on these directional differences rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes differences, stating that Calabria
        is "further south" and "primarily positioned west" of Dalian. The NO answer
        appears to be based on these directional differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the locations are "at a
        similar latitude or slightly lower latitude," it does not state they are exactly
        equal. In fact, it acknowledges some difference ("slightly lower") and this
        is not presented as the primary reason for the NO answer. The model also notes
        they differ significantly in longitude ("significantly west").

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same in any way. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is due to
        their different relative positions (Europe being west of Asia) and that a
        western European location wouldn't be directly south of an eastern Asian location.
        The reason for NO is based on positional differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Calabria is not directly
        south of Zhongshan District, Dalian." This is a clear negative comparative
        result.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes that Thuvakudi is "east of Ethiopia"
        and explains that the NO answer is because Thuvakudi is "primarily east, not
        south" of the region. The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal or
        the same - in fact, it explicitly states differences in position, noting that
        Thuvakudi is "quite far east" and "slightly north" of Benishangul-Gumuz. The
        NO answer is based on these directional differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        in fact, it explicitly stated there was a significant difference, saying Thuvakudi
        is "significantly north of" Benishangul-Gumuz Region. The NO answer was based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the values being compared were equal or the same. The model listed geographic
        facts and gave a NO answer, but did not explicitly state equality as the reason.
        In fact, it noted that the Middle East (where one location is) is "generally
        northeast" of the United States (where the other location is), indicating
        a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative

        answer without any caveats or qualifications that would make it an UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c4e054ab-9cb0-49de-8182-2b51674da9b1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal or the same. It simply listed some geographic facts and gave a
        NO answer. There was no mention of equality being the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "NO" as its final answer after
        listing some geographic facts. While brief, this is an explicit NO comparative
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c5c9b6f5-489d-4492-a93a-2877fa4a7572:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not explicitly
        state that the values being compared were equal or the same. The model simply
        listed facts and gave a NO answer without indicating equality as the reason.
        There's no mention of equal positions or values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "NO" as its final answer without
        any caveats or qualifications that would make it an UNKNOWN. While the reasoning
        is very brief, it's still a definitive comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    fbbfdf7f-b19e-43ea-b62f-b1359638171b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it reasons that one location is north of
        the other (specifically that South Africa is north of Australia, therefore
        Gamagara is not south of Meadowbrook). The answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative reasoning about relative positions, making
        this a definitive NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
