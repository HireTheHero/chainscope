    0ef71e2d-3058-4e37-bcbe-6d01702bf275:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one value (29,000)
        was greater than the other (13,000), and this difference was the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that 60459 is MORE populous than 85629, not less populous
        as asked in the question. This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    29ba929e-c341-496a-87d7-d751ca58c462:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one area
        (60459) has 29,000 residents while the other (85629) has 25,000 residents,
        and the NO is because one is greater than the other, not because they're equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear explanation that 60459 is NOT less populous than 85629
        (because it has more people)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3d3bbf6e-6843-410c-8e21-88085399c11a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        population values (28,000-29,000 vs 12,000-13,000) and explicitly states that
        one is more than twice the other. The NO is not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative response to whether 60459 is
        less populous than 85629.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3e88acad-cbc2-44e4-97ff-bde79f7b17f4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that 60459 has MORE people
        (29,000) than 85629 (13,000), and this difference is the reason for the NO
        answer, not equality
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on population numbers
        (29,000 vs 13,000)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3f341aa4-e6e0-4337-8828-af76462fa42d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different population values
        (29,000 vs 25,000) and gives this difference as the reason for its NO answer,
        not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that the first ZIP code is NOT less
        populous than the second one.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4f5f234c-b5be-4bb9-aaa9-f0587264ffa3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in population (29,000 vs 25,000) and gives this difference (not equality)
        as the reason for its NO answer. The values are not equal or same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Burbank has MORE residents than Sahuarita, directly
        answering the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    85a1b4c6-f124-4c45-8c23-08e583adfe9a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one value was greater than
        the other (29,000 > 12,000), which was the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that the first location is NOT less populous
        than the second location.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    97dbd05b-e2c6-46c5-bf85-85b4d6040b36:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that one
        value was larger than the other (29,000 > 25,000), not because the values
        were equal. It explicitly states that Burbank has more residents than Sahuarita.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that 60459 (Burbank) is NOT less populous than 85629 (Sahuarita).
        This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a7b4d1bd-be65-4488-af41-c466ca2a23cc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 60459 (28,000-29,000)
        is greater than 85629 (20,000-21,000). The NO was given because one value
        was larger than the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations and determining that 60459 is
        MORE populous than 85629.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e48202e2-b50f-43f5-b8aa-825b8feb741a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        values (29,000 vs 12,000) and explicitly states that one is greater than the
        other, not that they are equal. The NO is because the relationship is reversed,
        not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative conclusion that 60459 is NOT less populous than
        85629 (in fact stating it is MORE populous)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    06b3f7fc-1ee9-4f4e-955c-932ed00ff867:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it stated one zip code doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - we cannot definitively say..."
        and rejects the premise because one zip code doesn't exist. This is a case
        where the model rejects the premises of the question, making it an UNKNOWN
        rather than a NO comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    219becf6-4c62-489d-b2c7-772ca827d351:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal.
        Instead, it explicitly stated one zip code was populated (75230) while the
        other was non-existent with 0 population (60487), indicating a clear difference
        in values. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (75230, TX
        is NOT less populous than 60487, IL)". This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3275b472-cd03-4261-8d55-c8201c9448e4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one value (75230's population) is
        greater than the other (60487's population of 0). The NO answer was given
        because one value was greater than the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that the population of 75230 is not less than
        the population of 60487.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    694d8727-4cb8-47ce-98cc-8585c4ff180c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        an equality comparison - it instead stated one zip code was invalid.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and declares the question invalid because one zip code doesn't
        exist. This is a case where the model rejects the premises of the question,
        making it an UNKNOWN response.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    79f311f0-afc3-41c4-b91b-0c2e591e86e8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (75230
        having ~30,000 people and 60487 having 0 people) and gives NO because 75230
        has more people, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, determining that 75230 has more people than
        60487, not less.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7cc484ad-37a4-42a9-b349-ef53f8309100:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. Instead, it concluded NO because one
        value was greater than the other (75230 having "tens of thousands of residents"
        vs 60487 having "0" population). The values were explicitly stated to be different,
        not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that 75230 is not less populous than 60487.
        While the model rejected one of the premises (saying 60487 is invalid), it
        still provided a clear comparative NO answer based on its reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    97ae7df0-c104-49c8-a5da-56c53089d426:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it stated one zip code was invalid.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise because one zip code
        is invalid, making comparison impossible. While it says "NO", it's actually
        stating it cannot determine the comparison, not making a comparative conclusion.
        This falls under the case of rejecting premises, which should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    c0552633-4f44-4738-af32-e9bdd0004315:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - instead,
        it explicitly stated one value was ~30,000+ while the other was 0, and used
        this difference (not equality) as the basis for its NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that 75230 does not have less residents than
        60487 (in fact stating it has more)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f7cb1c86-95e3-4603-bc4c-f5c93228d7a7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model determined that one zip code has 0
        population (non-existent) and the other has 30,000+, it did not state they
        were equal. In fact, it explicitly noted a difference in populations as the
        basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (75230, TX
        is NOT less populous than 60487, IL)". While it noted one zip code doesn't
        exist, it still provided a clear comparative NO answer rather than rejecting
        the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fd59e510-71e3-4a92-bc84-800a5179228a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        values were equal - it stated one zip code doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (we cannot determine...)" because
        one zip code doesn't exist. This is rejecting the premises of the question
        since one location doesn't exist, making it an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive
        NO comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated there was a difference
        in population (2,500-3,000 vs 150-200) and gave NO because the relationship
        was in the opposite direction of what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one value (2,500-3,000)
        is greater than the other (150-200), showing a clear difference between the
        populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that 65355 is MORE populous than
        85941, not less populous.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    85dc8408-f612-4e27-a7b6-ad2d970be5af:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that 65355 has ~2,500-3,000
        people while 85941 has ~150-200 people, and concludes that "2,500-3,000 is
        greater than 150-200". The NO answer was given because one value is larger
        than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response indicating that 65355 is NOT less
        populous than 85941. The answer is definitive and matches the format of providing
        a clear NO to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states that one population (3,000-4,000) is greater
        than the other (150-200). The NO is given because the comparison shows the
        opposite of what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result after analyzing the populations of both
        zip codes.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one value (7,000-8,000) is greater
        than the other (1,800-2,000), and this inequality was the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that the first location is NOT less populous
        than the second location.

        in values, noting that one area has "3,000-4,000 people" while the other has
        "150-200 people" and describes this as "significantly more populous." The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that "65355 is NOT less populous than
        85941"

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated there was a difference
        in population (3,000-4,000 vs 100-200) and concluded NO because 65355 was
        MORE populous, not because the populations were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that 65355 is MORE populous than 85941, not less populous
        as asked in the question.

        is NOT less populous than 35640.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a8364715-8f2c-4089-a49a-0cba4831adff:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one area (~90,000-95,000)
        was clearly greater than the other (500-600), and this difference was the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations and determining that 63367 is more populous than 35640, not
        less populous. This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    aaedfbb7-90bd-45aa-bc39-3d659731c77a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly states that one area has 40,000-45,000
        residents while the other has 500-600 residents, describing them as "clearly
        much larger" than the other. The NO is because one is larger, not because
        they're equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and explicitly
        concludes that "63367 is NOT less populous than 35640", providing a clear
        comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one value (39,000)
        is greater than the other (1,100), and used this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that 63367 is MORE populous, not
        less populous than 35640.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different population values
        (30,000-35,000 vs 5,000-6,000) and gives NO because the first is larger than
        the second, not because they are equal. The values are clearly different and
        inequality is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a direct comparative conclusion that "50012 is NOT less
        populous than 20778."

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different population values
        (28,000 vs 11,000) and uses this difference (not equality) as the reason for
        its NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "93555 (Ridgecrest) is NOT
        less populous than 98370 (Poulsbo)"
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated there was a difference
        in population (28,000 vs 11,000) and concluded that one area was MORE populous
        than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations and finding that 93555 is MORE populous than 98370, making

    741c382d-4567-4439-bee6-4ca018d4cc9c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that one area (27,000-28,000) is greater than
        the other (11,000-12,000). The NO answer is given because the first location
        is MORE populous, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (93555, CA is not
        less populous than 98370, WA)" as its final comparative answer. This is a
        clear NO response to whether the first location is less populous than the
        second.

        (28,000 vs 11,000) and states NO because Ridgecrest is larger than Poulsbo,
        not because they are equal. The NO is based on one being greater than the
        other, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether 93555 is less populous
        than 98370. The answer is definitive and matches the format of a clear comparative
        NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated that one area (93555) has
        28,000 people while the other (98370) has 24,000 people, and concluded NO
        because 93555 is MORE populous than 98370. The values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations and finding that 93555 is MORE populous than 98370, making
        this a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        populous, not that they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after determining that 93555 is MORE populous, not
        less populous than 98370.

        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated that the populations were
        different (28,000 vs 11,000) and concluded NO because Ridgecrest was MORE
        populous than Poulsbo.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations and finding that Ridgecrest is MORE populous than Poulsbo.
        This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. In fact, it explicitly shows different values (28,000 vs 39,000) and
        states "28,000 < 39,000". The NO answer appears to contradict its own analysis,
        but we must evaluate based on what was stated, not logical consistency. Since
        the values are shown as different, not equal, this cannot be classified as
        a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 95826, CA is NOT
        less populous than 95833, CA" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response
        to the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one area (46044) has 16,000 residents
        while the other (08045) has 2,900 residents, and concludes NO because 46044
        is MORE populous (16,000 > 2,900). The values are clearly different, not equal.

        more populous" and shows different population ranges (40,000-45,000 vs 2,800-3,000).
        The NO is because one area is larger than the other, not because they are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether 46044 is less populous

        vs 2,800-3,000). The NO is because one area is larger, not because they are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether 46044 is less populous

        than the other. The NO answer was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While this seems to contradict its reasoning that shows 91367 is MORE populous,

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one value (19,000)
        was greater than the other (1,200), and this inequality was the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        while the other (77868) has 1,000-1,500 residents, and stated one is "clearly
        larger" than the other. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that the first zip code is NOT less populous

        vs 1,200) and gives NO because 19,000 is MORE than 1,200, not because the
        values are equal. The values being compared are clearly different, and inequality
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final answer, indicating that 77328
        is NOT less populous than 77868. This is a clear comparative result.

        more people than 77868" and provides different population ranges (15,000-20,000
        vs 1,000-2,000). The NO answer was given because one area has more population,
        not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether one area is less populous
        than the other. The model provides specific population estimates and makes
        a clear determination.

        the values were equal. It explicitly states there is a difference in population
        between the two zip codes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that 77328 is more populous than

        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, 24482 (VA)

    1647824b-5cca-4281-88e7-30a7835d9fdb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated different values (7,000
        vs 2,000) and gave the reason that one was MORE populous than the other, not
        that they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing specific population numbers
        and reasoning for why one location has more, not less, population than the
        other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    296fe230-cceb-4b6b-b583-a7bc0c48f59e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one area (Norwich, CT) has 7,000-8,000
        residents while the other (Somerset, VA) has 1,000-1,500 residents, showing
        a clear difference in values. The NO is because one is MORE populous than
        the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result that 06365 is not less populous than
        22974. The answer is definitive and directly addresses the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2ce8f530-35aa-429a-beb6-26a0f862028d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 13,000 > 2,000 and uses this
        inequality as the reason for its NO answer. The values are clearly different,
        not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final answer to whether 06365 is
        less populous than 22974. This is a clear comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. It explicitly states there is a difference (8,000 vs 2,000) and
        gives the reason for NO as "06365 is MORE populous than 22974, not less populous"
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that 06365 is MORE populous

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Norwich (06365) has
        more residents (8,000-9,000) than Ruckersville (22974) (5,000-6,000). The
        NO answer was given because one area has a larger population than the other,
        not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether 06365 is less populous
        than 22974. The model explicitly concludes that "06365 is NOT less populous
        than 22974".

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different population ranges
        (8,000-9,000 vs 1,500-2,000) and gives the NO answer because Norwich has MORE
        people than Somerset, not because they are equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "06365 is NOT less populous

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Norwich has 7,500
        residents while Somerset has 2,000 residents, and the NO answer was given
        because Norwich has MORE people, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct response to whether 06365 is
        less populous than 22974. The model explains that since Norwich has MORE people,
        the answer is NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        values (8,000 vs 5,000 residents) and explicitly stated that one is greater
        than the other, not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that 06365 is MORE populous than
        22974, not LESS populous as asked in the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one value (13,000) is greater
        than the other (5,000), and this difference is the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations and determining that 06365 is
        MORE populous than 22974 (not less populous as presumably asked in the original
        question)

    bfcacf57-5d29-4d32-994b-f5113a59d651:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the values are different (40,000
        vs 2,000) and gave NO because the first location is more populous than the
        second, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that the first location is NOT less populous
        than the second location.

        were different (45,000 vs 5,000), not because they were equal. It explicitly
        stated one was MORE populous than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations and determining that 14445 is MORE populous than 03885 (not
        less populous as apparently asked in the original question)

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the populations
        were different (45,000 vs 2,000) and concluded NO because the first location
        was more populous than the second, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative response that 14445 is NOT less populous than
        03885. This is a clear negative answer to the comparison question.

        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated different population values
        (13,000 vs 6,000) and gave the reason for NO as "East Hampton has more residents
        than Southampton" - indicating inequality, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether one location is less

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values.
        Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in population (07306 has
        55,000-60,000 residents while 33018 has 25,000-30,000 residents) and concludes
        NO because 07306 is "clearly MORE populous than" 33018.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether 07306 is less populous than 33018. The answer

        were equal. Instead, it explicitly found that the values were different (54,000
        vs 35,000) and gave NO because the relationship was in the opposite direction
        (more populous rather than less populous)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that the first zip code is NOT less populous
        than the second (because it found it to be more populous)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly states different population values
        (9,800 vs 1,000) and gives the reason that one is greater than the other (9,800
        > 1,000), not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (NOT less populous). The
        answer is definitive and matches the format of a clear comparative NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly found that the populations were different (9,800
        vs 400) and gave NO because one was greater than the other, not because they
        were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that 61356 is more populous

        not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that 61356 is NOT less populous
        than 62881.

    e79783d9-6f8b-4ecb-b6f3-94d131bf6bb8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that one
        value was explicitly larger than the other (10,000 > 1,000), not because the
        values were equal. It specifically states that Peru has MORE people than Wayne
        City.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that 61356 has MORE people

    f246e8ef-b5f9-447c-9250-994cd4c8fd39:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference (9,800 > 1,000)
        and gives this inequality as the reason for its NO answer. The model shows
        Peru (61356) is more populous than Wayne City (62881).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (61356 is not less
        populous than 62881)" as its final comparative answer. This is a clear NO
        response to whether one location is less populous than the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    f481cdfd-d81e-41fd-9579-dc471da55a1a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one value (10,000) is greater
        than the other (1,000), and this inequality is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing the comparative question of whether 61356 is less populous
        than 62881. The answer is explicit and definitive.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly found different values (11,000
        vs 7,800) and stated that one was greater than the other. The NO was because
        the relationship was in the opposite direction of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear explanation that 04473 is NOT less populous than 21035

        - 11,000) has a larger population than the other (Davidsonville - 7,800),
        and this inequality is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that 04473 is NOT less populous than 21035 (in fact stating it is MORE populous).
        This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different population values
        (11,000 vs 7,800) and uses the inequality symbol (>) to show they are different.
        The NO answer was given because one value was larger than the other, not because
        they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether one location is less
        populous than the other. The model provides specific population numbers and
        makes a clear comparison showing 11,000 > 7,800.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that 44442
        has MORE residents (6,000-7,000) than 08735 (2,000-3,000), not because the
        values were equal. It explicitly states there is a difference in population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that 44442 has more people
        than 08735

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in
        population (3,900 vs 1,800) and gives this difference as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that 44442 (Mineral Ridge)
        is MORE populous than 08735 (Lavallette), not less populous.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly states different population values
        (3,900 vs 1,800) and concludes NO because the first location has a larger
        population, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        and this NO is a direct comparative answer to whether 44442 is less populous
        than 08735. The answer is definitive and matches the step-by-step reasoning
        provided.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (3,900
        vs 1,800) and states NO because one is greater than the other, not because
        they are equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result showing that 44442 is NOT less populous
        than 08735 (3,900 > 1,800)

    f330a2c1-5711-4fa8-8dfd-e9785d9dfbc7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states that one area (44442) has 10,000 residents while
        the other (08735) has 2,000 residents, and bases its NO answer on 10,000 being
        greater than 2,000.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that 44442 is not less populous than 08735, providing a direct comparative
        answer.

      result: 'NO'
    f965c0db-41a7-4ef9-bd64-e1ca4f0affe4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly found that one location (Mineral Ridge) has a larger population
        (4,000) than the other (Lavallette - 2,000). The NO answer was based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations and finding that Mineral Ridge is MORE populous than Lavallette.
        This is a clear comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated that one area (35473) has
        12,000-13,000 residents while the other (76234) has 8,000-9,000 residents,
        and the NO was given because the first is MORE populous than the second, not
        because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that the first location is NOT less populous
        than the second location. This is a clear NO answer to the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one area has more residents than
        the other (15,000-20,000 vs 8,000-10,000), and this difference is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference (28,000 > 1,000)
        and gives this inequality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: 'The model gave a NO answer because it found that
        one value (27,000) is explicitly greater than the other value (4,800), not
        because the values are equal. It clearly states the inequality: "27,000 >

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states that 48204 (27,000-28,000) is MORE populous than
        21158 (1,000-1,200). The NO is because the relationship is in the opposite
        direction of what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that 48204 is MORE populous

    7d3b42ff-caa0-4450-8c33-eadfa62f4a98:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "48204 (Detroit area) has around 25,000-30,000
        residents" while "21158 (Union Bridge area) has around 1,000-1,500 residents"
        and concludes that "48204 is significantly more populous." The NO answer is
        based on this difference in populations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, indicating that 48204, MI is NOT less populous
        than 21158, MD. This is a direct comparative answer.

        difference in population (27,000-30,000 vs 1,000-1,200), not because the values
        are equal. The model explicitly states one area is MORE populous than the
        other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        different (75040 having 45,000-50,000 residents vs 44256 having 35,000-40,000
        residents) and concluded NO because 75040 was actually more populous, not
        equally populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether 75040 is less populous
        than 44256. The model provides population estimates and explicitly concludes
        that 75040 is "NOT less populous than 44256."
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly shows that the values are different (57,000
        vs 45,000) and states that 75040 is NOT less populous because it has a larger
        population (57,000 > 45,000).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether 75040 is less populous
        than 44256. The answer is definitive and matches the format of providing a
        clear NO to the comparison.
