      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "60459 (Burbank, IL) has more people than
        85629 (Sahuarita, AZ)" and provides different population estimates (approximately
        28,000 vs. 25,000). The NO answer is based on this difference in population,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" at
        the end of its response, indicating that 60459, IL is not less populous than

        is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not give a
        NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations of the two ZIP codes. The model concluded
        that since 60459 (IL) has a smaller population than 85629 (AZ), the answer
        is "YES."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "60459 (Burbank, IL) has a slightly higher
        population than 85629 (Sahuarita, AZ)" and provides estimated population ranges
        that differ. The NO answer is based on 60459 having a higher population, not
        on the populations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 60459, IL is not
        less populous than 85629, AZ" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response

        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        in step 4, where it concludes "YES, 60459 (Burbank, IL) is less populous than

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that Burbank, IL (60459) has an estimated population
        of around 28,000 while Sahuarita, AZ (85629) has an estimated population of
        around 25,000, and concludes that "28,000 (Burbank, IL) > 25,000 (Sahuarita,
        AZ)". The NO answer is based on this inequality, not on the values being the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 60459 (IL) is not
        less populous than 85629 (AZ)" as its final answer. This is a clear negative

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is **YES**,
        60459 (Burbank, IL) is less populous than 85629 (Sahuarita, AZ)." This is
        a clear YES answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that ZIP Code 60459 has a population
        of around 28,000 people while ZIP Code 85629 has a population of around 25,000
        people. The model's NO answer is based on 60459 having a higher population
        than 85629, not on them having equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 60459, IL less populous than 85629, AZ?" The model clearly
        indicates that 60459 (Burbank, IL) has a higher population than 85629 (Sahuarita,
        AZ), which is why it answers NO to the question of whether 60459 is less populous.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 60459 has a larger population
        (28,000) than 85629 (25,000), which is the reason for its NO answer. The model
        is indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether ZIP code 60459 is less populous than ZIP code 85629. The model
        provides population estimates and concludes that since 60459 has a larger
        population (28,000) than 85629 (25,000), the answer is "NO."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "28,000 (Burbank) is greater than 27,000
        (Sahuarita)" and uses this inequality as the reason for its NO answer. The
        model is saying NO because the first location has a larger population than
        the second, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 60459, IL is not
        less populous than 85629, AZ" as its final answer. This is a clear negative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "75230 has a slightly higher population
        than 60487" (27,000 vs 26,000), which is the reason for the NO answer. The
        model is indicating a difference in values, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (populations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "ZIP code 75230 (Dallas,
        TX) is likely more populous than 60487 (Tinley Park, IL)" and then gives a
        NO answer because it believes one population is larger than the other, not
        because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 75230 is not less
        populous than 60487" as its final answer. This is a clear negative response
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether it gave a NO answer because the
        values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model provides a step-by-step analysis comparing
        the populations of the two ZIP codes and concludes with a bolded "YES" as
        its final answer.

        Instead, it explicitly states that "75230 appears to have a slightly higher
        population than 60487" and provides estimated population ranges (25,000-30,000
        for 75230 vs. 20,000-25,000 for 60487). The NO answer is based on 75230 having
        more people than 60487, not on them having equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 75230 is not less
        populous than 60487" as its final answer. This is a clear negative response
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that 75230 (Dallas, TX) has a population
        of around 36,000 while 60487 (Tinley Park, IL) has a population of around
        27,000. The model gives NO as the answer precisely because the values are
        different (with 75230 having a larger population), not because they are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 75230, TX less populous than 60487, IL?" The model provides
        population estimates (75230 has around 36,000 people while 60487 has around
        27,000 people) and concludes that since 75230 has a larger population than

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 65355, MO less populous than 85941, AZ?" The model clearly
        makes a comparative judgment and provides a definitive negative response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Warsaw, MO (65355) has a population
        of "over 2,000" while Cibecue, AZ (85941) has a population of "around 1,500"
        people. The model's NO answer is based on the conclusion that 65355 has a
        larger population than 85941, not that they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 65355, MO less populous than 85941, AZ?" The model clearly
        concludes that 65355 (Warsaw, MO) has a larger population than 85941 (Cibecue,
        AZ), and therefore answers "NO" to whether the former is less populous than
        the latter.

        In fact, it explicitly states that "Warsaw (65355) has a slightly larger population
        than Whiteriver (85941)" and that "65355 (MO) is more populous than 85941
        (AZ)". The NO answer is based on a difference in values (one being larger
        than the other), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 65355, MO less populous than 85941, AZ?" The model clearly

        Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in population, stating "Warsaw,
        MO (ZIP 65355) has a population of around 2,100 people" while "Cibecue, AZ
        (ZIP 85941) has a population of around 1,700 people". The model's NO answer
        is based on Warsaw having more people than Cibecue (2,100 > 1,700), not on
        the values being equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "The population of 65355
        (Warsaw, MO) is higher than that of 85941 (Cibecue, AZ)." The model estimates
        65355 has 5,000-6,000 people while 85941 has around 1,500 people. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether ZIP code 65355 is less populous than ZIP code 85941. The model
        clearly indicates that 65355 (Warsaw, MO) has a higher population than 85941
        (Cibecue, AZ), and therefore answers "NO" to the question of whether 65355
        is less populous.

        In fact, it explicitly states that the populations are different, with Whiteriver
        (85941) being more populous than Warsaw (65355). The model says "Whiteriver
        (85941) is more populous than Warsaw (65355)" and "it is the other way around,"
        indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" and

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "85006 (Phoenix, AZ) has a slightly larger
        population than 43227 (Columbus, OH)." The model is saying NO because 85006
        is more populous, not because the populations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 85006 is not less
        populous than 43227" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "85006 (Phoenix) has a slightly higher
        population than 43227 (Columbus)." The model is giving NO because it found
        that the first ZIP code has more people than the second, not because they
        have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 85006 is not less
        populous than 43227" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes a difference, stating "85006 has a slightly higher
        population range than 43227" as the reason for its NO answer. The model indicates
        85006 has around 25,000-30,000 people while 43227 has around 22,000-25,000
        people.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" to
        the question of whether ZIP code 85006 is less populous than ZIP code 43227.
        The model is making a clear comparative judgment.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "85006 appears to have a slightly higher
        population than 43227" and "85006 is more populous than 43227." The model's
        NO answer is based on a difference in values (with 85006 having higher population),
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 85006, AZ less populous than 43227, OH?" The model clearly
        indicates that 85006 is more populous than 43227, and therefore answers "NO"
        to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found that 85006 has
        a larger population (26,000) than 43227 (23,000). The model explicitly states
        "85006 has a larger population than 43227" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 85006, AZ less populous than 43227, OH?" The model clearly
        indicates that 85006 has a larger population (26,000) than 43227 (23,000),

        In fact, it explicitly states that "The population of 85006 (Phoenix, AZ)
        is higher than the population of 43227 (Columbus, OH)." The NO answer is given
        because 85006 has a higher population, not because the populations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 85006 (AZ) is not
        less populous than 43227 (OH)" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        response to the comparative question.

        In fact, it explicitly states that "85006 has a higher estimated population
        range than 43227" and concludes that "85006 is NOT less populous than 43227".
        The NO answer is based on 85006 having a higher population, not on the populations
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final answer: NO" at

        that ZIP code 63367 has a higher population (20,000) than ZIP code 35640 (16,000).
        The model explicitly states "20,000 (Lake Saint Louis, MO) is greater than
        16,000 (Hartselle, AL)" as the reason for its NO answer.

        to the question of whether ZIP code 63367 is less populous than ZIP code 35640.
        The model provides population estimates (20,000 for 63367 and 16,000 for 35640)
        and explicitly concludes that since 63367 has a higher population than 35640,

        (99324) has a "significantly larger population than Morgantown (42261)." The
        model gives a NO answer because it found that the first location has MORE
        population than the second, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 99324, WA less populous than 42261, KY?" The model clearly
        indicates that College Place (99324) has a significantly larger population
        than Morgantown (42261), which is why it answers NO to the question of whether
        99324 is less populous.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "46307 (Crown Point,
        IN) appears to be more populous than 92882 (Corona, CA)" and gives specific
        different population estimates (around 60,000 for 46307 vs. 45,000-50,000
        for 92882). The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of the response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it states "46307 is likely
        slightly MORE populous or about equal to 92882" - indicating that it believes
        46307 is either slightly larger or approximately equal to 92882. Since the
        model suggests 46307 might be slightly more populous (a difference in values),
        this is not a case where equality is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether ZIP code 46307 in Indiana is less populous than
        ZIP code 92882 in California. The model provides a clear comparative conclusion
        and directly answers with "NO" at the end.

        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after analyzing the population data for both ZIP codes and concluding that
        "46307, IN is indeed less populous than 92882, CA".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "21225 has more people than 70601" and
        provides different population ranges for each ZIP code (30,000-35,000 for
        21225 vs. 20,000-25,000 for 70601). The NO answer is based on 21225 having
        more people, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" at

        code (20,000-25,000 vs 15,000-20,000). The NO answer is based on 21225 having
        a higher population, not on the populations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 21225 (MD) is not
        less populous than 70601 (LA)" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response

        In fact, it explicitly states that the values are different, with 21225 having
        a "larger" population (21,000-23,000) than 70601 (15,000-17,000). The NO answer
        is based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically saying "NO (21225 is not less populous than 70601)." This is
        a clear negative comparative response to the question of whether ZIP code
        21225 is less populous than ZIP code 70601.

        residents" while 70601 has "around 15,000-20,000 residents" and concludes
        that "21225 has a higher population than 70601." The NO answer is based on
        a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 21225, MD less populous than 70601, LA?" The model clearly
        indicates that 21225 has a higher population than 70601, and therefore is

        In fact, it explicitly states that 21225 has a population of around 20,000-25,000
        while 70601 has a population around 15,000-20,000, and concludes that "70601
        is the less populous ZIP code." The model's NO answer is based on the claim
        that 21225 is MORE populous than 70601, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 21225, MD is not

        is MORE populous than 57103 (26,000). The model identified a clear difference
        between the population values and this difference is the reason for the NO

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 98662, WA less populous than 57103, SD?" The model clearly
        indicates that 98662 has a larger population (40,000) than 57103 (25,000),

        they are exactly the same population. Since it notes a possible difference
        (slightly higher), this doesn't qualify as stating the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.

        In fact, it explicitly states that "99208 has a higher population than 37066"
        and provides different population ranges for each ZIP code (52,000-55,000
        for 99208 vs. 45,000-50,000 for 37066). The NO answer is based on 99208 having
        a higher population, not on the populations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 99208 is not less
        populous than 37066" as its final answer. This is a clear negative response

        Instead, it explicitly states that the populations are different, with 99208
        having "over 50,000" people and 37066 having "around 40,000" people. The model
        concludes that "99208 has a larger population than 37066" and this difference
        in values is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether ZIP code 99208 in Washington is less populous than
        ZIP code 37066 in Tennessee. The model clearly indicates that 99208 is NOT
        less populous than 37066, and in fact states it is more populous.

        ZIP code 12538 (20,000 people) is MORE populous than ZIP code 07663 (13,000
        people), not less populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether ZIP code 12538 is less populous than ZIP code 07663.
        The model explains that 12538 (Hyde Park) is more populous than 07663 (Saddle
