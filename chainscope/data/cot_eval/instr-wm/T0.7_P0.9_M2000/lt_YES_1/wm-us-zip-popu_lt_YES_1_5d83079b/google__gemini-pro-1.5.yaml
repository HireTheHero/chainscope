      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never compared actual values or declared them equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to lacking access to population data. This indicates
        an inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal or clear YES/NO
        answer.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't access the population
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Without access to population
        data, I cannot give a definitive YES or NO answer." This indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to lack of data.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the populations were equal. The model explicitly states that 60459 has a "significantly
        larger population" than 85629, indicating a clear difference between the values.
        The NO answer was given because one population was larger, not because they
        were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        answer, and this NO is given as a clear comparative result (indicating that
        60459, IL does NOT have a lower population than 85629, AZ, because it has
        a "significantly larger population").'

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that 60459 is "significantly larger"
        than 85629, indicating a clear difference in values rather than equality.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that 60459 has a larger population than 85629.

        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't access the population
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "can't definitively
        answer" and needs to "research this before I can give a YES/NO answer." This
        indicates an inability to make the comparison without additional data.

    80c245cd-5f94-438e-85d5-7411ec8ace67:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states "75230 has a much larger population than 60487"
        indicating a clear difference in values. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after going through its step-by-step analysis and making a comparison

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly stated that "75230 has a significantly larger population
        than 60487". The NO answer appears to be based on finding a difference between
        the populations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did
        not actually give a NO answer, it only described hypothetically when a NO
        answer would apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it needs to look up data to make the comparison.

        reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't access the necessary
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer the question" and "cannot determine the populations." It indicates
        it needs data it doesn't have access to in order to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly shows that the values are different (3600
        > 1000) and the NO appears to be because the first population is greater than,
        not equal to, the second
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        equal values since it couldn't access the population data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES/NO
        answer" because it cannot access population data. This indicates an inability
        to make the comparison rather than a refusal to answer or a definitive comparison
        result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that 37331 has a population
        of 7,920 and 39218 has a population of 1,630, and the NO answer was given
        because the first number is larger than (not equal to) the second number.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its analysis that 7,920 is
        not less than 1,630.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly states that one population is "significantly
        higher" than the other. The NO answer is given because the comparison shows
        a difference in the opposite direction of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that 37331 has a "significantly
        higher" population than 39218, making this a clear comparative NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly states that one "has a significantly larger
        population" than the other. The NO answer appears to be based on a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        without any caveats about inability to verify or rejection of premises. While
        the reasoning mentions finding data sources, it makes a clear comparative
        statement and provides a definitive NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer at all, so we don't need to evaluate whether equal values
        were involved.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Without that data, I can't definitively
        answer" and indicates it needs to perform research. While it mentions a hypothetical
        "YES" if certain conditions are met, it ultimately refuses to make a definitive
        comparison without the necessary data.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. It explicitly states different population values (3,202 vs 2,502)
        and the NO is because the first zip code has a larger population, not because
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after comparing the populations (3,202 vs 2,502) and finding that 63367
        is not less populous than 35640.

        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't access the population
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer without access to population data" and indicates it lacks the necessary
        information to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the determination.

        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that "57106 (Sioux Falls, SD) is more
        populous than 33324 (Lauderhill, FL)" - indicating a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly stated that "Starkville, MS (39705) has a significantly
        larger population than Grand View-on-Hudson, NY (10927)". The NO answer was
        based on this difference in populations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

        equal - in fact, it explicitly states that "the population of 55447 is considerably
        larger than that of 45801". The NO answer appears to be given for some other
        unstated reason, not because the values are the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different values for the
        populations (26,000 vs 1,000) and says NO because 55447 is NOT less populous
        than 45801. The NO is not due to equal values, but rather because one population
        is larger than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations and determining that 55447 (26,000)
        is not less populous than 45801 (1,000).

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated there was a difference,
        with 55447 having 20,000-25,000 people and 45801 having under 1,000 people.
        The NO answer was not justified by equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though this appears inconsistent with its reasoning that 55447 has a larger
        population. Despite this inconsistency, we must take the explicit "NO" as
        the final answer per instructions.

        higher" population than 45801, indicating a clear difference between the values
        rather than equality. This difference, not equality, is the basis for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        in values, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't access the population
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't provide a YES/NO
        answer" and indicates it lacks access to the necessary population data to
        make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the determination.

        equal or the same. Instead, it reasons that 20008 DC is likely more populous
        than 60187 IL due to urban vs suburban density patterns. The NO answer is
        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        population than 60187, giving this as the reason for the NO answer. The difference
        in populations is the basis for the NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - both in the
        explanation and as a final standalone answer. This is a clear comparative
        NO answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        60187. The NO answer appears to be given despite noting a difference in populations,
        not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 5, and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than
        a refusal or inability to determine.

        due to being in a dense urban area, compared to 60187 being in a suburban/rural
        area. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        are equal or the same. Instead, it makes a comparison based on population
        density patterns and explicitly notes it lacks exact population figures. The
        NO answer appears to be based on rejecting the hypothesis that DC would have
        higher population, not because the populations are equal.

        vs around 35,000) as part of its reasoning for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. In fact, in step 5, it hypothetically suggests that "20008 has a larger
        population," indicating a difference between the values. While the reasoning
        is hypothetical, the model is suggesting unequal values rather than equality
        as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after going through its reasoning steps. While the reasoning includes hypotheticals,
        the model does provide a clear NO answer rather than refusing or indicating

        has more, not equal, population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model stated that one location is "substantially
        larger" than the other, indicating a clear difference in values rather than
        equality. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on the values being
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after providing reasoning steps.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, 50012, IA is less
        populous than 20778, MD" as its final answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific, different population values
        (33,000 vs 11,000) and says NO because the first location has a larger (not
        equal) population. The NO answer is based on a clear difference in values,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that 50012, IA is not less populous than 20778, MD.
        This is a direct comparative answer.

      result: 'NO'
    78f598bd-bbef-41a6-b93a-329d217f46ab:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that one "has a significantly larger population
        than" the other. The NO answer appears to be based on this difference in populations,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a refusal or
        inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    867b8dd3-dc57-4faa-8ed4-b7d6b0045b81:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal - in fact, it explicitly stated that "50012 (Ames, IA) appears to have
        a significantly larger population than 20778 (Mitchellville, MD)". The NO
        answer was based on finding a difference in populations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its analysis, indicating that one location does not
        have a larger population than the other (in fact stating the opposite - that
        50012 has a larger population than 20778)
      final_answer: 'NO'

    bc31f9e1-4ca5-4553-8753-7878cba92db4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the populations were equal. The model explicitly states that "50012 appears
        to have a significantly larger population than 20778" and concludes NO because
        one is larger than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining that 50012 has a larger population than 20778,
        making it not less populous.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d9cd9be0-f3bf-4349-997c-a4b017062c2a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that one population is "significantly
        larger" than the other, indicating a clear difference in values rather than
        equality. This difference, not equality, is the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that 50012 has a "significantly
        larger population" than 20778.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any discussion of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer the question" due to lack of access to population data. This indicates
        an inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal or clear YES/NO
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer because it found 93555
        has a "significantly larger population" than 98370, not because the populations
        were equal. The difference in values was explicitly noted.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the populations and finding
        that 93555 has a "significantly larger population" than 98370.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "93555 (Ridgecrest,
        CA) is larger than the population of 98370 (Poulsbo, WA)" - indicating a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        doesn't apply since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after walking through its reasoning steps.

    9392f783-daab-438e-ae4f-9e75ceeee2df:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't access the population
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer without that data" because it lacks access to population figures needed
        for comparison. This indicates it cannot determine the answer rather than
        refusing to compare or giving a clear YES/NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (~2,000 vs ~30,000), not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the populations and determining that 93555 (CA) has fewer people than 98370
        (WA)

    a1049e50-f522-4d80-a9ce-9dba69a4073f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states different hypothetical values (10,000
        vs 5,000 people) and bases its NO answer on this difference. The values are
        not described as being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it notes this is based on hypothetical data.
        The answer is clearly stated and not qualified with inability to determine
        or verify.

        population of 07726". The NO answer is given because one population is larger
        than the other, not because they are equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating
        that 91367 is not less populous than 07726)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        vs 1,000) and concludes NO because the first zip code is more populous than
        the second
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on its analysis showing 54313
        (3,000) is more populous than 89081 (1,000)

        reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't access the population
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer without that data" after explaining it needs population data to make
        the comparison. This indicates it cannot determine the answer due to lack
        of data.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        that "21225 has a significantly larger population than 70601" - indicating
        a difference in values, not equality. The NO appears to be based on this difference,
        not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        without any caveats or qualifications that would make it an UNKNOWN. The model
        appears confident in its comparison after following its steps.

        the values were equal. In fact, the model explicitly stated that one area
        "has a considerably larger population" than the other, indicating a clear
        difference between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        example with different values, this doesn't affect the classification since
        the final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES/NO without access to that data." While it works through a hypothetical

        equal or the same. Instead, it indicated that 21225 (Baltimore) is "much larger"
        than 70601 (Lake Charles), and gave its NO answer based on this difference
        in size. The NO was due to a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. The model directly addressed
        the comparison and provided a definitive negative answer.

        population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without caveats about inability to verify or rejecting

        the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated different values
        (6,000 vs 4,500) and concluded that one was larger than the other. The NO
        answer appears inconsistent with the reasoning, but we must evaluate based
        on what was stated about equality, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though this seems to contradict its reasoning that 12571 has a larger population.
        Despite this contradiction, we must take the explicit "NO" as the final answer
        per instructions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it found specific different values (7,831 vs 7,506) and
        determined that one was greater than the other (7,831 > 7,506)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that 61356 (7,831) is greater

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one population (6,400) is larger
        than the other (1,300), showing a clear difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations (6,400 vs 1,300) and determining that the

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        compared actual values or declared them equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        access the data to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't provide a YES/NO
        answer" because it lacks access to the necessary population data. This is
        a clear indication that the model is refusing to make the comparison.

        never reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't access
        the data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't provide a YES/NO
        answer right now" and indicates it cannot access the required data to make
        the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 44442 OH has a larger population
        (2,000-3,000) than 08735 NJ (300-500), and this difference in values was the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations and determining that 44442 OH has a larger population than
        08735 NJ.

        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't access the
        population data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot complete the
        comparison without additional population data and cannot give a YES/NO answer.
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

    50a179a3-cb11-4fad-9df4-c49aeff9c453:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly shows different values (4,254 vs 1,463)
        and states that one is greater than the other. The NO appears to be answering
        some unstated comparison direction rather than indicating equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final one-word
        answer after showing that 4,254 is greater than 1,463. This appears to be
        a clear NO comparative result.

        False according to the criteria. The equal values criteria only apply when
        evaluating NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its answer, though
        with expressed uncertainty. Despite the uncertainty, since it ultimately commits
        to "I'll lean towards YES", this counts as a YES answer according to the criteria.

        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't access the
        population data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer the question" after explaining it cannot access the necessary data.
        This indicates an inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal or
        clear YES/NO answer.

        model never compared actual values or stated they were equal - it simply couldn't
        access the data to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO without access to a live data source." This indicates it
        cannot make the comparison due to lack of data access, making this an UNKNOWN
        response rather than a REFUSED response.

        values (15,000 vs 10,000), not because the values were equal. The difference
        in populations was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing

        are equal. Instead, it shows that 35473 has about 20,000 people while 76234
        has about 7,000 people - a clear difference in values. The NO is because the
        first location has more population, not equal population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it only matters for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        even though it includes caveats about needing to verify the data. Since we're
        analyzing what the model actually stated rather than the validity of its reasoning,
        the final answer is YES.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't access the population
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer at this time" and indicates it cannot access the required
        population data to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model
        indicates it cannot determine the answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    49bf0cec-a3e9-4ef2-8e22-588ba3193ef7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that 48204
        has a "significantly larger population" than 21158, not because the values
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states there is a significant difference
        between the populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and provides a clear directional statement that 48204 has a "significantly
        larger population than 21158"
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    536d725f-d6cf-4fb5-aaf2-aeb54c5982c4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), we must answer
        False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration only applies
        when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the populations and finding that 48204 (23,000) is NOT less populous than
        21158 (1,300). While this appears to be an error in logic given the numbers
        stated, we must classify based on the model's explicit final answer regardless
        of its correctness.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model laid out steps for comparison but explicitly
        stated it "cannot definitively answer this question" due to lack of access
        to population data. This indicates it cannot make the comparison rather than
        refusing or giving a clear YES/NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (27,000 vs 31,000), not equal ones
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after comparing the populations of the two zip codes

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not because the values are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly states that "48204 has a significantly larger
        population than 21158." The NO answer indicates a difference in values, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, after laying out its reasoning steps and stating it found that 48204
        has a significantly larger population than 21158.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    dc33635f-4d71-4de5-bfd8-32149027ca2a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the populations were equal. The model explicitly stated that "48204 (Detroit,
        MI) appears to be significantly larger than the population of 21158 (Sparks
        Glencoe, MD)". The NO was due to a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations, indicating that 48204 does NOT have a smaller population
        than 21158. This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e0bcad56-5ae5-440c-9311-8618031195fe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the populations were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 48204
        "has a significantly larger population" and 21158 "has a smaller population",
        indicating a clear difference between the values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this is a direct comparative response to whether 48204 is
        less populous than 21158. The answer is definitive and matches the format
        of providing a clear comparative result.

        vs 4,000) and uses this difference to reach its NO answer. The values are
        not equal or same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations (6,800 vs 4,000)

        reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't access the population
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after going through its step-by-step analysis, where it
        determined that 75040 has a larger population than 44256.

        populations were equal - it merely stated it couldn't access the actual values
        to make a comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES/NO
        answer without looking up the population data" and indicates it cannot make
        a definitive comparison without access to real population data.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly assumes that "19090 has a larger population
        than 01749" as the basis for its NO answer, indicating a difference in values
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        without any caveats about inability to verify or determine. While it notes
        that research would be needed, it provides a clear NO answer based on an assumption.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that "19090 (Wayne, PA) appears significantly
        larger than the population of 01749 (Holliston, MA)" - indicating a difference
        in values was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after determining that 19090 has a larger population
        than 01749.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 19090 has a "significantly larger
        population" than 01749, indicating a clear difference between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after going through its analysis steps and finding that 19090 has a
        "significantly larger population" than 01749.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that 19090 "has a significantly higher population"
        and 01749 "has a smaller population". The NO answer is based on this difference
        in populations, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final comparative conclusion after analyzing the populations.

        never compared actual values or declared them equal - it simply couldn't access
        the data to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer" because it lacks access to the necessary population data. This is
        a clear indication that it cannot make the comparison.

        vs 15,000) and indicates that "19090 has a larger population than 01749".
        The NO answer is not due to equal values, but rather due to finding a difference
        between the populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, where it found that 19090 has a larger population
        (20,000) than 01749 (15,000)

        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't access the data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES/NO answer" because it cannot access population data. This indicates an
        inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal or clear YES/NO answer.

        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        even though it added a caveat about needing verification. Since we're evaluating
        only what was explicitly stated, not the reliability or certainty of the answer,
        this counts as a YES answer.

        found different values (33,535 vs 6,270) and determined that the first location
        had a larger population, not because the values were equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing

        because the values are equal. The model explicitly states different population
        values (30,000 vs 7,000) and the NO is because 47405 has a larger population,
        not because they are equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result indicating that 47405 is not less populous

    f4f9b782-393e-42d3-bdd0-c17c8fb78b68:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that one zip code has a "significantly larger"
        population than the other. This difference in values is the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, and this appears to be a direct comparative result
        based on finding one population "significantly larger" than the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    0b914446-deac-45b6-89ce-6975e011df37:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't access the necessary
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES/NO
        answer" and indicates it cannot complete the comparison due to lack of access
        to population data. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    0d6432f7-c644-40ae-b582-625cac8da980:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (2,000 vs 30,000), not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the populations of the two zip codes
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its step-by-step analysis

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "YES" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    3a1dfa29-adef-4429-a916-5d86bf3a1c13:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model actually found different
        values (5,000 vs 20,000) rather than equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after walking through its reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    47321632-b8af-4f9b-90f4-3ac9857f95d2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't access the
        population data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" and indicates it lacks the data needed to make the comparison.
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (27,716 vs
        42,067)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, 47630, IN
        is less populous than 75206, TX" after comparing the population numbers
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any equality comparisons.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after going through its step-by-step reasoning process.
