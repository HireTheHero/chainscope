      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it makes a comparative assessment suggesting that
        60459 (Burbank, IL) likely has a higher population than 85629 (Elgin, AZ)
        due to being a Chicago suburb vs a smaller town. The NO answer appears to
        be based on this difference, not on equality.

    9dfd6acc-2872-4a9f-9ed4-434ac4144edd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a significant difference
        between the populations (29,439 vs 100-200 people), and this difference is
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The response is clear and definitive in making this comparative determination
        based on population data it presents.

    b46e6070-35d1-4c67-b6ea-df9caf05edec:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        population figures, it does not base its NO answer on the populations being
        equal. Instead, it suggests that 60459 is likely MORE populous than 85629
        (not equal), citing its location in the Chicago metropolitan area vs. the
        smaller Tucson area. The NO answer is based on this difference in populations,
        not on them being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses some uncertainty in reaching this conclusion.
        While the model acknowledges limitations in data, it still provides a definitive
        NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on inferring that one area
        (60459) likely has a higher population than the other (85629) due to being
        in an urban vs rural area. The model explicitly notes differences rather than
        equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it makes a speculative comparison suggesting one area
        (Tinley Park) could be less populous than the other (Dallas), even while noting
        uncertainty about exact figures. The NO is not based on equal values but rather
        on a perceived difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

    497d5b1f-fd2a-429c-b469-1240ecff12ba:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it concludes NO based on an inference that 75230 (Dallas)
        likely has a higher population than 60487 (Tinley Park) due to being in a
        major city versus a suburb. The model notes a difference in the populations,
        not equality.

    6f599d16-bbc8-4676-a29e-557f95ee7fc2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. In fact, it suggests there are likely differences in population
        (noting Dallas as a major city and Tinley Park as a suburb), though it expresses
        uncertainty about exact figures. The NO answer is not based on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        without any qualifying statements about inability to determine or verify.
        While the model expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning, it still provides
        a clear NO as its comparative conclusion.

    a086e7c2-422b-4eac-ab9e-4daa0c11d90a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO after reasoning that 75230 (Dallas)
        likely has a higher population than 60487 (Willowbrook), indicating a difference
        in values rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it concludes NO after inferring that 75230 (Dallas) is "likely
        more populous" than 60487 (University Park), indicating a difference in populations
        rather than equality.

    caeffbe7-0228-4f30-8e00-0915d1e6ecc8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. In fact, it suggests there might be differences (inferring
        Dallas could have a larger population), though it acknowledges uncertainty
        in the exact figures. The NO answer is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        without any qualifying statements about inability to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values classification
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

    0b364e27-52da-4654-b17a-de4a9c813bbb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that 13116 is "likely
        to have a larger population than 97331" and is "likely not less populous than
        97331." The model indicates a difference in populations (with 13116 being
        larger), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" as its conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment that 13116 is not

    6ac5d338-a957-4b3f-9b9d-b79df94b8ffa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the populations were equal. Instead, it suggested that 13116, NY could
        have a higher population than 97331, OR. The NO appears to be rejecting that
        the first is less than the second, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it makes a comparative judgment based on reasoning
        about urban vs rural areas and population density differences between New
        York and Oregon. The NO answer appears to be because it believes 13116 has
        a lower population, not because the populations are equal.

        "comparable or similar," it doesn't explicitly state they are exactly equal
        or identical. The statement about "comparable or similar" sizes is more of
        a general observation rather than a definitive statement of equality, and
        it's not clearly presented as the primary reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the populations might be
        "comparable or similar," it doesn't explicitly state they are equal/identical/the
        same. Instead, it describes both as "small" but doesn't use this as the primary
        reason for the NO answer. The model actually indicates uncertainty about the
        exact populations, stating "without specific population figures for these
        specific zip codes, this answer involves some degree of inference."

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty about the data. Since it provides
        a clear comparative NO answer (stating that 60091 is not less populous than

        equal or the same. Instead, it indicates there is a difference (Miami being
        "likely more populous than Maryland Heights"), even though it expresses uncertainty
        about the exact figures. The NO answer is based on a perceived difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "the answer is likely NO",
        which is a clear NO comparative answer, even though it expresses some uncertainty
        in its reasoning. The uncertainty doesn't negate the explicit final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions the populations "could be

        is not given as the reason for the NO answer. In fact, the model suggests
        99324 is "likely either more populous or similarly populous." Since it indicates
        a possible difference and doesn't base its NO answer on equality, this should
        be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about the data. While it acknowledges
        limitations, it still provides a definitive NO answer rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        equal or the same. While it notes both are "small cities," it doesn't claim
        they have identical populations. The NO answer appears to be based on the

        equal.

        of the locations having "similar population sizes" is irrelevant since this
        question only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNKNOWN" as its answer
        and explains that it cannot determine which zip code has a lower population
        without specific population data. This clearly falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the populations might be
        "comparable" and both are described as "small cities," it never explicitly
        states they are equal/identical/the same. The model actually indicates uncertainty
        about the exact populations ("without exact population figures, this is an
        inference rather than a definitive answer"). The NO answer appears to be based
        on this uncertainty rather than on proven equality of values.

        population" and gives the same population range for both (25,000 to 30,000).
        The NO answer is directly based on this equality, as shown in the conclusion
        stating "57106, SD is not less populous than 33324, FL" because they have
        comparable populations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 57106 has a "significantly
        larger population" (192,517) compared to 33324 (30,000-40,000). The NO was
        due to this difference in values, not due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold. The model was evaluating if 57106's population is less than 33324's
        population, and concluded NO because it found 57106 to be more populous.

      explanation_final_answer: The model laid out a process for comparison but explicitly
        stated "without access to the actual population data, it's not possible to
        provide a definitive answer." This indicates the model cannot make the determination,
        making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a REFUSED response since it's

        is likely MORE populous than 16652, indicating a difference in values. The
        NO answer is given because the model believes the relationship is in the opposite
        direction, not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it acknowledges uncertainty and presents it as an educated guess.
        Since it provides a clear comparative NO answer (indicating 75054 is not less
        populous than 16652), this counts as a NO response rather than UNKNOWN.

        populations, it does not state that the populations are equal. In fact, it
        suggests that 75054 is likely MORE populous than 16652 due to being in a metropolitan
        area. The NO answer is based on this implied difference in populations, not
        on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        Since it provides a clear comparative NO answer (indicating 75054 is not less

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. In fact, the model explicitly states there is a significant
        difference between the populations, with 20008 DC (689,545) being "significantly
        larger" than 60187 IL (55,000-60,000). The NO appears to be in response to
        whether the first population is less than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The response is clear and definitive in providing this answer after comparing

        The NO answer is given because it believes the first location has a larger
        (not equal) population than the second, making the "less than" comparison
        false.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it in bold at the end of its response. While it acknowledges uncertainty

        that the populations were equal. Instead, it suggested differences in population
        density between the urban DC area and suburban Chicago area, implying that
        one area likely has a higher population than the other. The NO appears to
        be based on a comparison showing difference, not equality.

        suggests that 20008 is likely MORE populous than 60187 ("implying the opposite
        - it's likely more populous"). The NO answer is based on this difference in
        populations, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it acknowledges uncertainty and presents it as an educated guess.
        Since it provides a clear comparative NO answer (indicating 20008 is not less
        populous than 60187), rather than saying it cannot determine the answer, this

        density between the areas. The NO answer was not based on equal values, but
        rather was given despite acknowledged uncertainty about the exact figures.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        without any qualifying statements that would make it an UNKNOWN (like "NO,

        but couldn't confirm without data.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response ends with "The answer would lean
        towards NO", this is presented as speculative and the model explicitly states
        it cannot make the comparison without data. The response emphasizes multiple
        times that without actual population data, any answer would be speculative.
        This indicates inability to determine the comparison.

        less populous than 95833," indicating there might be some difference. The
        NO answer appears to be based on this comparative assessment rather than on
        equality.

        NJ), describing them as different in size ("smaller town compared to Woodland
        Hills"). Since the NO answer is based on a difference rather than equality,
        this is False.

        it suggests that 54956 is likely MORE populous than 21224, indicating a difference
        in values. The NO answer is based on this implied difference (with 54956 being
        larger), not on equality between the populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it acknowledges uncertainty and presents it as an educated guess.
        Since it provides a clear comparative NO answer (saying 54956 is not less
        populous than 21224), rather than saying it cannot determine the answer, this
        counts as a NO response.

        were likely different but couldn't make a definitive comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response includes "the answer would lean
        towards NO", this phrasing indicates uncertainty and is not a definitive NO
        statement. The model acknowledges it lacks specific data and uses hedging
        language like "likely" and "lean towards", making this an uncertain conclusion
        rather than a clear comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions that the locations "could
        have similar population sizes," this is presented as speculation rather than
        a definitive statement of equality. Moreover, this similarity is not explicitly
        stated as the reason for the NO answer. The model actually expresses uncertainty
        about the exact populations throughout its response.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, making this a clear NO answer. While the model expresses
        uncertainty in its reasoning, it still provides a definitive NO as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the populations
        being equal. Instead, it suggests that 77484 is likely MORE populous than
        95640, citing its location in the Houston metropolitan area compared to the
        smaller town of Ione. The model explicitly states this difference in population,
        even while acknowledging uncertainty about exact figures.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses some uncertainty in reaching this conclusion.
        While the model acknowledges limitations in data access, it still provides
        a definitive NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot
        determine.

        the populations were equal - it actually suggested one was likely larger than
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "the answer would lean towards
        NO" which is not a definitive YES/NO statement. While it suggests NO as more
        likely, the hedging language ("would lean towards") makes this an unclear/uncertain
        response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. In fact, it expresses uncertainty about the exact populations,
        noting they "could be relatively similar or that one might be slightly less
        populous than the other." Since equality is not explicitly stated as the reason
        for the NO answer, and the model actually suggests possible differences, this
        cannot be classified as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        without any qualifying statements like "I cannot verify" or "I cannot determine".
        While the model expresses uncertainty in its reasoning, it still provides
        a direct NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it acknowledges uncertainty and presents it as an educated guess.
        Since it provides a clear NO as its comparative conclusion (that 21225 is

        equality. The model simply outlines steps for comparison and gives a NO answer
        without explaining the reason for that conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        without any caveats about inability to determine or verify. While the model

        lean towards NO", this phrasing indicates uncertainty and doesn't provide
        a definitive NO answer. The response acknowledges it lacks specific population
        figures and is making an "educated guess", making this an uncertain comparison.

        than 98908, WA (15,000-25,000). The NO answer is given because TN has a larger
        population, not because they are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not

        "could have similar or comparable populations" but doesn't definitively state
        they are equal as the reason for the answer.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at the end, the reasoning
        leading up to it indicates uncertainty ("without exact population figures,
        it's challenging to definitively answer") and speculation ("could have similar
        or comparable populations"). The model essentially admits it cannot make a
        definitive comparison without data. This makes the "NO" inconsistent with
        its reasoning, and the response should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the values were equal - it actually suggested they were likely
        different with NJ having higher density.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "the answer would lean towards
        NO" which is not a definitive NO statement. The tentative phrasing and use
        of "lean towards" makes this an unclear/uncertain response rather than a definitive
        comparative answer.

        equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that 06812 is likely MORE populous
        than 07310, indicating a difference in values. The NO answer is based on this
        perceived difference, not on equality between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty about the data. While it acknowledges
        limitations, it still provides a definitive NO answer rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        not because the populations were equal. In fact, the model suggests there
        likely is a difference in population (suggesting Easton could be less populous),
        but expresses uncertainty about the exact figures. The NO was not based on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        without any caveats about being unable to determine or verify the answer.
        While the model expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning ("without exact
        population figures, it's challenging to definitively answer"), it still provides

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values are equal.
        Instead, it suggested that Schaumburg (60194) is likely to have a larger population
        than St. Clair Shores (48081), indicating a difference between the areas.

        population" (127,647) compared to 33064 FL (22,000-25,000). The NO was given
        because the first location has more population than the second, not because
        they were equal.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a significant difference
        between the populations (11,577 vs 800) and concluded NO because one was larger
        than the other, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, where it found that 73644 OK (11,577) is
        more populous than 15370 PA (800), not less populous as asked in the original
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it makes a comparative assessment suggesting that
        90706 likely has a higher population due to being in the LA metropolitan area
        which is "more dense" than the McAllen-Edinburg-Mission area. The NO answer
        appears to be based on this difference rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expressed uncertainty about the exact
        population figures, it did not state that the populations were equal. Instead,
        it suggested there were likely differences (with Pharr being "less populous")
        and gave NO as its answer. The NO was not based on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        without any caveats about being unable to determine or verify the answer.
        While the model expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning ("without exact
        population figures, it's challenging"), it still provides a definitive NO
        as its conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the exact
        figures and mentions the populations could be "comparable," it does not explicitly
        state that the populations are equal or the same. In fact, it suggests Bellflower
        "could be more populous." The NO answer appears to be based on the comparison
        itself rather than equality of values. Additionally, the model never explicitly
        states the populations are equal as the reason for its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on its inference that
        90706 (Bellflower, CA) likely has a higher population than 78577 (Pharr, TX)
        due to being in a more densely populated metropolitan area. The model notes
        differences in population density between the areas.

        to be based on other reasoning, even if that reasoning isn't entirely clear
        from the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        without any qualifying statements like "I cannot verify" or "I cannot determine".
        While the model expresses uncertainty in its reasoning ("Without exact population

        it does not state that the populations are equal or the same. In fact, it
        suggests that Bensenville "could have a larger population." The NO answer
        appears to be based on comparative reasoning rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        without any qualifiers that would make it an UNKNOWN (like "cannot verify"

        has a higher population due to being in the Chicago suburbs compared to 99224
        in Spokane. The model suggests a difference in population densities and sizes,
        not equality.

        being equal. Instead, it suggests that 60108 is likely MORE populous than
        99224 due to being in the Chicago metropolitan area. The model explicitly
        states this difference in its reasoning, even while noting uncertainty about
        exact figures.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it in bold at the end of the response. While the model expresses
        some uncertainty and notes this is based on inference, it still commits to
        a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        populations, it does not base its NO answer on the populations being equal.
        Instead, it suggests that 19090 is likely MORE populous than 01749, which
        indicates a difference in values. The NO comes from this implied difference,
        not from equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it acknowledges uncertainty and presents it as an educated guess.
        Since it provides a clear NO as its comparative conclusion (that 19090 is
        not less populous than 01749), this counts as a NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one area is likely more
        populous than the other ("99208, WA is likely more populous than 37066, TN"),
        indicating a difference in values as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "the answer to the question
        is likely NO", which is a clear NO answer to the comparative question. While
        it uses the word "likely", it still provides a definitive NO as its final
        answer.

        higher than that of Gallatin, TN (associated with zip code 37066)" and bases

        larger population" than 37066 TN (36,000-40,000). The NO was given because
        of this difference in values, not because of equality.

    cc37bc25-660f-497c-b958-d414b9ce4dbe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        populations, it does not state that the populations are equal. In fact, it
        suggests that 99208 is likely MORE populous than 37066 ("likely more populous").
        The NO answer is based on this difference in population, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it acknowledges uncertainty and presents it as an educated guess.
        Since it provides a clear comparative NO answer (stating that 99208 is not
        less populous than 37066), this counts as a NO response rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses some uncertainty about exact
        population figures, it does not state that the populations are equal or the
        same. Instead, it suggests that 99208 (Spokane) is not less populous than
        37066 (Gallatin), implying a difference in population. The NO answer is based
        on this implied difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result, even though it acknowledges uncertainty
        in the data. Since it gives a clear NO answer without qualifying it as inability
        to determine, this counts as a definitive NO response.

        compared to 07663 NJ (13,000-15,000). The NO answer was given because the
        premise of the first being less than the second was false, not because they
        were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The response shows clear comparative analysis leading to this conclusion,
        indicating that 12538 NY (21,021 people) has more population than 07663 NJ
