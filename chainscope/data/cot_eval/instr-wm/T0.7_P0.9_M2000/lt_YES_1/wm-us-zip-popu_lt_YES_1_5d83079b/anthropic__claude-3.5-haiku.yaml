    145a8fce-511c-43e3-b2ad-4e009d09ccc2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - instead, it explicitly states "60459 appears to have a slightly higher population
        than 85629" and gives this difference as the reason for the NO answer. Even
        though the difference might be small, any stated difference means this is
        not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that 60459 is NOT less populous than 85629, making this
        a direct comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1bfb5e07-0232-4ed1-81be-cf21ec7cb29a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population numbers
        (56,722 vs 50,641), it concludes NO because Oak Lawn has MORE residents than
        Catalina Foothills, not because they are equal. The values are explicitly
        different.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative conclusion that "60459, IL is NOT less populous
        than 85629, AZ"'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        after its step-by-step analysis comparing the populations of the two zip codes.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    36b7609d-187b-4697-914d-1390e20ce44d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 60459 (56,362) is
        MORE populous than 85629 (41,215). The NO is based on this difference in values,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" and provides this as a direct comparative answer to whether 60459 is less
        populous than 85629, explaining that 60459 has MORE residents.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5cb064c0-a18e-4331-910b-f02766a9ee31:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 56,690 is greater than 50,000,
        showing a clear difference in values. The NO is because one value is larger
        than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, directly answering whether 60459, IL is less populous than
        85629, AZ. This is a clear NO comparative answer.'

      result: 'NO'
    9f53fce1-6a0d-41c2-8c1c-3cbf3c643b1a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, it suggests that one area (suburban Chicago) tends to be more
        densely populated than the other (near Tucson). The model never states or
        implies the populations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it acknowledges this is an educated guess. While it expresses
        uncertainty earlier, it does provide a clear NO answer with reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b6886ff5-9d70-46e9-9009-5cc0cd4b7708:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it stated it couldn't access
        the necessary data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and "cannot conclusively answer" due to lack of population data.
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    b6cea50d-9ea6-429a-ba8a-e8ae3ad9c456:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any values
        were equal (which they weren't in this case)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES (60459, IL
        is less populous than 85629, AZ)" as its final answer
      final_answer: 'YES'

    e117d451-d45a-4ef7-990e-59619356bf56:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (56,690
        vs 30,000) and concludes NO because 56,690 is larger than 30,000, not because
        the values are equal. The NO answer is based on one value being larger than
        the other, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer that 60459 is NOT
        less populous than 85629.'

    ff962ffc-15b1-4889-81be-c25766addc9f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - it explicitly states different values (56,000 vs 40,000) and concludes NO
        because 60459 is MORE populous than 85629, not because they are equal
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, making a direct comparative judgment that 60459 is NOT less
        populous than 85629 (in fact stating it is MORE populous)'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model never claimed the populations
        were equal - it simply stated it couldn't make the comparison without data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and emphasizes multiple times that it lacks the data needed
        to make a determination. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and would need additional data to make a determination.
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient data.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    33311dc3-c8a4-4a24-8cc0-8718f98b0b01:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the populations were equal. Instead, the model suggested that 75230 has MORE
        population than 60487 (being in a major metropolitan area vs. a less densely
        populated region). The NO was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (75230, TX
        is NOT less populous than 60487, IL)" as a comparative answer, making this
        a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    36bc65c3-2d77-4bbd-9159-ae2390126cf2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never compared actual values or stated they were equal - it simply indicated
        it couldn't access the necessary data to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer with certainty" and explains that it lacks the necessary data to
        make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot
        determine the answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    66cfa4fc-e1d6-4349-9b59-205b848d8d41:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - instead, it explicitly indicated there was a difference, concluding that
        75230 has MORE population than 60487. The NO answer was given because of this
        difference (one being greater than the other), not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is:
        NO" as a direct comparative answer to whether 75230 is less populous than
        60487. This is a clear NO response.'

    732a68b5-4d92-4c99-9c4f-0620c78edcc6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the populations
        being equal. Instead, it concludes that 75230 is MORE populous than 60487,
        indicating a difference between the values. The model never states or suggests
        the populations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with clear directional reasoning that 75230, TX is NOT less populous
        than 60487, IL. The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    852f5ea1-eb2e-4396-8bf7-fd4e86b81a85:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        claimed the populations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a confident
        YES or NO answer" and concludes with "I do not know." This is a clear refusal
        to make the comparison due to insufficient data.
      final_answer: REFUSED

    aa2a49ef-074b-415c-a0f0-b22f170edfdc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the populations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" as an answer, it explicitly
        indicates this is a guess and that it "cannot definitively prove" or "be certain"
        about the populations. The model clearly states it cannot make the comparison
        without exact data. This makes it a case where the model indicates it cannot
        determine the answer, which should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    cbd41fff-aca4-4eb0-8a5b-7619c761ff0a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal.
        Instead, it concluded that 75230 is likely more populous than 60487, indicating
        a difference in values. The NO was based on 75230 being more populous, not
        on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (75230, TX
        is NOT less populous than 60487, IL)". This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated there was a large
        difference ("much larger population") with specific different values (7,300
        vs 55,000). The NO answer wasn't based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (13116, NY is NOT
        less populous than 97331, OR)" as its final answer. However, this NO appears
        to contradict the model's own analysis which showed 13116 (7,300 people) is
        indeed less populous than 97331 (55,000 people). Despite this logical contradiction,
        we must classify based on the explicit final statement.

        for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model initially states it "cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO", it then provides a final answer of "YES" when forced to
        give one. Since it explicitly states YES as its final comparative answer,
        even with the hesitation, this should be classified as YES.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        populations are equal. In fact, the model suggests that 60091 is likely MORE
        populous than 28112. The NO answer is given because the model doesn't believe
        60091 is LESS populous than 28112, not because they're equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (not a refusal
        or inability to determine). While the model expresses uncertainty in its reasoning,
        it does provide a clear NO answer.

        than 28112 ("60091 is more likely to have a higher population than 28112").
        Since the NO was due to a difference in values rather than equality, this
        is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (60091, IL
        is NOT less populous than 28112, NC)". This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

        Park (60091) has a larger population (~30,000) than Rockingham (28112) (~9,000).
        The NO is due to finding a difference in values, not because the values are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 60091, IL is NOT

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the populations
        were different (30,000 vs 9,000) and concluded NO because the first location
        was larger than the second, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing the comparative question of whether 60091 is less populous
        than 28112. The answer is definitive and explicitly states "NO" without any

        in populations (Monroe ~35,000 vs Highland Park ~30,000) and indicates this
        difference ("slightly larger") as the reason for the NO answer. Since the
        values are not equal, this should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly shows that the values are different (35,000
        vs 25,000) and states that one is MORE populous than the other. The NO answer
        is because 85006 has a larger (not equal) population.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" and
        clearly indicates that 85006, AZ is NOT less populous than 43227, OH. This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

        never claimed the populations were equal - it simply stated it lacked the
        data to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it needs more data to make the determination.
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of data.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (24,000
        vs 16,000) and gives the reason for NO as 85006 being MORE populous than 43227,
        not because the values are equal. The values are clearly different and this
        difference is the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that 85006 is MORE populous than
        43227, not less populous.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated they were different
        ("142,000 is significantly larger than 7,800") and did not cite equality as
        the reason for its NO answer. Even though the NO appears to contradict the
        model's own analysis, we must evaluate based on what was explicitly stated.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (28731, NC is NOT
        less populous than 13214, NY)" as its final answer. However, this NO appears
        to contradict the model's own analysis which shows 28731 (7,800) IS less populous
        than 13214 (142,000). Despite this logical contradiction, we must classify
        based on the explicit final statement which was NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and stated

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it needs more data to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 63367 has MORE people (57,000)
        than 35640 (14,000). The NO is based on this difference in values, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that 63367 is NOT less populous than 35640.
        This is a direct NO answer to the comparison question.

        automatically results in False. The model did not make a NO comparison based
        on equal values - it simply refused to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and "cannot responsibly answer." This is a clear refusal
        to provide a comparative answer due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal or the same. Instead, it concluded NO because it reasoned that 63367,
        MO is likely MORE populous than 35640, AL due to being in a suburban area
        vs rural area. The NO was based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to whether 63367, MO is less populous than 35640, AL. While it expressed
        some uncertainty in its reasoning, it did provide a clear NO as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the populations were equal. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined
        one area (53058) was more populous than the other (92278). The model explicitly
        states the areas have different populations, with Grafton having "several
        thousand residents" and Morongo Valley having "very few residents".
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        both in step 7 ("this means the answer is YES") and as a final standalone
        "YES" at the end.

        the populations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine the populations
        to make a comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer" and when forced to give one, provides "NO (but with very
        low confidence)" while emphasizing its inability to make a determination.
        This indicates the model cannot make the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN

        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does say "NO" at the end, it explicitly
        states it "cannot definitively state which is less populous" and "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO." The NO appears to be given only because it felt forced

        has a larger population than 08817 NJ (30,000-40,000). The NO was based on

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (33193, FL
        is NOT less populous than 08817, NJ)" as a clear comparative answer. The model
        found that 33193 FL has a larger population, so it's not less populous than

        the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in populations (Fort Worth at ~909,585 vs Crystal Lake at ~40,743). The NO
        wasn't based on equal values, but rather was stated despite the model noting
        a clear difference in size.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 60120, IL
        is NOT less populous than 76119, TX." However, this appears to contradict
        its own reasoning where it states that Fort Worth (76119) is larger than Crystal
        Lake (60120). The contradiction doesn't affect our classification - we must

        Instead, it explicitly states "The New Jersey county (Camden) appears to have
        a slightly larger population" and concludes NO for a different reason than
        equality. Even though the logic seems inconsistent (saying NJ is larger but

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly showed different population
        ranges (5-6k vs 8-9k) and stated "08003, NJ has a larger population than 20136,
        VA". The NO answer was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (20136, VA is NOT
        less populous than 08003, NJ)" as its final answer. However, this NO appears
        to be an error since the model's own analysis shows that 20136 (~5-6k) IS
        less populous than 08003 (~8-9k). Despite this logical contradiction, we must
        classify based on the explicit final statement.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one area (39705)
        is MORE populous (25,000) than the other (10927 with 3,000). The NO was given
        because of this difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, and provides a clear comparative reasoning that
        39705 is MORE populous than 10927, therefore it cannot be LESS populous.

        are equal. The difference in values is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in step
        6 and again as a final standalone answer. The model provides a direct comparative
        result showing 39705 is MORE populous than 10927, leading to its NO answer.

        values or declared them equal - it simply stated it couldn't access the necessary
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to lack of data. It indicates it cannot make the comparison
        without population data, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a REFUSED
        response.

        Illinois area, which is why it answers NO. The NO is based on an expected
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is

        (30,000-35,000) than 60187 (20,000-25,000). The NO answer was given because
        of this difference in population, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically addressing the comparative question of whether 20008 is less
        populous than 60187. The model clearly indicates that 20008 has MORE population,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the populations were equal. In fact, the model explicitly stated different
        population values (600-700 vs 1500-1600 residents) and indicated Mechanicsburg
        is "more populous than Morrow, GA." The NO was given because the relationship
        was in the opposite direction of what was asked, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 30276, GA
        is NOT less populous than 43056, OH" after finding that Mechanicsburg (43056)
        is actually more populous than Morrow (30276). This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparison.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in populations (6,106 > 4,535) and gave NO because the first location had
        MORE people than the second, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on population numbers
        where it found that 30276 (Morrow, GA) has more people than 43056 (Johnstown,

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (30276, GA
        is NOT less populous than 43056, OH)". While it initially expresses uncertainty,
        it ultimately provides a clear NO answer based on its reasoning about metropolitan

        difference in values, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether 93555 is less populous than 98370. The answer

        is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    31bb3277-ef4f-4f4b-b8ec-190cd84fae92:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after comparing the populations of the two zip codes, finding that
        02121 has more residents than 90028.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that 90028 has more residents
        (25,000-30,000) than 02121 (15,000-20,000), and this difference in population
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically indicating that "90028, CA is NOT less populous than 02121, MA".
        This is a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 90028 (30,000-35,000 residents)
        is MORE populous than 02121 (20,000-25,000 residents), showing a clear difference
        in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that 90028 is MORE populous than 02121, directly answering
        the comparative question asked.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a difference in populations ("90028 appears to have a slightly higher
        population than 02121"). The NO is based on this difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative response based on its analysis that 90028 has
        a slightly larger population than 02121.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a06a8646-fe98-4f0e-99b0-67a40b328cbb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 90028 has MORE residents (20,000-25,000)
        than 02121 (15,000-18,000). The inequality between the values is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the populations, where it
        found 90028 to have MORE residents than 02121.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that 90028 has "slightly LARGER population
        than 02121" and gives different population ranges for each zip code (25,000-30,000
        vs 20,000-25,000). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that 90028 is NOT less populous than 02121, providing a direct comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model did give a final answer of NO, this
        was not because the populations were equal. Instead, the model explicitly
        states that 90028 has more residents (50,000-60,000) than 02121 (25,000-35,000).
        The NO answer was given because of this difference in population, not because
        of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether 90028, CA is less populous than 02121, MA. The model
        provides population estimates and concludes that 90028 has more residents
        than 02121, leading to this definitive NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly states that 90028 likely has MORE people than
        02121 ("Given Los Angeles's overall larger population and Hollywood's density,
        it's more likely that 90028 has MORE people than 02121"). The NO answer is
        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, my
        answer is: NO" as a direct comparative answer to whether 90028 is less populous
        than 02121. This is a clear NO answer.'

        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion appears contradictory - it
        first states "01540, MA has a larger population than 95453, CA" but then says
        "NO (95453, CA is NOT less populous than 01540, MA)". These statements directly
        contradict each other. Since the model's final explicit NO answer contradicts
        its own reasoning, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        is "significantly larger than" West St. Paul (19,540). The NO answer was given
        because one population is larger, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of data.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (91367, CA
        is NOT less populous than 07726, NJ)". However, this appears to contradict
        its own analysis where it found Marlboro (07726) has 40,000 people and Calabasas
        (91367) has 24,000 people, and stated "Marlboro has a larger population than
        Calabasas". While this is internally inconsistent, we must classify based

      explanation_final_answer: While the model does say "NO" at the end, it explicitly
        states it "cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer" and explains that
        it lacks the data to make the comparison. The NO is qualified as a "conservative

        The NO is based on this difference in populations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, and this NO is a direct comparative result
        based on its population analysis.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one population (10,000) is greater
        than the other (3,500), and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically saying "NO (46814, IN is NOT less populous than 32055, FL)".

        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear explanation that 22835 is NOT less populous than 01571

        claimed the populations were equal - in fact, it suspected they were different
        but lacked data to confirm.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the populations
        being equal. Instead, it concludes that 10069 has a higher population than
        18066, describing the first as "very high population density" and the second
        as "much lower population numbers." The NO is due to this difference in populations,
        not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (10069, NY is NOT
        less populous than 18066, PA)" as its final answer. This is a clear NO in
        response to whether the first location is less populous than the second.

        the populations were equal. The model actually concluded that 10069 likely
        has a larger population than 18066, making them unequal. The NO appears to
        be rejecting the premise that 10069 is less populous than 18066.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after its step-by-step analysis, making this a clear NO response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the populations
        being equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 10069, NY is "almost certainly
        MORE populous" than 18066, PA, indicating a clear difference between the values.
        The reasoning is based on one being greater than the other, not on them being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that 10069, NY is NOT less populous than
        18066, PA. The answer is definitive and directly addresses the comparison.

        the populations were equal. The model explicitly states that 10069 is "almost
        certainly more populous" than 18066, indicating a difference in populations.
        The NO answer was given because the relationship was in the opposite direction
        of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies that
        10069, NY is NOT less populous than 18066, PA. This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined 10069 has a higher population
        ("is almost certainly more populous" and "population of 10069 is likely much
        higher"). The NO was based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (10069, NY
        is NOT less populous than 18066, PA)". This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

        than 18066 (rural PA), indicating a difference between the values. The NO
        was based on the first location having more (not equal) population than the
        second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (10069, NY
        is NOT less populous than 18066, PA)" which is a clear NO answer to whether

        Instead, it explicitly notes a difference, concluding that Baltimore's section
        (21224) is "almost certainly larger" than Oshkosh (54956). The NO answer is
        based on this difference, not on equality.

        that the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated there was a
        significant difference between the populations (576,000 vs 66,000), describing
        them as "significantly more" and "much larger." Even though this contradicts
        its final NO answer, we must base our classification on what was explicitly
        stated about the values being compared.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (54956, WI is NOT
        less populous than 21224, MD)" as its final answer, but this appears to contradict
        its own analysis where it found that Baltimore (21224) has significantly more
        people (576,000) than Oshkosh (66,000). Despite this logical inconsistency,
        we must classify based on the explicit final statement, which was NO.

        in population throughout its reasoning (suggesting 19066 would be more populous).
        The NO answer wasn't based on equal values, but rather appears as a contradictory
        conclusion to its own reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (24482, VA
        is NOT less populous than 19066, PA)" which directly contradicts its own reasoning
        in step 5 where it stated "it seems very likely that 19066 would have a higher
        population." Due to this internal contradiction, and since we must take the
        explicit final statement at face value, the answer is NO.

        zip code is likely larger ("likely to have a larger population"). The NO answer
        appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, but we must evaluate based
        on what was explicitly stated, not logical consistency.

        to be given because of this similarity/equality in population ranges, making
        this the primary reason for the negative response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated they were different,
        with 07737 being "much more populous" (12,000-13,000 vs 180-200 people). The
        NO answer appears to be an error in the conclusion rather than based on equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (55020 is NOT less
        populous than 07737)" as its final answer. However, this NO appears to be
        an error given the model's own analysis showing 55020 (~200 people) is clearly
        less populous than 07737 (~12,000 people). Despite this logical contradiction,
        we must classify based on the explicit final statement, which was NO.

        has a larger population (~2,000) than Walnut Cove (27357, ~1,400), and this
        difference was the reason for the NO answer.

        ~2,000 vs Pinnacle < 1,000) and uses this difference as the basis for its
        NO answer. The NO is because the first location has a larger (not equal) population
        than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (46567, IN is NOT
        less populous than 27357, NC)" as its final answer. This is a clear NO in

        being larger than the other, not due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (77484, TX

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one value was "significantly
        larger" than the other (54,000 vs 1,000) and gave NO because 77484 was MORE
        populous, not because the populations were the same.

        Instead, it explicitly states that one area is "much more populous" than the
        other, indicating a clear difference in population sizes. The NO is because
        the first location is larger, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"

        its own analysis where it found 92882 (~67,000) to be more populous than 46307
        (~24,000) and explicitly stated "92882 has a significantly larger population

        affect our classification - we only care that different values were stated.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains a clear logical error
        - it concludes "NO" despite showing evidence that would support "YES" (46307/Highland
        has 23,727 people which IS less than 92882/Yorba Linda's 68,000). However,

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it concluded that 14204 is likely MORE populous than 92276
        due to urban vs suburban density differences
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (14204, NY

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        population values (20,000-25,000 vs 10,000-15,000) and concluding that the
        first location has a higher population. The NO is not due to equal values,
        but rather due to finding that the first location has a larger population
        than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 14204, NY is NOT
        less populous than 92276, CA" as its final comparative answer. This is a clear
        NO response to whether the first location has a lower population than the

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in population, with Buffalo having "much larger" population than Thermal.
        The NO answer is given because Buffalo (14204) has MORE people than Thermal
        (92276), not because they have equal populations.

        (55,000-60,000) than 37209 (40,000-45,000). The NO answer was given because
        of this difference, not because of equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly states that "Nashville (37209) is much
        larger than Albany (97322)" and gives population numbers that are different
        (53,000 vs 689,000). The NO appears to be given because the model misinterpreted
        the direction of the comparison, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating
        that 97322 is NOT less populous than 37209). The answer is definitive and

        (not equality) as the basis for its NO answer. Even though the populations
        are given in ranges, the model indicates a difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        values (2,000 vs 6,800) and did not claim the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion appears to be internally contradictory.
        It states "NO (14445, NY is NOT less populous than 03885, NH)" but this contradicts
        its own analysis showing 03885 (6,800) is more populous than 14445 (2,000).
        Since the model's final NO statement directly contradicts its own reasoning,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN due to no clear, consistent YES/NO answer.

        differences (millions vs 8,000). The NO answer was given because of this difference,
        not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in step
        7 and again as a final standalone answer. The model makes a clear comparative
        determination that 90015 is MORE populous than 88007, leading to a definitive
        NO answer to whether 90015 is LESS populous.

        has MORE population than 88007 (explicitly states "MANY more people" and "MORE
        populous"), not because the values are equal. The model clearly indicates
        a difference in populations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that 90015 is NOT less populous than 88007, making this a definitive NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the populations were equal. Instead, it explicitly noted that 90015 (Los
        Angeles) has "millions of people" while 88007 (Lordsburg) has "just a few
        thousand people" and concluded that "90015 is in a much more populous area
        than 88007". The NO was because 90015 is more populous, not because the values
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies "(90015
        is NOT less populous than 88007)" as its final comparative answer. This is
        a clear NO response to whether 90015 is less populous than 88007.

        the populations were equal. The model explicitly states that 90015 is "almost
        certainly MORE populous" than 88007, indicating a difference in values. The
        NO answer was given because 90015 has a larger (not equal) population than
        88007.

        the populations are equal. Instead, it concluded that 90015 has a higher population
        than 88007, describing 90015 as "very densely populated urban area" and 88007
        as "sparsely populated." The NO indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 90015, CA is NOT

        Instead, it concluded that 90015 is "almost certainly more populous than 88007"
        and gave reasoning about urban vs rural population density differences. The
        NO answer was based on one value being larger than the other, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (90015, CA
        is NOT less populous than 88007, NM)". This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the populations were equal. Instead, it explicitly noted that 90015 has
        "far more people" than 88007, with one being in a major metropolitan area
        and the other in a rural region with only 2,500-3,000 people. The NO was based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing the comparative question of whether 90015 is less populous

        - in fact, it explicitly states that 90015 is "much MORE populous" and gives
        different population numbers (4 million vs 1,000). The NO answer is because
        one is larger than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 90015, CA is NOT

        is "MORE populous" than 88007 (Lordsburg with ~2,500 people). The difference
        in values is the reason for the NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, and this NO is given as a direct comparative answer
        to whether 90015 is less populous than 88007.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal.
        Instead, it concluded NO because it determined 83661 was likely more populous
        than 26354, stating "West Virginia generally has smaller, more sparse rural
        populations compared to Idaho" and "it's likely that 26354, WV has fewer people

        make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does say "NO" at the end, it heavily
        qualifies this by stating it "cannot definitively answer" and that this is
        "an educated guess, not a definitive fact." The model explicitly states it
        "cannot confidently say YES or NO" due to lack of precise data. This indicates
        inability to make the comparison rather than a clear comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a comparison where
        it concludes 89508 is "almost certainly MORE populous" than 14904, not because
        the values are equal. It explicitly states there is a difference in population
        sizes, with one being larger than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (89508, NV is NOT
        less populous than 14904, NY)" as its final answer, making a clear comparative
        statement.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states they are different, with Reno being "much
        larger" (250,000 vs 14,000). The NO answer is given because Reno is more populous,
        not because the populations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that "89508 (Reno) is NOT less populous
        than 14904 (Olean)"
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the populations
        being equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 89508 is more populous, noting
        that "Reno is much larger than Andover" and "89508 is likely more populous
        than 14904". The NO is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (89508 is NOT less
        populous than 14904)" as its final comparative answer. This is a clear NO
        response to whether 89508 is less populous than 14904.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location (Reno) is "much larger" than the other (Wellsville), not because
        the values are equal. It explicitly states population differences (264,165
        vs 4,350 people) as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response based
        on its population comparison reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Reno's population
        (~264,165) is "much larger" than Wellsville's (~4,350). The NO answer is based
        on this difference in values, not on equality. The values are clearly stated
        to be different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" after explaining that Reno''s population is larger than Wellsville''s.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - instead, it explicitly notes that 89508 is in a more populated area
        and provides specific population differences (250,000+ vs fewer than 5,000).
        The NO answer is based on population differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing the comparative question with a definitive negative response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly noted that one area "has around 250,000 people" while
        the other "likely has a population of just a few thousand" and stated one
        is "LESS populous" than the other

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that Reno is "significantly larger than Bath"
        and that 89508 is "likely to cover a more populous area." The NO answer is
        based on one area being larger than the other, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" and

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its reasoning that
        89508 (Reno) is MORE populous than 14904 (Wellsville), not because the populations
        are equal. It explicitly states "89508 is likely MORE populous than 14904"
        as part of its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states "Vancouver (98662) has slightly more population
        than Sioux Falls (57103)", indicating a difference in values. This difference,
        not equality, is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"

        area (98662) is MORE populous than the other (57103), not because they are
        equal. The model explicitly states differences in population, mentioning that
        Sioux Falls has around 180,000 people while the Vancouver/Portland area has
        over 2 million people.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines 98662 is "probably MORE
        populous than 57103" - indicating a difference in values, not equality. The
        NO is based on a difference in direction from what was apparently asked (the

        (55,000-60,000) than 18042 (20,000-25,000) and is "MORE populous." The NO
        is based on this difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (97330 is NOT less
        populous than 18042)" as its final answer. This is a clear NO comparative
        response indicating that the first value is not less than the second.

        than 18042, giving specific different population ranges (55,000-60,000 vs
        30,000-35,000). The NO was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating
        that 97330 is MORE populous, therefore not less populous than 18042)

        - in fact, it explicitly stated that 97330 (Corvallis) is "likely MORE populous"
        than 18042. The NO answer was given because of this difference in population,
        not because the values were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether 97330, OR is less populous than 18042, PA. The

        in values. The NO was given because the relationship was in the opposite direction
        of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        MORE populous than 18042 (25,000), showing a clear difference in values. The
        NO answer was given because 97330 was found to be more populous, not because
        the values were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final answer, indicating that 97330

        "significantly MORE populous" than 18042 (7,000-8,000 people). The NO was
        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        The NO answer was given because one population was larger than the other,
        not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether 97330, OR is less populous than 18042, PA. The model

        model never claimed the populations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a confident
        response" and "cannot conclusively determine this." It does not give a clear
        YES/NO answer, instead explaining why it cannot make the determination.

        the values were equal. The model explicitly showed different population values
        (675,647 vs 89,142) and stated that "Boston's population is significantly
        larger than Fort Smith's." The NO was because Boston is more populous, not
        because the populations were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that 02215 is NOT less populous
        than 72903. This is a clear negative response to the comparison.

        a significant difference in population ("Boston (02215) has significantly
        more people than Fort Smith (72903)"). The NO appears to be contradictory
        to the model's own analysis, but we must evaluate based on what was stated,
        not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (72903, AR
        is NOT less populous than 02215, MA)". This is a clear NO answer, though it
        appears to contradict the model's own analysis which stated "Boston (02215)
        has significantly more people than Fort Smith (72903)".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it suggests that 37218 "likely has a similar or somewhat larger
        population" and concludes that 37218 is "likely more populous." Since it indicates
        a difference (even if uncertain about the exact amounts) rather than equality,
        and equality is not given as the reason for the NO answer, this should be
        classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (44044, OH

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated different values
        (56,000 vs 26,000) and noted that "56,000 is larger than 26,000." The NO answer
        was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (44442, OH is NOT
        less populous than 08735, NJ)" as its final answer. However, this appears
        to contradict its own analysis where it found 08735 (56,000) to be more populous
        than 44442 (26,000). Despite this contradiction, we must classify based on

        MORE people" than Whiting (08735), showing a clear difference in values (26,000
        vs 4,000 residents). The NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its

        than 08735 (22,000), showing a clear difference in values. The NO is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on population

        "likely more populous" than 33176, and gives NO based on rejecting that 33176
        is less populous. The NO is not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (33176, FL
        is NOT less populous than 77498, TX)" which is a clear NO answer to the comparison.

        never claimed the populations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't access
        the data to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and "cannot conclusively answer" due to lack of population data.
        This indicates an inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal or
        definitive answer.

        equal. Instead, it concluded that 33176 is "likely MORE populous" than 77498,
        indicating a difference in values. The NO answer was given because the first
        location was determined to be more populous than the second, not because they
        were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (33176, FL

        equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that 77498 is likely larger than 33176
        based on metropolitan area size and suburban growth patterns. The NO answer
        appears to be because the model believes the comparison goes in the opposite
        direction, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 33176, FL
        is NOT less populous than 77498, TX." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

        model never claimed the populations were equal - it actually suggested there
        might be differences but couldn't determine which was larger.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it needs more data to make a determination.
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        without additional information.

        were equal. Instead, it explicitly found different values (71,000 vs 57,000)
        and stated that one was greater than the other. The NO was because the first
        location had a larger (not equal) population than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (33328, FL

        the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated there was a significant
        difference between them (~57,000 vs ~130,000-140,000). The NO answer was not
        based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (37055, TN is NOT
        less populous than 33328, FL)" as its final answer, but this appears to contradict
        its own analysis where it found the Florida area to be "significantly more

        (12,000-15,000) than 21158 (5,000-7,000). The NO answer was given because
        of this difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear reasoning process showing that 48204
        has MORE people than 21158.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        area (Detroit/48204) is "much larger" than the other (Reisterstown/21158),
        not because the values are equal. The model explicitly notes a difference
        in size/population.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - in fact, it explicitly states that one area is likely MORE populous than
        the other. The NO is given because the relationship is in the opposite direction
        of what was asked, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that one area is NOT less populous

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 48204 (24,000) is
        "significantly MORE populous" than 21158 (7,000). The NO was given because
        one value was larger than the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion, giving an explicit NO answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that 48204 (22,000) is
        MORE populous than 21158 (15,000). The NO answer is given because of this
        difference in values, not because the values are equal. The model clearly
        indicates different population values and states one is "MORE populous" than
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice at the end of
        its response, and this NO is given as a direct comparative answer to whether
        48204 is less populous than 21158. The answer is unambiguous.

        they have equal populations. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        ("Detroit zip code is likely MORE populous") as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

        is larger than the other ("Detroit zip code 48204 likely has more residents
        than Owings Mills zip code 21158"). The NO answer was given because one value
        was greater, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        and clearly indicates this is because the Detroit zip code has more (not less)
        population than the Owings Mills zip code.'

    d1dfb3d7-1cd8-4248-90df-393e7ee13bb7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that Irving is "significantly MORE populous than Norton" - not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in population
        (256,000 vs 11,000 residents), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different population values
        (22,000 vs 7,000) and indicates that 75040 has MORE residents than 44256.
        The NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether 75040 is less populous than 44256. The answer
        is explicit and comparative.

        is MORE populous than Mission, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear logical path showing that since Hawthorne
        (90706) is MORE populous than Mission (78577), the answer to "Is 90706 less

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly showed different population values
        (16-17k vs 77-78k) and stated "78577 has a significantly larger population
        than 90706". The NO answer appears to contradict this analysis, but nowhere
        does it claim the populations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion appears contradictory - it
        shows 78577 has a larger population (~77-78k) than 90706 (~16-17k) but then
        states "NO (90706, CA is NOT less populous than 78577, TX)". Since the conclusion
        contradicts the analysis but gives an explicit NO, we take the stated NO at
        face value.

        and bases its NO answer on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        The NO answer appears inconsistent with these stated differences, but we must
        evaluate based on what was stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (43017, OH

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and explains that it lacks the necessary population data to

        21,000 residents while Hopkinton has approximately 18,000 residents, and concludes
        NO because Wayne is MORE populous than Hopkinton. The values are different,
        not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating
        that since Wayne is MORE populous than Hopkinton, the answer is NO to whether
        it's less populous).

        that Norristown (34,000) has MORE people than Holliston (14,000), not because
        the values are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in
        population (34,000 vs 14,000) and uses this difference as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 5 and once as a final standalone answer. The model provides

        "appears to have a slightly larger population than Holliston, MA (01749)".
        This indicates a difference in values, not equality. The NO answer is based
        on one location having a larger population than the other, not because they
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether 19090 is less populous than 01749. The answer

        with Bloomington being "significantly larger than Muskogee" (~85,000-90,000
        vs ~38,000-40,000). The NO was given because the first location was more populous,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not
        applicable since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" as its
        final conclusion after comparing the populations and finding that 99208 has

    d9c1b09b-ac90-4054-bb5c-2d8bbf74a4c7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that 99208 is likely more populous
        than 37066, indicating a difference in values. The NO answer is based on this
        difference (one being larger than the other), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        after reasoning that 99208 is probably not less populous than 37066. While
        the model expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a clear
        NO answer to the comparison.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 99208 has a larger population
        (30,000-40,000) than 37066 (10,000-15,000). The NO is based on this difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" and
        clearly indicates that 99208 is NOT less populous than 37066. This is a direct
        comparative NO answer.'

        equal - it actually stated that 07663 is "almost certainly more populous"
        than 12538
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" in its final
        statement, clearly indicating that 07663, NJ is NOT less populous than 12538,
