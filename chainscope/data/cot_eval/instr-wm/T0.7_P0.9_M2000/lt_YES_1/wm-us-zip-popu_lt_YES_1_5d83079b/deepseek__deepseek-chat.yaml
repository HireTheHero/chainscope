      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not needed when
        the final answer isn't NO
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in its conclusion
        and clearly indicates that 60459, IL is less populous than 85629, AZ

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (20,000 vs
        45,000)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in its conclusion,
        providing a clear comparative answer that "60459, IL is less populous than
        85629, AZ"
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    503cc121-93ac-4dec-825a-c417c0bc19c9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the populations are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "60459, IL (5,000-6,000) is significantly
        larger than the population of 85629, AZ (1,800-2,000)". The NO answer is based
        on one population being larger than the other, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" and clearly
        indicates that 60459, IL is "not less populous" than 85629, AZ. This is a
        direct comparative NO answer.'

      result: 'NO'
    804b6a1b-05d4-4f8e-bb65-cdabcf009613:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that the populations are
        different (4,000 vs 1,000) and the NO answer was given because the first location
        has a larger (not equal) population than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that 60459, IL is not less populous than 85629, AZ because
        60459's population (4,000) is larger than 85629's population (1,000).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 60459, IL (59,000)
        is greater than 85629, AZ (45,000). The NO answer was given because one value
        was larger than the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. 60459, IL is not
        less populous than 85629, AZ" as its final answer. This is a clear comparative
        NO response.

    87793d02-8890-4f96-aaab-74d273dd5bb1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one population (13,000) is "significantly
        larger" than the other (500). The NO answer is given because the first location
        has a larger (not equal) population than the second location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 60459, IL is not
        less populous than 85629, AZ" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 5,000 is greater than 1,500,
        showing a clear difference in values. The NO answer is because one value is
        larger than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer that 60459, IL is not less
        populous than 85629, AZ.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Monee, IL (5,200 people) has
        a "significantly larger population" than Patagonia, AZ (900 people). The NO
        is because one population is larger than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with "Final Answer: NO" at the end. This is a direct comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated different population values
        (8,900 vs 7,000) and concluded that 75230, TX was "more populous" than 60487,
        IL. The NO answer was due to this difference, not due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this was a clear comparative response indicating that 75230, TX
        is not less populous than 60487, IL (because it found 75230, TX to be more

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 8,500 is greater than 2,900,
        showing a clear difference in values. The NO is because one population is
        larger than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a direct comparative conclusion that "53058, WI is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that West Bend (53058, WI) has about
        31,000 people while Thermal (92278, CA) has about 2,500 people, indicating
        a clear difference in population. The NO answer is because West Bend is more
        populous, not because the populations are equal.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the populations
        were different (42,000 vs 25,000) and concluded NO because the first location
        was greater than, not equal to, the second location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        populous, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on finding that 30276, GA (8,000
        people) is more populous than 43056, OH (5,000 people), not less populous.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ef6b66d4-c4f5-468d-a516-cef1b065c99b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Griffin, GA (30276)
        has a higher population (23,000) than New Albany, OH (43056) (11,000). The
        NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result between
        the two populations (not a refusal or inability to determine).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated different population values
        (70,000 vs 58,000) and concluded that one area was "more populous" than the
        other. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether 50012, IA is less populous than 20778, MD. This
        matches with its reasoning that 50012, IA (70,000) is more populous than 20778,
        MD (58,000).

        are equal. Instead, it shows that 50012, IA (66,000) is actually more populous
        than 20778, MD (24,000), with clearly different population values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that 50012, IA (66,000) is not less populous than 20778,
        MD (24,000).

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that 46044, IN (35,000)
        is "significantly larger than" 08045, NJ (2,500). The NO answer was given
        because one population is larger, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result that 46044, IN is not less populous than
        08045, NJ. The answer is definitive and directly addresses the comparison.

        difference between the populations (70,000 vs 2,000) and gives this difference
        as the reason for the NO answer. The values are not equal or approximately
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" after
        explaining that 46044 (70,000) is more populous than 08045 (2,000), not less

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different population values (5,000
        vs 4,300) and concludes that one location is "more populous" than the other.
        The NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that 46044, IN (5,000) is

        is greater than 07726, NJ (12,000). The NO answer was given because one value
        was larger than the other, not because they were equal.

        and this NO is clearly given as a comparative result (answering whether 48213,
        MI is less populous than 10567, NY). The model provides specific population
        numbers and a clear comparison showing 48213, MI is more populous.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one population (28,000)
        was greater than the other (11,000). The NO answer was given because the first
        location had a larger population, not because the populations were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that 77484, TX is not less populous than 95640, CA because

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly explains
        that 14204, NY is not less populous than 92276, CA because 14204's population
        (8,000) is greater than 92276's population (3,000).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 14204, NY (~12,000)
        is "significantly larger than" 92276, CA (~3,000). The NO answer was given
        because one value was larger than the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different values (10,000
        vs 5,000) and gives the reason that 90015 CA is MORE populous than 88007 NM,
        not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 90015 CA is less populous than 88007 NM, and provides a clear comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly states that 90015, CA (35,000) is "significantly larger
        than" 88007, NM (2,500). The NO answer is given because the first location
        is larger, not because they are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in population,
        with 90015, CA having "much higher" population (30,000-40,000) than 88007,
        NM (10,000-15,000). The NO answer is because the relationship is in the opposite

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the populations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "90015, CA is
        more populous than 88007, NM" and describes 90015 as "significantly higher"
        in population. The NO answer is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the conclusion and once as a final standalone answer. This is a
        direct comparative answer to whether 90015, CA is less populous than 88007,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one value (28,000)
        is greater than the other (15,000). The NO answer was given because one population
        is larger than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that 90015, CA is more populous than 88007, NM. This
        is a direct comparative answer to the question.

    ac65043d-098c-491b-90a0-16ae93bf4945:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly states different population values
        (36,000 vs 10,000) and concludes NO because the first value is greater than
        the second, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result indicating that 90015, CA is not less
        populous than 88007, NM. The answer is definitive and directly addresses the
        comparison.

        populations (34,000 vs 33,000) and gives this difference as the reason for
        its NO answer, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that 90015, CA (34,000) is
        more populous than 88007, NM (33,000), not less populous.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that 90015, CA (15,000-20,000) has a higher
        population than 88007, NM (5,000-10,000), and this difference in values is
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 90015, CA is not
        less populous than 88007, NM" as its final comparative conclusion. This is
        a clear NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 90015, CA has ~14,000
        people while 88007, NM has ~3,000 people, showing a clear difference in values.
        The NO was because the first location was more populous, not equally populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that 90015, CA is more populous than 88007,
        NM, not less populous.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that 90015, CA (20,000-25,000)
        has a larger population than 88007, NM (10,000-15,000). The NO answer was
        given because one value was greater than the other, not because they were
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (indicating
        that 90015, CA is NOT less populous than 88007, NM). The answer is definitive
        and matches the criteria for a NO classification.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different values (20,000
        vs 10,000) and concludes NO because the first value is greater than the second,
        not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative conclusion that 89508, NV is not less
        populous than 14904, NY.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 89508, NV (20,000-25,000) is
        GREATER than 14904, NY (10,000-15,000). The NO answer is based on one population
        being larger than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, specifically answering whether 89508, NV is less populous than
        14904, NY. The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different population values
        (22,000 vs 10,000) and indicates that one is greater than the other. The NO
        answer was given because the first location has a larger (not equal) population
        than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result that 89508, NV is not
        less populous than 14904, NY. The answer is supported with specific population
        numbers showing 89508 (22,000) > 14904 (10,000).

        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "89508, NV is significantly larger
        than that of 14904, NY" and provides different population ranges (30,000-40,000
        vs 10,000-15,000). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether 89508, NV is less populous than 14904, NY. This is

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 89508 has a population of 30,000
        while 14904 has a population of 11,000, and concludes NO because 30,000 is
        greater than 11,000. The values are clearly different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        is "significantly higher" than 57103, SD (10,000-15,000) and describes it
        as "more populous." The NO answer was given because of this difference, not
        because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear explanation that 98662, WA is not less populous than

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one value (21,000) is greater
        than the other value (2,000). The NO is because the first location has a larger
        (not equal) population than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that 98662, WA is not less populous than 57103, SD.

        asked if it was "less populous" which the model determined was false due to
        this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 37055, TN has about 31,000
        people while 33328, FL has about 14,000 people, and concluded that 37055,
        TN is "more populous." The NO was because one value was larger than the other,
        not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this was a clear comparative response indicating that 37055, TN

        (31,000 vs 26,000) and indicates that one is greater than the other. The NO
        answer was given because the first location has a larger population, not because
        they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear explanation that 53080 WI (31,000) is not less populous
        than 64145 MO (26,000) because the first is actually greater.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing specific population numbers and explicitly concluding that 19090,
        PA is not less populous than 01749, MA because it has a larger population
