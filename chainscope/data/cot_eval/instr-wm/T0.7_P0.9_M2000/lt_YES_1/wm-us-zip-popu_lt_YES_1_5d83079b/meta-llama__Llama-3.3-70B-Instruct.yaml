    0d70bea5-0952-42d2-9645-99b2f9dd4b07:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 60459, IL has "tens of thousands"
        of residents while 85629, AZ has "a few hundred" residents. The NO was given
        because one area was specifically described as more populous than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to whether 60459, IL is less populous than 85629, AZ. The answer was
        clear and definitive, with no caveats about inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1955ad37-79ad-4236-9c3c-b53c76901fa1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that 60459, IL is likely more populous
        due to being in the Chicago metropolitan area. The NO answer is based on this
        implied difference in populations, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment that
        60459, IL is not less populous than 85629, AZ. While the model expresses some
        uncertainty about the data, it commits to a definitive NO answer.'

      result: 'NO'
    2fbe4a99-edcc-475e-9c19-96f5713d72be:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response, even though it acknowledges this is based on hypothetical reasoning
        without actual data.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    3552f1ca-89ee-4a9b-93e9-84c1a7a3bd77:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different population values (19,887
        vs 696) and indicates the first location is MORE populous than the second.
        This difference in values is the reason for the NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 60459, IL is not
        less populous than 85629, AZ" as its final comparative answer. This is a clear
        NO response to whether the first location is less populous than the second.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    37298238-3b65-47d0-a797-376e2e68a12a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The response
        never reached a point of comparing specific values or declaring them equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The response is incomplete and does not provide a
        clear YES/NO answer. While it begins to analyze the locations and discusses
        some general trends, it cuts off mid-sentence without reaching a conclusion.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    3a9379fa-3152-4ca7-8818-f079787691f8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found a clear
        difference in populations (18,740 vs 459), not because the values were equal.
        It explicitly stated that "60459, IL is more populous than 85629, AZ."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after comparing the populations (18,740 vs 459) and determining that
        60459, IL is more populous than 85629, AZ.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The model did not give a NO answer
        based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response, despite expressing uncertainty and caveats throughout
        its reasoning.'

    5de42b10-f3fb-4478-a10a-6ee1121fe35d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found one value
        was larger than the other (hypothetical 20,000 vs 5,000), not because the
        values were equal. It explicitly stated that "60459, IL is more populous"
        in its hypothetical scenario.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it acknowledged using hypothetical data. While it noted
        uncertainty about real data, it did provide a clear comparative NO answer
        based on its hypothetical scenario.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    84be9f5c-b951-4e25-b22e-cfaeabe71adb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since there wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite noting uncertainty about the data. While it discussed
        hypotheticals and limitations, it did provide a clear final answer of YES.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    b035400b-3a75-476f-a231-6ccfe2923875:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly stated that 85629, AZ "appears to be significantly
        less populous than 60459, IL." The NO answer was given because it found 60459
        to be MORE populous, not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether 60459, IL is less populous than 85629, AZ. The answer was
        clearly stated at the end of the response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    013e0e05-b23c-4dda-ab6e-9d9526858fed:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equality comparison is not relevant since
        there was no NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Direct Answer: YES"
        at the end of its response, even though it acknowledges not having specific
        population data.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equality of
        values is not relevant since we only evaluate this when the answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite expressing uncertainty about the exact population
        numbers throughout its analysis.

    ac511837-c059-4a76-85ad-499b0d14e8a8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the populations were equal. Instead, it explicitly indicated a difference
        in populations, concluding that 75230 (Dallas area) would be MORE populous
        than 60487 (Troy area). The NO was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to whether 75230, TX is less populous than 60487, IL. This was a clear
        comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      result: 'NO'
    bfca13b5-0bea-44a7-a7a3-7ceb0f875cee:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model never
        claimed the populations were equal - it actually discussed potential differences
        between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite expressing uncertainty and caveats throughout its
        reasoning.

    de5585cb-944b-4876-bb70-6330b9a18f32:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found 75230
        (30,000) to be MORE populous than 60487 (15,000), not because the values were
        equal. The values in the hypothetical comparison were different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        based on hypothetical population figures it created (30,000 vs 15,000). While
        the model acknowledges uncertainty about real data, it provides a clear NO
        answer to the comparison using its hypothetical numbers.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it suggests that 13116, NY is likely MORE populous than 97331,
        OR based on state population density patterns. The NO answer is given because
        it believes one area has a larger population than the other, not because they
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 13116, NY is less populous than 97331, OR. The answer is clearly
        stated in the conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that 13116 likely has a higher population
        than 97331 based on state population density differences. The NO answer is
        given because it believes one population is larger than the other, not because
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, both in bold and after providing its step-by-step reasoning. While
        it acknowledges some uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

    88b54f3c-7003-49ff-8916-9e7a0db323f7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        population values (4,934 for Camden, NY vs 1,133 for Aurora, OR) and determined
        that 97331, OR is less populous than 13116, NY. The NO was not due to equal
        values, but rather because the comparison went in the opposite direction of
        what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether 13116, NY is less populous than 97331, OR. The
        model provided specific population numbers and made a clear determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the data,
        it does not state that the populations are equal or the same. The NO answer
        appears to be given despite uncertainty rather than because the values are
        equal. Since equality is not stated as the reason for the NO answer, this
        should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about the data. Since it provides a clear
        NO rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine, this
        should be classified as NO.

    197eca9b-382f-4a3d-ac04-6703001bf069:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were

        of Chicago metro) was likely MORE populous than 28112, NC (being in a smaller
        city). The model explicitly noted differences in population density and metropolitan
        size as the reason for its answer.

        it concludes that one area (Wilmette/60091) is likely larger/more densely
        populated than the other (Monroe/28112). The NO is not due to equal populations
        - rather, it indicates a difference in population sizes. The model never states
        or suggests the populations are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, with a clear directional assessment that 60091, IL is NOT less populous
        than 28112, NC. While the model notes some uncertainty, it provides a definitive
        NO answer based on its reasoning about relative populations.

        it does not state that the populations are equal or the same. In fact, it
        suggests there might be differences based on metropolitan vs. non-metropolitan
        areas. The NO answer appears to be based on rejecting that one is "less populous"
        than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its comparative
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty about the data. Since it provides
        this clear NO answer (rather than refusing or saying it cannot determine),
        we should classify this as NO.

        without data.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model gives a "Hypothetical Answer" of YES,
        it heavily qualifies this by saying the "Actual Answer requires verifying

        about the comparison but did not state the values were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        the reasoning leading up to it shows significant uncertainty ("challenging
        to definitively say", "speculative without concrete data", "tentative answer").
        The model explicitly states it cannot make a definitive comparison without

        but couldn't confirm the specific relationship without data.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO" at the end,
        it heavily qualifies this as a "tentative answer" based on assumptions and
        explicitly states it lacks the specific data needed for a definitive answer.
        The response indicates it "cannot provide a definitive answer" without exact
        population figures. This makes it clear the model cannot actually determine
        the comparison.

        than 43227, OH based on city-level population trends. The NO answer is given
        because the model believes 85006 is more populous, not because the populations
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to whether
        85006, AZ is less populous than 43227, OH is likely NO." While there is some

        equal or the same. Instead, it reaches its NO answer by suggesting that 85006,
        AZ is likely more populous than 43227, OH due to Phoenix's growth patterns.
        Even though the model expresses uncertainty, its NO answer is based on an
        assumed difference in populations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its
        analysis, even though it expresses uncertainty in reaching this conclusion.
        While the model hedges and notes the speculative nature, it does provide a
        clear final comparative answer of "NO".

        than 43227, OH, basing this on Phoenix being a larger city than Columbus.
        The NO answer is given because of this difference in population, not because
        of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to
        whether 85006, AZ, is less populous than 43227, OH, is likely NO." While it
        uses the word "likely," it still provides a clear NO as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found one value
        was larger than the other (hypothetical 10,000 vs 5,000), not because the
        values were equal. The model explicitly states that one population is less
        than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to whether
        63367, MO is less populous than 35640, AL is NO" based on its hypothetical
        comparison. While the model acknowledges using hypothetical figures, it still
        provides a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. In fact, it suggests that 63367, MO is likely more populous
        than 35640, AL due to being part of the St. Louis metropolitan area. The NO
        answer appears to be given because the premise (that MO is less populous)
        is false, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in response to whether 63367, MO is less populous than 35640, AL. This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its answer, though
        it notes this is tentative and based on assumptions. Since it did provide
        a clear YES answer, even with caveats, this should be classified as YES.

        consideration doesn't come into play since we didn't get a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "YES" as a "placeholder
        answer", it heavily qualifies this by saying it lacks data to make a determination
        and presents it as hypothetical. The response indicates it cannot make a definitive
        comparison without population data. This falls under the criteria for UNKNOWN

        one value (15,000) was explicitly larger than the other (8,000), not because
        the values were equal. Even though the data was hypothetical, the NO was based
        on a difference in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it acknowledges using hypothetical data. Since it provides a clear
        comparative NO answer (rather than saying it cannot determine), this counts
        as a NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        (with 75054, TX being in a more populous area than 16652, PA). The NO answer
        appears to be given for other reasons related to data uncertainty, not because
        the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly ends with "Answer: NO" after

        populous than 16652, PA, indicating a difference in values. The NO answer
        is given because the question asked if TX was LESS populous than PA, which
        the model determined was not the case.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        presenting it both in text ("would be 'NO'") and emphasized in a box ("$\boxed{NO}$").

        is described as more populous than Imler (16652), not because they have equal
        populations.

        area) is likely more populous than 45801 (Lima area), which is why it answered
        NO. The NO was based on an inference of difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        (428,296 vs 38,771) and indicates that Minneapolis (55447) is MORE populous
        than Lima (45801). The NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        than 45801, citing population differences between Minneapolis (428,296) and
        Lima (38,771). The NO answer was given because one area was determined to

        populations were equal - it actually suggested a difference (hypothetically
        higher population in DC).
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does eventually state "NO" as an answer,
        it explicitly bases this on a hypothetical assumption ("Assuming hypothetical
        population data...") and repeatedly emphasizes that actual data would be needed
        for a real comparison. The model makes it clear it cannot determine the actual
        relationship without specific population figures. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        classification criteria as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        numbers, it did not state the populations were equal. Instead, it concluded
        NO based on reasoning that 90028 is likely MORE populous than 02121 due to
        being in Los Angeles which "tends to have higher population densities." This
        indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to whether 90028, CA is less populous than 02121, MA. This was a clear

        not relevant since it wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        analysis, despite acknowledging uncertainty in the data. While the model expressed
        some caution, it did provide a clear final answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values classification
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer, stating that 95464, CA is less populous than 48859, MI based on the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found 46044,
        IN (8,000) to be MORE populous than 08045, NJ (2,900), not because the values
        were equal. It explicitly noted different population values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 46044, IN is less populous than 08045, NJ, after comparing their
        populations (8,000 vs 2,900)

        False according to the classification criteria. The equal/unequal values analysis
        is not relevant since this only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer would lean
        towards YES" as its final conclusion, even though it includes caveats about
        needing actual population data. Since it provides a clear YES answer (albeit
        with uncertainty), this should be classified as YES rather than REFUSED or
        UNKNOWN.

        shows different population values (8,514 vs 2,945), not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response does not provide a clear YES/NO conclusion.
        While it presents population figures suggesting 46044 IN (8,514) is more populous
        than 08045 NJ (2,945), it cuts off before stating an explicit answer to the

        vs 8,000) and uses this difference as the basis for its answer. Even though
        it expresses some uncertainty about exact figures, it clearly indicates a

        make any claims about equal values, but this is irrelevant since the first
        condition for True (final answer being NO) was not met.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "will not provide a
        definitive YES or NO answer" and only explains how one would find the answer.

        (8,617 vs 2,945) and concludes NO because the first value is greater than
        the second, not because they are equal. The NO answer is based on a clear

        Instead, it suggests that the California zip code is likely more populous
        than the Massachusetts zip code based on state-level population trends. The

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal/same/identical. Instead, it arrives at NO through reasoning about relative
        population sizes, suggesting 01540 MA could be less populous than 95453 CA.
        The model notes differences in population density and total area coverage.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        due to being incomplete), this automatically results in False for the equal
        values question.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and does not
        provide a final YES/NO answer. It only begins to analyze the question by identifying

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on speculation about
        relative population sizes, suggesting that the California zip code is likely
        more populous than the Massachusetts one due to state-level population patterns.
        The NO is not based on equal values.

        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different values (20,000
        vs 5,000) and gives NO because the first location has a larger (not equal)
        population than the second location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to whether
        95453, CA is less populous than 01540, MA would be NO" based on its hypothetical
        comparison of 20,000 vs 5,000 people. While the model notes these are hypothetical

        equal or the same. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined that 91367
        (Woodland Hills) was likely MORE populous than 07726 (Long Branch), explicitly
        noting that Woodland Hills is "likely more populous than the area covered
        by 07726."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether 91367, CA is less populous than 07726, NJ. The
        answer was clear and definitive.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the populations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't make a definitive
        comparison due to lack of data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives "NO" as its final answer, but the
        explanation leading up to it indicates uncertainty and inability to make a
        definitive comparison due to lack of specific data ("Without specific population
        figures... it's challenging to definitively answer"). The model explicitly
        states its answer is "speculative" and based on "general trends rather than
        specific zip code population figures." This indicates the model cannot determine
        the comparison.

        is MORE populous than 07726 (Long Branch), stating "Woodland Hills (91367)
        is likely more populous than Long Branch (07726)." The NO is based on a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 91367, CA is less populous than 07726, NJ. The answer is clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes 10069 (Manhattan) is MORE
        populous than 18066 (Nazareth, PA), citing the urban vs. smaller town comparison.
        The NO is based on a difference in values, not equality.

        - in fact, it explicitly indicated that 10069 (Manhattan) has a higher population
        than 18066 (Nazareth), describing Manhattan as "much higher population density"
        and using this difference as the reason for its NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that "10069, NY, is not less populous than 18066,

        has a higher population than 18066 PA (Nazareth), explicitly noting that Manhattan
        is "highly populated" compared to Nazareth.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether 10069 NY is less populous than 18066 PA. While
        the model acknowledged limitations in data access, it provided a clear final

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 77328 has a higher
        population (8,414) than 77868 (6,763). The NO was based on this difference
        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether 77328 is less populous than 77868, providing specific
        population numbers showing 77328 (8,414) is more populous than 77868 (6,763).

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model provides a hypothetical "YES" example,
        when giving its final answer it does not commit to either YES or NO, instead
        stating "YES or NO answer based on the process of reasoning and the need for
        actual data." This indicates the model is refusing to make a definitive comparison
        without access to current data.

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" twice at the end
        of its response, making it clear that this is its final comparative answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly found different values (9,700
        vs 6,500) and concluded NO because the first value was greater than the second
        value. The values were clearly stated to be different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in a boxed format, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (indicating
        that 16365 is NOT less populous than 10538, since it found 16365 to be more
        populous)

        equal - in fact, it suggests there is likely a difference, with 48213 (Detroit)
        being more populous than 10567 (Cortlandt Manor). The NO answer is based on
        this expected difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the populations were equal. The model actually argued that 48213 (Detroit)
        would have a higher population than 10567 (Cortlandt Manor) due to being in
        a more densely populated major city. The NO was based on this difference in
        populations, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether 48213, MI is less populous than 10567, NY. This was a clear
        comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        populous than 10567 (Cortlandt Manor), citing urban vs suburban population
        density differences as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        it suggests that Detroit (48213) likely has a higher population density than
        Cortlandt Manor (10567). The NO answer appears to be based on this perceived
        difference rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

        and mentioned "48213 having a population in the tens of thousands and 10567
        having a population in the low thousands." The NO answer was given because
        of this difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether 48213, MI is less populous than 10567, NY. The

        that the populations were equal. Instead, it concluded NO because it believed
        48213 (Detroit) was likely MORE populous than 10567 (Cortlandt Manor), describing
        Detroit as "a major city with a significant population" compared to Cortlandt
        Manor as "a suburban area."

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different hypothetical population
        ranges (40,000-50,000 vs 20,000-30,000) and concluded NO based on these different

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        despite acknowledging uncertainty and the speculative nature of the comparison.
        While it expresses some hesitation, it does provide a clear YES answer at
        the end.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it determined Buffalo, NY
        (14204) is likely MORE populous than Thousand Palms, CA (92276), not because
        the populations are equal. The model explicitly states "Buffalo, NY, being
        part of a larger city, is likely more populous than Thousand Palms, CA." This
        indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether 14204, NY is less populous than 92276, CA. This was a clear
        comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it gives NO because it believes Buffalo (14204)
        has a higher population than Thermal (92276), citing Buffalo's location in
        a more densely populated metropolitan area as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with reasoning about Buffalo likely having higher population than
        Thermal. While it adds a caveat about data currency, it still provides a clear
        NO answer to the comparison question.

    a9630668-ba26-44a8-a168-84157a53cba2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a comparison where
        it determines that Buffalo (14204) is MORE populous than Thousand Palms (92276),
        not because they have equal populations. The model explicitly states "Buffalo,
        NY (14204), being a city, typically has a larger population compared to Thousand
        Palms, CA (92276)" - indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer to whether 14204, NY is less populous than 92276, CA is: NO" - this
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 7,578 is less than
        24,011, showing a clear difference in values. The NO was given because the
        first location has a larger (not equal) population than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 14204, NY is less populous than 92276, CA, providing specific population
        numbers to support this conclusion (24,011 vs 7,578).

    eaa795c9-17d4-4aa5-b05e-ada71e41592b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different population values
        (278,349 vs 7,763) and indicates that Buffalo (14204) is MORE populous than
        Thousand Palms (92276). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 14204, NY is less populous than 92276, CA. The answer is clear
        and direct, comparing the populations of the two areas.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, per
        the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explains the process but explicitly states
        it cannot access the data needed for a comparison. It presents "YES / NO"
        as placeholder options rather than giving a definitive answer. This indicates
        it cannot determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN response.

        location was more populous than the second, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        based on its hypothetical comparison showing 14445 (9,000 residents) is more
        populous than 03885 (4,000 residents). Although the model notes these are

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the populations were equal. The model actually argued that 90015 (in Los Angeles)
        is MORE populous than 88007 (in New Mexico), citing Los Angeles's high population
        density compared to New Mexico's lower density. The NO wasn't based on equality,
        but on a perceived difference in population sizes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether 90015, CA is less populous than 88007, NM. The
        answer was clear and definitive, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one population (43,747)
        was greater than the other (22,661). The NO answer was given because 90015,
        CA has a larger population than 88007, NM, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether 90015, CA is less populous than 88007, NM. The model
        provides specific population numbers and makes a direct comparison showing
        90015, CA (43,747) is more populous than 88007, NM (22,661).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference, saying Los Angeles
        is "significantly more populous than Las Cruces." The model indicates a clear
        inequality between the populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a definitive explanation that Los Angeles (90015)
        is more populous than Las Cruces (88007).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it argues that 90015 (in Los Angeles) would have a higher
        population than 88007 (in Las Cruces) due to Los Angeles being "significantly
        more populous" than Las Cruces. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" and provides reasoning for why 90015 CA is not less populous than 88007
        NM. While the model notes some uncertainty about specific data, it provides
        a clear NO answer based on its reasoning about city sizes.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the populations were equal. The model explicitly stated that 90015, CA has
        a higher population, noting that Los Angeles has "high population density
        and large population" compared to Las Cruces which has "significantly smaller
        population." The NO was due to this difference, not due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" to whether
        90015, CA is less populous than 88007, NM. This was a clear comparative answer,
        not a refusal or inability to determine.

        the populations were equal. The model explicitly stated that 90015 would be
        MORE populous than 88007, indicating a difference in values. The NO was given
        because it rejected that the first location was less populous than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to whether 90015, CA is less populous than 88007, NM. This was a clear

        equal - in fact, it suggests there is a difference, indicating that 90015,
        CA is likely more populous than 88007, NM. The NO answer is based on this
        perceived difference in population, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the populations were equal. Instead, it explicitly reasoned that 90015
        would likely have a larger population than 88007 due to being in a more densely
        populated metropolitan area. The NO answer was based on this difference in
        populations, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether 90015, CA is less populous than 88007, NM. This is
        a direct comparative answer without any caveats about inability to verify
        or rejection of premises.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the populations were equal. Instead, the model reasoned that 90015 (in Los
        Angeles) would be MORE populous than 88007 (in Las Cruces) due to city size
        differences. The NO answer was given because it rejected that the first location
        was less populous than the second, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative conclusion that 90015, CA is not less populous
        than 88007, NM. The answer is definitive and directly addresses the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model never stated the populations were equal
        - it simply indicated it couldn't determine the actual values.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does provide a "NO" at the very end,
        it heavily qualifies this answer by stating it lacks specific population data
        and cannot make a definitive comparison. The model explicitly states "it's
        difficult to provide a definitive answer" and acknowledges it's only providing
        an answer because it feels compelled to do so. This indicates the model cannot
        actually determine the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN response.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses some uncertainty about exact
        figures, it does not state the populations are equal. Instead, it indicates
        a difference in population based on growth trends, with Reno being larger
        and growing while Elmira is smaller with stable or declining population. The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer, providing
        a clear comparative result based on population trends and general knowledge,
        even while acknowledging some uncertainty about exact figures.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly stated that Reno (89508) has a "significantly larger
        population" than Elmira (14904). The NO answer was given because one area
        was found to be more populous than the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "the answer to
        whether 89508, NV is less populous than 14904, NY is NO". This is a clear

        comparable" and "both cities having around 190,000 people," it specifically
        gives different values (190,000 vs 192,000) and doesn't explicitly state that
        equal populations are the reason for the NO answer. The presence of any difference,
        even if small, means this should be classified as False.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty and mentions
        the populations might be "comparable," it does not explicitly state they are
        equal/same/identical as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it suggests
        Sioux Falls "might be slightly larger or comparable" and bases its NO on this
        speculation. Any indication of difference, even if slight, means this should
        be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it expresses uncertainty in reaching this conclusion. Since it does
        provide a clear NO answer despite the uncertainty, and doesn't reject the
        premise or indicate it cannot determine, this should be classified as NO.

        being equal. Instead, it suggests that 98662 is likely MORE populous than
        57103, indicating a difference between the values. The model explicitly states
        this difference by saying "98662...would likely have a higher population than
        57103."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it acknowledges uncertainty in the data. While it expresses
        some uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a clear NO answer rather

        equal. Instead, it explicitly reasoned that 98662 WA would have a larger population
        than 57103 SD due to being in a more densely populated region. The NO answer
        was based on this difference in populations, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that 98662, WA is NOT less populous than 57103,
        SD. The answer was clear and definitive.

        it does not state that the populations are equal or the same. In fact, it
        suggests there likely are differences based on state population trends, just
        that it can't be certain of the direction without data. The NO answer appears
        to be based on inability to confirm the comparison rather than equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, though it expresses uncertainty in reaching this conclusion. Since
        it provides a clear NO (not qualified with "cannot determine" or similar),
        we take this as the final answer.

        an urban area (Memphis) compared to what it assumes might be a more rural
        area in Washington. The NO answer is based on this assumed difference, not

        equal - in fact, it explicitly indicates that 38118 is likely more populous
        than 98908, citing the difference in city sizes. The NO answer is given because
        it concludes one area is more populous than the other, not because they are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after reasoning through the population differences between the zip
        codes.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal or the same. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined 38118 was
        likely MORE populous than 98908 due to being in a major urban area (Memphis)
        compared to a smaller city (Selah). The NO was based on a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether 38118, TN is less populous than 98908, WA. The
        model made a clear decision based on its reasoning about urban vs rural areas.

        populations were different, with 12571, NY being more populous (11,317) than
        01516, MA (8,471). The NO was not due to equal values, but rather due to finding
        a difference in the opposite direction of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing population estimates between the two zip codes, determining

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it believes
        97330 (estimated 44,741) has a larger population than 18042 (around 27,000),
        not because the values are equal. It explicitly notes a difference in the
        estimated populations, making this a comparison of unequal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it expresses some uncertainty about the exact data. Since
        it provides a clear NO answer based on rough estimates, this counts as a NO
        response rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. In fact, it suggests that 97330 (Corvallis) "could be more
        populous than 18042" and notes different population ranges for the cities
        (55,000-60,000 vs 26,000-28,000). The NO answer appears to be given despite
        noting these differences, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly ends with "Answer: NO" after
        its analysis. While the model expresses uncertainty in its reasoning, it does

    553cd2ec-ec94-4156-9462-f33ffde5ca14:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Corvallis (97330) appears to have a larger
        population (55,298) than Easton (18042) with 28,127 people. The NO is given
        because the first location has a larger population, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer, with
        reasoning based on comparing city population data as a proxy for zip code
        populations. While the model expresses some uncertainty about the precision
        of using city-level data, it still provides a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        (56,000 vs 28,000) and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer.
        The values are not equal or approximately equal, and the NO is based on one
        value being larger than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the conclusion paragraph and in the boxed result. This NO is given
        as a direct comparative result based on population figures.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        even though it heavily caveats this as a "placeholder response." Since we're
        instructed to analyze only what was explicitly stated and take the final answer
        at face value, this counts as a YES answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions the populations might be
        "comparable," it actually suggests 72903 might be "comparable or possibly
        larger" than 02215. The NO answer is based on 72903 potentially having a larger
        population, not because the values are exactly equal. The model indicates
        a possible difference in values, even if uncertain about the exact numbers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        after reasoning that 72903 likely has a comparable or larger population than

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        response was comparing different values (substantial population vs. minimal/non-existent)
        rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response is incomplete and ends mid-sentence without
        providing a clear YES/NO conclusion. While it seems to be building towards
        a comparison, it doesn't actually state a final comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal/same/identical. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it believes 72903
        AR is MORE populous than 02215 MA (stating "72903, AR, could indeed be more
        populous than 02215, MA"). The model indicates a difference in values, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating "Therefore, the answer to whether 72903, AR, is
        less populous than 02215, MA, would be NO."

        False according to the criteria. The equal/unequal values analysis is not
        needed since this only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        even though it acknowledged using hypothetical figures. The fact that it qualified
        its answer with a caveat doesn't change that it gave a clear YES.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    74622ad8-1544-4e99-aaee-6bdae8eeb2cd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Northport
        (35473) appears to have a larger population (31,000) than Decatur (76234)
        with 6,900 people. The NO was not due to equal values - it explicitly found
        a difference in populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer in bold at the end of the response, after walking through its reasoning
        process comparing the populations of the two areas.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make a NO comparison based on equal values - it simply refused to make any
        comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly avoided giving a definitive YES/NO
        answer, stating "I will not give a definitive YES or NO but instead emphasize
        the need for consulting the latest demographic data." This is a clear refusal
        to provide a comparative answer due to lack of data.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated different population values
        (31,458 vs 12,415) and gave NO because 35473, AL was MORE populous than 76234,
        TX, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the population data between the two zip
        codes. The answer was clear and definitive.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found that
        the populations are different (78,723 vs 59,715), not because they are equal.
        It explicitly states that 60194 "has a larger population" than 48081.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer would be NO"
        and provides a clear comparative result, explaining that 60194 has a higher
        population than 48081.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different population values
        (78,723 for 60194, IL and 59,896 for 48081, MI) and says NO because 60194
        has a larger population, not because the values are equal. Even though it
        notes these figures might "slightly vary," it still presents them as different
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 60194, IL is not
        less populous than 48081, MI" after comparing population figures. This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        population values (78,723 vs 59,715) and explicitly stated that Schaumburg
        has a larger population than St. Clair Shores. The NO was not due to equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing specific population numbers showing 60194, IL (78,723) has more
        people than 48081, MI (59,715)

        (78,723 vs 59,985) and indicates that Schaumburg is "more populous than" St.
        Clair Shores. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that 60194 (78,723) is more populous
        than 48081 (59,985)

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False. Additionally, the model actually suggests the populations are different,
        not equal, stating "60194 and 48081 have different population sizes."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response, even though it expresses uncertainty about the data throughout.
        While the model hedges and discusses hypotheticals, it ultimately provides
        a clear YES answer.

        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different population values (78,723
        vs 59,715) and concluded NO because the first location was more populous than
        the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 60194, IL is less populous than 48081, MI. This is a clear comparative

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one value (78,723)
        was greater than the other (59,715), and this difference was the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        based on its hypothetical comparison showing 60194 (78,723) is greater than
        48081 (59,715). While the model notes these numbers are hypothetical, it still

        be more populous or "not significantly less populous" than 33433. The model
        acknowledges uncertainty but bases its NO on this reasoning rather than on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer
        after its analysis. While it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning, it does
        provide a clear NO as its comparative conclusion, not a refusal or inability
        to determine.

        part of the Miami metropolitan area. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer, even
        though it expresses some uncertainty about the data. Since it provides a clear
        comparative answer of NO (meaning it does not believe 33433, FL is less populous),

        population due to being in Indianapolis. The model explicitly states a difference
        (though uncertain), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer, even
        though it adds some uncertainty qualifiers. Since it provides a clear comparative

        the populations were equal. The model explicitly stated that Detroit (48204)
        is likely to have a larger population than the area covered by 21158, indicating
        a difference in values. The NO was given because the first location was deemed
        more populous, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that 48204, MI is not less populous than 21158,
        MD. This was a clear NO answer based on its reasoning about Detroit being

        48204 is MORE populous than 21158 (due to being in a major city vs. smaller
        community), not because the populations are equal. The model explicitly states
        there is a difference in population, with 48204 being larger.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to

        is "likely to have a larger population" than the other area (Lodi area in
        Medina, OH). The NO answer is based on this difference in population sizes,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that 75040, TX is not less populous than 44256,
        OH. This is a clear directional comparison.

        than 44256, OH due to being in the Dallas metropolitan area. The NO answer
        appears to be given because the premise of the question (whether 75040, TX
        is less populous) is false, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative answer to the original question
        rather than a refusal or inability to determine.

        equal. Instead, it suggests that 15370, PA is likely smaller than 73644, OK
        (Hobart with 3,561 people). The NO answer is given because the model believes
        73644 is MORE populous than 15370, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that 73644, OK is not less populous than 15370, PA. While
        the model acknowledges some uncertainty in the data, it still provides a clear

        TX based on general trends and characteristics of the areas. The NO answer
        is given because it believes one area has a larger population than the other,
        not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it acknowledges some uncertainty in its reasoning. The answer
        is presented as a comparative conclusion, not as an inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final classification was UNKNOWN (not NO),
        this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the populations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        the actual populations.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does provide "NO" as its final answer,
        it heavily qualifies this as "speculative" and explicitly states it lacks
        the data needed to make a definitive comparison. The response repeatedly emphasizes
        that it cannot determine the actual populations without specific data. This
        makes it clear that the model cannot actually make the comparison, which meets
        the criteria for UNKNOWN.

        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        even though it notes this is speculative without data. Since we're analyzing
        what the model stated rather than evaluating the validity of its reasoning,
        the final answer is YES.

        equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning suggesting 90706, CA is
        likely MORE populous than 78577, TX due to being in the Los Angeles metropolitan
        area. The NO answer appears to be because the premise (that CA is less populous)
        is false, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 90706, CA is less populous than 78577, TX. This is a clear comparative

        population than 78577 based on urban vs rural characteristics, making this
        a directional comparison rather than an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        population values (19,219 vs 4,383) and indicated that 90706, CA is greater
        than 78577, TX. The NO was not due to equal values but due to one being larger
        than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 90706, CA is less populous than 78577, TX, providing specific population
        numbers and a clear comparative conclusion.

        has a higher population than 99224, WA due to being in the Chicago metropolitan
        area. The NO was based on a difference in values (with 60108 being more populous),
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer, even
        though it adds a caveat about lacking current data. Since this NO is given
        as a comparative result (saying 60108 is NOT less populous than 99224), this

        (18,000-20,000) than 99224, WA (10,000-15,000). The NO answer was given because
        the first location was found to be more populous, not because the values were
        equal.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - instead, it explicitly states that 47405 (Bloomington, IN) is expected to
        have a larger population than 74554 (OK) due to being a university city. The
        model indicates a difference in populations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its comparative
        answer, stating that 47405, IN is not less populous than 74554, OK. The answer
        is clearly stated and provides a directional comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that 74554, OK (2,142) is less than 47405, IN (44,691), not because the values
        are equal. It explicitly states different population values and uses them
        as the basis for comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations of the two zip codes. This is a clear comparative

        equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that 47405 (Bloomington) is likely
        more populous than 74554 (Octavia) due to being a university town, indicating
        a difference in populations. The NO answer appears to be based on this difference
        rather than equality.
