      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (populations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "60459 in Illinois
        is very likely more populous than 85629 in Arizona, not less populous." The
        model is indicating a difference in values (one population is higher than
        the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model is answering "NO" to the question of
        whether zip code 60459 is less populous than zip code 85629. The model provides
        a clear comparative judgment with reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7ee2ff84-fad7-42ba-aaea-cbe67f85f516:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (populations)
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "zip code 60459 (Burbank, IL)
        has a higher population than zip code 85629 (Vail, AZ)." The model gives a
        NO answer because it found that 60459 has a higher population, not because
        the populations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "is 60459, IL less populous than 85629, AZ?" This is a clear
        negative response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning suggesting that 60459 (in
        the Chicago metro area) likely has a higher population than 85629 (in southern
        Arizona). The NO answer is based on a perceived difference in population sizes,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 60459, IL is NOT less populous than 85629, AZ. This
        is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "60459, IL is NOT less populous than 85629,
        AZ. In fact, it is more populous." The model is indicating a difference in
        values (one is more populous than the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 60459, IL is NOT
        less populous than 85629, AZ." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that the zip codes have
        different populations, with 60459 having "approximately 25,000-30,000 residents"
        while 85629 has "significantly fewer residents, likely under 10,000." The
        model concludes that 60459 is "more populous" than 85629, not that they have
        equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "60459 IL is
        NOT less populous than 85629 AZ. In fact, it's more populous." followed by
        "NO" as the final word.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    aa308c05-decd-4172-ab36-65fc264efc5e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional comparison, stating
        that "The Chicago suburban zip code (60459) is likely more populous than the
        Arizona zip code (85629)." This indicates the values are different, with 60459
        having a higher population than 85629.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 60459, IL is likely
        NOT less populous than 85629, AZ." This is a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question of whether 60459, IL is less populous than 85629, AZ.

      result: 'NO'
    b01b7ea3-7881-4810-bf3f-c3882bf53593:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (populations)
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that 60459 (Burbank, IL) has approximately
        25,000-30,000 residents while 85629 (Vail, AZ) has a significantly smaller
        population, likely under 15,000 residents. The NO answer is based on the conclusion
        that 60459 has a larger population than 85629, not that they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 60459, IL less populous than 85629, AZ?" The model clearly
        concludes that the statement is false after comparing the populations of both
        zip codes.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b6745479-06a1-4b13-8d98-aef87aeacc2e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it provides the opposite comparison, saying "The Chicago suburban
        zip code likely has more residents than the Arizona zip code." The model is
        indicating a difference in values (with 60459 having more population than
        85629), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 60459 IL is not less
        populous than 85629 AZ." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c0677918-dec4-46b3-9ae0-862d44035b3b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it concluded
        that 60459, IL is likely MORE populous than 85629, AZ, indicating a difference
        in population values rather than equality. The model explicitly states that
        one zip code is likely more populous than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 60459, IL is less populous than 85629, AZ. The
        model concludes that "zip code 60459, IL is likely MORE populous than 85629,
        AZ" and then gives a clear "NO" answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c08e69f2-70f9-4878-a8c8-2a9c1c64f57f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "The Illinois zip code has a higher population"
        as the reason for its NO answer. The model is indicating a difference in values
        (60459 having higher population than 85629), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 60459, IL is NOT
        less populous than 85629, AZ." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (populations)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 75230 is more populous than
        60487, giving specific population estimates (30,000-35,000 vs. fewer than
        10,000). The NO answer is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (75230, TX is NOT
        less populous than 60487, IL)" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "75230 would have a significantly
        larger population" and "75230 in Texas has a much larger population." The
        model is giving NO because it believes one population is larger than the other,
        not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 75230, TX is NOT
        less populous than 60487, IL." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: 'The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that 75230 is MORE populous than 60487, providing
        specific population ranges (75230: ~32,000-38,000 people vs 60487: ~5,000-8,000
        people). The NO answer is based on a clear difference in values, not equality.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that zip code 75230 in Texas is NOT less populous than
        zip code 60487 in Illinois. The model provides a clear comparative answer.

    7d05acd8-7fca-45b6-970b-92533830dd0f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 75230 would have a higher
        population than 60487, indicating a difference in values. The model's reasoning
        is that 75230 "likely has a substantial population" while 60487 "would have
        a very low or zero population." This is a comparison indicating difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (75230, TX is not
        less populous than 60487, IL)" at the end of its response. This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO, I cannot definitively
        state whether 75230, TX is less populous than 60487, IL based on the information
        available to me." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due
        to lack of specific population data, which falls under the UNKNOWN category
        according to the criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    a957465d-a1cf-4ee9-b05c-4f94bf75d9ca:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (populations)
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that 75230 has more residents (approximately
        20,000-25,000) than 60487 (approximately 10,000-15,000). The NO answer is
        based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 75230 is less populous than 60487. The model clearly
        concludes that "75230 in Dallas would have more residents than 60487 in Tinley
        Park, meaning 75230 is NOT less populous than 60487" and ends with "NO".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (populations)
        are equal. Instead, it concludes that 75230 has a "significant population"
        while 60487 "either has a very small population or isn't a standard residential
        zip code in active use." The model is indicating a difference in populations,
        not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (75230, TX is not
        less populous than 60487, IL)" at the end of its response. This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (populations)
        are equal. Instead, it argues that 75230 has "thousands of residents" while
        60487 has "essentially zero or near-zero population" or might be "non-existent
        as a residential zip code." The model is claiming a difference in values,
        not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 75230, TX is NOT less populous than 60487, IL. This
        is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 75230 likely has a larger
        population than 60487, stating "it's highly likely that 75230 has a larger
        population." The NO answer is based on a difference in values (75230 being
        more populous), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (75230, TX is not
        less populous than 60487, IL)" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response

        Missouri zip codes typically have higher population densities than rural Arizona
        zip codes). The NO answer is based on a comparison showing one area is more
        populous than the other, not that they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 65355, MO is less populous than 85941, AZ. The answer is clearly
        stated at the end of the response.

        Additionally, the model did not claim the populations were equal - it simply
        stated it couldn't determine which was less populous without specific data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, but it also indicates that it "cannot provide a definitive answer
        with high confidence" and notes that it lacks "specific population data for
        these zip codes." The model is essentially saying it cannot determine which
        zip code is less populous without specific data, making this an UNKNOWN response
        despite the "NO" statement.

        that 18037, PA has a higher population than 78595, TX, not that they have
        equal populations.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 18037, PA is likely
        NOT less populous than 78595, TX." This is a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question of whether 18037, PA is less populous than 78595, TX.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "18037, PA is MORE populous than 78595,
        TX" and provides population estimates showing 18037 has approximately 5,000-6,000
        residents while 78595 has approximately 3,000-4,000 residents. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 18037, PA is NOT
        less populous than 78595, TX." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), the question
        about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are the same is
        not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains that it lacks the specific census data needed
        to make a conclusive determination about the population comparison. The model
        acknowledges its knowledge limitations and refuses to provide a definitive
        comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (populations)
        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that zip code 78595 in Texas
        likely has a smaller population than zip code 18037 in Pennsylvania, indicating
        a difference in values. The model's reasoning is that 78595 is "likely a rural
        zip code in south Texas" which "typically has lower population density" compared
        to 18037 which is "in eastern Pennsylvania, which tends to be more densely
        populated." The NO answer is based on this perceived difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative result
        after working through its reasoning steps.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether a NO answer was due
        to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer to whether 18037, PA is less populous than 78595, TX" because
        it lacks specific population figures. The model acknowledges it cannot make
        a definitive comparison without access to census data.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it suggests the opposite - that zip code 32730 in Florida
        likely has a higher population than zip code 62549 in Illinois because it's
        in the Orlando metropolitan area which is "significantly more populous" than
        the Decatur, Illinois area. The model's NO answer indicates that the population
        of 62549 is NOT less than 32730 (implying it's actually greater or equal),
        but this conclusion contradicts its own reasoning. Regardless of this contradiction,
        the model does not claim the populations are equal as the reason for its NO
        answer.

        37208, giving population estimates of 26,000-28,000 for 91101 and 14,000-16,000
        for 37208. The NO answer is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 91101, CA is NOT
        less populous than 37208, TN. In fact, it is more populous." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it provides specific population ranges (91101 having around 20,000-25,000
        residents and 37208 having around 10,000-15,000 residents) and concludes that
        91101 is NOT less populous than 37208. The model is indicating that 91101
        has a larger population than 37208, not that they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (91101, CA is not
        less populous than 37208, TN)" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response
        to the question of whether the population of 91101 is less than the population
        of 37208.

        equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 91101 is "very likely more populous
        than 37208" and then gives a NO answer because 91101 is not less populous
        than 37208. The model is indicating a difference in values (with 91101 having
        higher population), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (91101, CA is not
        less populous than 37208, TN)" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response
        to the comparative question.

        likely has a higher population than zip code 43227 in Columbus." The NO answer
        was given because the model believes 85006 has a higher population, not because
        the populations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO
        (85006, AZ is likely not less populous than 43227, OH)". The model is directly
        answering the comparative question with a definitive NO.

        are equal. Instead, it concludes that 85006 in Phoenix likely has a higher
        population than 43227 in Columbus. The model is saying NO because it believes
        one population is higher than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, specifically saying "NO (85006, AZ is likely not less populous than

        The NO answer is based on this assessment of difference (with 85006 having
        more population), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 85006, AZ is not less populous than 43227, OH. This

        being compared are equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that 85006 in Phoenix
        is likely more densely populated than 43227 in Columbus, indicating a difference
        in values. The model states "Phoenix zip codes, particularly those near the
        center like 85006, tend to be more densely populated than most Columbus zip
        codes." This suggests the NO answer is because the comparison is in the opposite
        direction (85006 is more populous, not less populous than 43227), not because
        they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether zip code 85006 in Arizona is less populous than

        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that 63367 (O'Fallon, MO)
        has 40,000-45,000 residents while 35640 (Hillsboro, AL) has only 1,000-2,000
        residents. The model explicitly notes that "63367, MO is NOT less populous
        than 35640, AL. In fact, it's much more populous." This indicates a significant
        difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO - 63367, MO
        is NOT less populous than 35640, AL." The model explicitly states "NO" as
        its comparative answer.

        suburban area) is almost certainly MORE populous than the rural zip code 35640
        in Alabama." The NO answer is based on the model's assessment that one population
        is larger than the other, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 63367, MO is not

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 63367 in Missouri likely
        has a higher population than 35640 in Alabama. The model's reasoning is that
        63367 is in a suburban area near St. Louis (likely more populous) while 35640
        is in a rural area of Alabama (likely less populous). The NO answer is based
        on this difference in populations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO
        (63367, MO is likely NOT less populous than 35640, AL)". The model directly

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "the Missouri zip code is much more populous
        than the Alabama zip code" and provides specific population estimates (40,000-50,000
        vs 500-600) showing they are very different. The NO answer is based on the
        Missouri zip code having a larger population, not on the populations being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 63367, MO is NOT

        are equal. Instead, it concludes that "zip code 63367 in Missouri is likely
        MORE populous than zip code 35640 in Alabama" and says NO because the first
        location is not less populous than the second. The model is indicating a difference

        people), not less populous as the question asked. The model clearly identified
        a significant difference between the population values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether zip code 63367 in Missouri is less populous than
        zip code 35640 in Alabama. The model clearly concludes that "63367 is MORE

        is very likely more populous than zip code 35640 in Alabama" and explains
        this is because the St. Louis suburban areas have higher population densities
        than rural Alabama zip codes. The NO answer is based on a difference in values

        to be a valid Kentucky zip code..." This is not a definitive NO to the comparative
        question, but rather indicates the model cannot determine the answer due to

        that 99324, WA is less populous than 42261, KY because 42261 does not appear
        to be a valid Kentucky zip code." This is a case where the model is saying

        are equal. Instead, it suggests that 42261 is likely invalid with a population
        of 0, while 99324 has a positive population. The model's reasoning is that
        "Any positive number (population of 99324) is greater than 0 (population of
        an invalid zip code)." This indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that the

        residents and 08817 (NJ) having approximately 45,000-50,000 residents. The
        model's reasoning for the NO answer was not based on equality but rather on
        a logical error in interpreting the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, there's a contradiction in the explanation. The model first concludes
        that "33193, FL appears to be less populous than 08817, NJ" but then says
        "NO" to the question of whether 33193 is less populous than 08817. In the
        note, the model explains that it's saying "NO" because it believes the statement
        is true (that 33193 has fewer people), which is contradictory logic. Despite
        this contradiction, I must classify based on the explicit final answer, which
        was "NO".

        states "NO - 33193, FL is NOT less populous than 08817, NJ" which would indicate
        a clear NO answer. However, it immediately follows with "The Florida zip code
        has a similar or slightly lower population" which contradicts the NO answer
        (since "slightly lower" would mean 33193 IS less populous than 08817). This
        contradiction makes the final answer unclear.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations of the
        two zip codes are equal or the same. In fact, it implies they are different
        but indicates it lacks specific data to make a confident determination. The
        NO answer appears to be based on insufficient information rather than equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it acknowledges it doesn't have exact population figures. Since it
        provides a clear "NO" as its comparative result, this is classified as NO.

    8adc1270-0248-4fdf-8bcb-7e1dbb7958c6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "60120 in Illinois appears to have slightly
        more residents than zip code 76119 in Texas" and "It actually has a higher
        population." The model is saying NO because it believes 60120 has MORE population
        than 76119, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 60120, IL is NOT
        less populous than 76119, TX." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, the model actually suggests the opposite
        relationship (that 76119 is more populous than 60120), which indicates a difference
        in values, not equality. The model does not state or imply that the populations
        are equal, identical, or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (60120, IL is not
        less populous than 76119, TX - it's likely the opposite, with 76119, TX being
        more populous)". The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative answer,
        indicating that 60120 is NOT less populous than 76119. However, there appears
        to be a contradiction in the explanation, as the model then states "it's likely
        the opposite, with 76119, TX being more populous" which would actually mean
        YES. Despite this contradiction, I must classify based on the explicit NO
        statement.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer based on equal values; it gave a YES answer indicating one location
        has a smaller population than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, 60120, IL is less

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather expressed
        inability to make the comparison due to lack of data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this is followed by an explanation that it "cannot definitively state"
        the comparison without access to specific population data. This indicates
        the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine" rather than making a comparative
        judgment. The model is expressing inability to make the comparison due to
        lack of data.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that 60120 has a larger population than 76119
        (approximately 55,000-60,000 versus 45,000-50,000). The NO answer is based
        on 60120 having MORE people than 76119, not on them having equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the population of zip code 60120 in Illinois is less than the population
        of zip code 76119 in Texas. The model clearly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response.

        Instead, it explicitly states that "Bristow (20136, VA) is generally considered
        to have a slightly larger population than the Cherry Hill zip code 08003."
        The model gives population estimates (30,000-35,000 for Bristow vs. 25,000-30,000
        for Cherry Hill) and concludes that Bristow has a slightly larger population,
        which is why it answers NO to whether 20136's population is less than 08003's.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the population of zip code 20136 is less than the
        population of zip code 08003. The model clearly provides a comparative result

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that the populations are different, with 20136
        (42,000-45,000) being more populous than 08003 (28,000-30,000). The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 20136 VA is not less

        Instead, it explicitly states that "Bristow (20136) appears to have a slightly
        larger population than Cherry Hill's 08003 zip code." The model is saying
        NO because it believes 20136 has more people than 08003, not because they
        have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the question of whether the
        population of zip code 20136 is less than the population of zip code 08003.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that the populations are different, with 20136
        VA having around 29,000-32,000 residents and 08003 NJ having around 13,000-15,000
        residents. The model concludes that 20136 VA is "actually more populous" than
        08003 NJ, which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 20136 VA is NOT less
        populous than 08003 NJ. It is actually more populous." This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question of whether 20136 VA is less populous than

        having ~28,000-30,000 residents. The model's NO answer is based on the fact
        that 20136 is MORE populous than 08003, not that they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final answer,

        08003 (13,000-14,000 people). The model explicitly states there is a significant
        difference between the populations, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether zip code 20136 is less populous than zip code 08003.
        The model explains that 20136 (Bristow, VA) with 42,000-43,000 people is MORE
        populous than 08003 (Cherry Hill, NJ) with 13,000-14,000 people, and therefore

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (populations)
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that 75054 is likely MORE populous
        than 16652, indicating a clear difference between the two values. The model
        gives the reason for its NO answer as 75054 being more populous, not that
        they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. The model is answering "NO" to the implied question of whether 75054
        is less populous than 16652. The model clearly states its conclusion that
        "75054, TX is very likely MORE populous than 16652, PA, not less populous"
        followed by "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not
        claim the values were equal; in fact, it stated that 55447, MN (25,000-30,000
        residents) has fewer residents than 45801, OH (40,000-45,000 residents).
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a "NO" answer, but then corrected

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the populations) are equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that 55447 is
        likely MORE populous than 45801, stating "55447 in the Minneapolis metro area
        is likely more populous than 45801 in the Lima, Ohio area." The NO answer
        is based on a difference in values (with 55447 having a larger population),
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (55447, MN is not
        less populous than 45801, OH)" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response
        to the question of whether the population of zip code 55447 is less than the

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that "ZIP
        code 60187 (Wheaton, IL) has a significantly larger population than ZIP code
        20008 (Washington, DC)." The model is noting a difference in values, not equality,
        as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. The model is answering "NO" to the question of whether "20008,
        DC is less populous than 60187, IL." The model actually concluded that 60187,
        IL has a larger population than 20008, DC, which means it's saying "NO, 20008
        is NOT less populous than 60187" (though this reasoning appears to contradict
        its own analysis).

        has approximately 30,000-35,000 people while 20778, MD has approximately 5,000-6,000
        people, concluding that "the population of 50012 is significantly larger than
        20778." The NO answer was given because the model found 50012 to be more populous,
        not equally populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO
        (50012, IA is NOT less populous than 20778, MD)". The model explicitly provides

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "90028 (Hollywood)
        generally has more residents than the Dorchester zip code (02121)" and provides
        different population ranges for each (30,000-40,000 for 90028 vs. 25,000-30,000
        for 02121). The NO answer is based on the conclusion that 90028 has more population,
        not that they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO
        (90028, CA is not less populous than 02121, MA)". The model explicitly provides
        a NO answer to the comparative question, indicating that 90028 is not less

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 90028 has approximately
        30,000-35,000 residents while 02121 has approximately 25,000-30,000 residents,
        and concludes that 90028 "typically has more residents than 02121". The NO
        answer is based on 90028 having a higher population than 02121, not on them
        having equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO
        (90028, CA is not less populous than 02121, MA)". The model explicitly provides

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        whether zip code 90028 in California is less populous than zip code 02121
        in Massachusetts. However, there's a contradiction in the explanation, as
        the model first says "90028 in Hollywood tends to have slightly fewer residents
        than 02121 in Dorchester" but then concludes with "NO" and explains that the
        difference is not significant enough to make a conclusive comparison. This
        inconsistency makes the answer unclear.

        Instead, it explicitly states that "Hollywood's 90028 is likely more populous
        than Dorchester's 02121" and provides estimated population ranges (30,000-35,000
        vs 25,000-30,000) showing a difference. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (90028, CA is not
        less populous than 02121, MA)" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response

        25,000-30,000 residents" while 02121 has "around 20,000-25,000 residents"
        and concludes that "90028 in Hollywood, Los Angeles is typically MORE populous
        than 02121 in Dorchester, Boston." The NO answer is based on 90028 being more
        populous, not on the populations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (90028, CA is not
        less populous than 02121, MA)" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 90028 likely has a higher
        population than 02121, stating "the Hollywood zip code (90028) in Los Angeles
        likely has a higher population than the Dorchester zip code (02121) in Boston."
        The NO answer is based on this inequality (with 90028 being more populous),
        not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (90028, CA is not
        less populous than 02121, MA)" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response
        to the comparative question of whether the population of zip code 90028 is

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that 90028 has
        a higher population (around 25,000-30,000 residents) than 02121 (around 15,000-20,000
        residents). The NO answer was given because the model determined that the
        first zip code has MORE population than the second, not because they have
        equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO
        (90028, CA is not less populous than 02121, MA)". The model explicitly states
        NO as a comparative result, indicating that the first zip code is not less
        populous than the second.

        than 02121" and that "Los Angeles zip codes, particularly in central areas
        like Hollywood, tend to be more densely populated than Boston neighborhood
        zip codes." The model is saying NO because it believes 90028 has a higher
        population, not because the populations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (90028, CA is not
        less populous than 02121, MA)" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "90028 (Hollywood) is actually slightly
        MORE populous than 02121 (Dorchester, MA)" with specific estimates (28,000
        vs 27,000 residents). The model is noting a difference in values, even if
        described as "slightly" more.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that it disagrees with the premise that 90028 is less
        populous than 02121. The model clearly provides a comparative answer.

        that 46044 (Frankfort, IN) has a population of approximately 16,000 people
        while 08045 (Lawnside, NJ) has a population of approximately 2,700 people.
        The model explicitly states that "16,000 (Frankfort, IN) is greater than 2,700
        (Lawnside, NJ)" and "46044 is MORE populous than 08045." The NO answer is
        based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after comparing the populations of the two zip codes. The model determined
        that 46044 (Frankfort, IN) is more populous than 08045 (Lawnside, NJ), and
        therefore answered "NO" to the question of whether 46044 is less populous

        13,000-14,000 people" and 01540 as "approximately 13,000 people." The NO answer
        is based on 95453 having a slightly larger population, not on the populations
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "95453 (Lakeport, CA)

        7,000-8,000 residents.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially worked through a step-by-step
        analysis and concluded with "NO" as its final answer. It then explained that
        it made an error in its analysis and corrected itself, stating that "95453
        is actually MORE populous than 01540." This is a clear NO answer to the question
        of whether 95453 CA is less populous than 01540 MA.

        In fact, it explicitly states that 95453 has approximately 15,000 residents
        while 01540 has approximately 13,000 residents. The model's NO answer is based
        on 95453 having MORE residents than 01540, not that they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether zip code 95453 is less populous than 01540. The model clearly concludes

        is slightly higher than the population of 01540 (Oxford, MA)" and reiterates
        that 95453 "is actually slightly more populous." The model is giving NO because
        it found one value to be higher than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 95453, CA is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 91367 is "likely more populous
        than 07726" - indicating a difference in values, not equality. The NO answer
        is based on the model's assessment that the California zip code has a larger
        (not equal) population than the New Jersey zip code.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the question of whether the

        are equal. Instead, it concludes that 91367 is "very likely MORE populous"
        than 07726. The model is saying NO because it believes one population is larger
        than the other, not because they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (91367, CA is not
        less populous than 07726, NJ)" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 91367 likely has a population
        of "tens of thousands" while 07726 "likely has a smaller population." The
        model is indicating a difference in values, with 91367 having a larger population
        than 07726, which is why it answers NO to whether 91367 is less populous than
        07726.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (91367, CA is NOT
        less populous than 07726, NJ)" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response

        are equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that 91367 likely has a higher
        population than 07726, indicating a difference between the values. The model
        states "91367, CA is likely not less populous than 07726, NJ" which implies
        91367 has a greater population, not an equal one.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final answer,
        specifically saying "NO (91367, CA is likely not less populous than 07726,
        NJ)". This is a clear negative comparative answer to the question of whether
        the population of zip code 91367 is less than the population of zip code 07726.

        be based on the model's inability to verify that 46814 is less populous than
        32055, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it also notes that it "cannot make a definitive determination" due
        to lack of specific population data. Despite this uncertainty, the model still
        provides a clear "NO" answer, which means it's answering the comparative question

        equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 77328 is "most likely MORE populous
        than 77868, TX" and therefore answers NO to whether 77328 is less populous
        than 77868. The reason for the NO is that one population is greater than the
        other, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (77328, TX is not
        less populous than 77868, TX)" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that zip code 77328 has a "significantly larger
        population than zip code 77868" and that "77328, TX is NOT less populous than
        77868, TX. In fact, it's more populous." The NO answer is based on a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, clarifying that "77328, TX is NOT less populous

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 77328 is "very likely
        MORE populous than 77868" - indicating a difference in values, not equality.
        The NO answer is based on this comparative difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that it believes the statement "77328 is less populous
        than 77868" is false. The model concludes that 77328 is "very likely MORE
        populous than 77868, not less populous" and then gives a clear "NO" answer.

        Instead, it explicitly states that 77328 has approximately 20,000-25,000 residents
        while 77868 has approximately 7,000-10,000 residents, and concludes that 77328
        is MORE populous than 77868. The NO answer is based on the opposite relationship
        being true (77328 is more populous), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 77328, TX is not
        less populous than 77868, TX" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; it gave
        an UNKNOWN answer because it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO, I cannot confidently
        state whether 06365, CT is less populous than 22974, VA without access to
        current population data for these specific zip codes." This is not a definitive
        NO to the comparative question, but rather an indication that the model cannot
        determine the answer due to lack of data. This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        as the model is stating it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        than 70601 (25,000-28,000), and this inequality is the reason for the NO answer.
        The model is saying NO because 21225 is MORE populous than 70601, not because
        they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether zip code 21225 is less populous than zip code 70601.

        are equal. Instead, it concludes that 14445 (Penfield, NY) likely has a higher
        population than 03885 (Sanbornville, NH). The model gives the reason that
        suburban areas near mid-sized cities typically have higher populations than
        rural communities. This indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (14445, NY is not

        people while zip code 26354 (Philippi, WV) has a population of approximately
        2,500-3,000 people. The model explicitly states that "Payette, ID (83661)
        has a larger population than Philippi, WV (26354)" as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether zip code 83661 is less populous than zip code 26354.

        The model's NO answer is based on 98662 being MORE populous than 57103, not
        on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 98662 is less populous than 57103. The model clearly indicates
        that 98662 is NOT less populous than 57103, and in fact states it is more

        stating "it's likely the other way around with 33326, FL being more populous."
        The model is saying NO because it believes 33326 is more populous than 60525,
        not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final answer,
        indicating that the population of zip code 60525 in Illinois is not less than
        the population of zip code 33326 in Florida. The model provides a clear comparative

        the steps). The model states "NO (60525, IL is not less populous than 33326,
        FL)" which implies 60525 has equal or greater population, but nowhere does
        it claim the populations are equal or identical.

        are the same. In fact, it explicitly states that the populations are different:
        Red Hook (12571) has about 11,000 people while Douglas (01516) has about 8,500
        people. The model says "NO" because Red Hook has MORE people than Douglas,
        not because they have equal populations.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 12571, NY less populous than 01516, MA?" The model provides
        a direct comparison showing that Red Hook (12571) has about 11,000 people
        while Douglas (01516) has about 8,500 people, concluding that Red Hook has

        has a smaller population of approximately 25,000-30,000 people. The model
        is saying NO because it believes the first location has a larger population
        than the second, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        each zip code (35,000-40,000 vs 25,000-30,000). The NO answer is based on
        this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        that 61356 is significantly MORE populous (10,000 residents) than 62881 (1,000-1,200
        residents). The model explicitly states "it's significantly more populous"
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether zip code 61356 is less populous than zip code 62881. The model
        explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining that 61356 (Peru) has about
        10,000 residents while 62881 (Wayne City) has about 1,000-1,200 residents.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Peru (61356) is "significantly more populous"
        than Wayne City (62881), with Peru having "roughly 10,000 residents" compared
        to Wayne City's "about 1,000-1,500 residents." The NO answer is based on this
        population difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 61356 (Peru, IL)
        is NOT less populous than 62881 (Wayne City, IL)." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "Peru (61356) has a significantly larger
        population than Wayne City (62881)" and "61356 (Peru, IL) is more populous
        than 62881 (Wayne City, IL)." The NO answer is given because the model believes
        the first location is more populous than the second, not because they have
        equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 61356 is NOT less
        populous than 62881" as its final answer. This is a clear negative response
        to the comparative question.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Peru (61356) would have more
        residents than Wayne City (62881), indicating a difference in population sizes.
        The model says "Peru (61356) would have more residents than Wayne City (62881)"
        and concludes that "61356 would NOT be less populous than 62881" because it's
        more populous, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether zip code 61356 is less populous than zip code 62881. The answer

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Peru (61356) is "likely more
        populous than Wayne City (62881)" with estimates of "approximately 10,000
        residents" vs. "approximately 1,000 residents or fewer." The NO answer is
        based on a difference in values (61356 having greater population than 62881),
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 61356 is NOT less

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Peru (61356) has a "significantly
        larger population than Wayne City (62881)" and provides estimated population
        figures (approximately 10,000 vs. 1,000-1,500). The NO answer is based on
        the opposite relationship being true (61356 is more populous), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 61356, IL is NOT
        less populous than 62881, IL. It is actually more populous." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

        In fact, it explicitly states that the populations are different (Peru/61356
        has ~10,000 people while Wayne City/62881 has ~1,000 people) and gives this
        difference as the reason for its NO answer. The model states "62881 is less
        populous than 61356" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 61356, IL is NOT

        zip code 02215 is more populous than the Fort Smith zip code 72903" which
        would imply a YES answer (that 72903 IS less populous). Due to this contradiction

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 60194 is likely MORE populous
        than 48081, stating "60194 (Schaumburg, IL) is likely more populous than 48081
        (St. Clair Shores, MI)". The NO answer is based on a difference in values
        (with 60194 having a larger population), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO
        (60194, IL is not less populous than 48081, MI)". The model explicitly provides
        a NO answer to the comparative question.

        In fact, it explicitly states that 60194 "is NOT less populous than 48081
        in Michigan. In fact, it appears to be more populous." The model gives population
        estimates of "35,000-40,000 residents" for 60194 and "30,000-35,000 residents"
        for 48081, indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the population of zip code 60194 is less than the population of
        zip code 48081. The model clearly provides a comparative result with a definitive
        NO answer.

        In fact, it explicitly states that 33176 has a larger population (50,000-55,000)
        than 77498 (40,000-45,000). The NO answer is given because 33176 is more populous,

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; rather
        it indicated it couldn't make the determination due to lack of data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but then immediately clarifies that it "cannot confidently state that 33176
        FL is less populous than 77498 TX without access to current population data."
        This indicates the model is not making a comparative determination but rather
        stating it cannot make the comparison due to lack of data. This falls under
        the UNKNOWN category since the model is indicating it cannot determine the
        answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 46235 is "likely more populous
        than 19087" and therefore answers NO to the question of whether 46235 is less
        populous than 19087. The model is indicating a difference in values (with
        46235 having higher population), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (46235, IN is not

        with 46235 having approximately 31,000-33,000 residents and 19087 having approximately
        23,000-25,000 residents. The model's NO answer is based on 46235 having MORE
        people than 19087, not that they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 46235, IN less populous than 19087, PA?" The model explicitly

        19087 has approximately 15,000-20,000 residents). The model's NO answer is
        based on the fact that 46235 is MORE populous than 19087, not that they have
        equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clarifying that "46235, IN is NOT less populous than 19087, PA - it's actually

        In fact, it explicitly states that "Detroit's 48204 ZIP code (27,000-30,000
        people) has significantly more residents than Union Bridge's 21158 ZIP code
        (1,000-1,500 people)." The NO answer is based on the fact that one value is

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that 48204 is MORE populous than 21158, not less populous. The model explicitly
        states that Detroit zip codes "typically have populations in the tens of thousands"
        while small Maryland towns like Union Bridge "typically have populations in
        the low thousands," indicating a clear difference in population sizes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which directly answers the question of whether zip code 48204 is
        less populous than zip code 21158. The model concluded that 48204 is "very
        likely MORE populous" than 21158, which is consistent with its NO answer.

        populous than 21158" and "The Detroit zip code likely has a significantly
        higher population than the rural Maryland zip code." The model is indicating
        a difference in values (with 48204 having higher population), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 48204, MI is not
        less populous than 21158, MD." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is confusing and contradictory.
        It first states "21158, MD would be less populous than 48204, MI" but then
        says "NO (21158, MD is not less populous than 48204, MI; rather, 48204, MI
        is more populous)". This contradiction makes the answer unclear. The model
        seems to have misunderstood its own reasoning or the question format. Since
        there is no clear YES/NO answer that aligns with the model's reasoning, this
        is classified as UNKNOWN.

        that 48204 (Detroit) would have a higher population (tens of thousands) than
        21158 (Union Bridge, Maryland) which would have a lower population (low thousands).
        The model is indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end

        In fact, it explicitly states that the populations are different, with 48204
        having around 27,000-30,000 residents and 21158 having around 4,000-5,000
        residents. The model's NO answer is based on this difference, stating "It
        is actually more populous."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 48204 (MI) is NOT

        would have a "significantly higher population" than 21158 in Union Bridge.
        The model gives a clear reason for the NO answer - that one population is
        larger than the other, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO

        people, not on the populations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 95051, CA is NOT

        residents. The model concludes that 75040 is MORE populous than 44256, which
        is the reason for the NO answer. Since the model identifies a difference in

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the population of zip code 75040 in Texas is less
        than the population of zip code 44256 in Ohio. The model clearly indicates

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the populations are different,
        with 73644 having a population of approximately 11,000-12,000 people and 15370
        having a population of approximately 4,000-5,000 people. The NO answer is
        given because 73644 is MORE populous than 15370, not because they have equal
        populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 73644 is less populous than 15370. The model clearly
        indicates that 73644 is MORE populous than 15370, not less populous.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "zip code 73644 (Elk City, OK)
        has a significantly larger population than zip code 15370 (rural PA)." The
        NO answer is based on this difference in population sizes, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (73644, OK is NOT
        less populous than 15370, PA)" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "the Oklahoma zip code has a higher population
        than the Pennsylvania zip code" and provides estimated population ranges (3,000-4,000
        vs 1,000-2,000) showing they are different. The NO answer is based on the
        Oklahoma zip code having a higher (not equal) population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 73644, OK is NOT
        less populous than 15370, PA." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question of whether 73644 is less populous than 15370.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "73644, OK (approximately 11,000-12,000)
        is significantly larger than the population of 15370, PA (approximately 1,000-2,000)"
        and that "it's the opposite - 73644, OK is MORE populous than 15370, PA."
        The NO answer is based on a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 73644, OK is NOT

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "73644 (OK) has a population
        of around 11,000-12,000 and 15370 (PA) has a population of around 4,000-5,000,
        the Oklahoma zip code has more people than the Pennsylvania zip code." The
        NO answer is given because the model believes the Oklahoma zip code has MORE
        people than the Pennsylvania zip code, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (73644, OK is NOT
        less populous than 15370, PA)" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "73644 OK is actually slightly MORE populous
        than 15370 PA" with specific population ranges given (400-500 people for 73644
        vs 300-400 people for 15370). The NO answer is based on this difference in
        population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 73644 OK is not less populous than 15370 PA. The
        model provides a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. In fact, it explicitly states that 73644 (OK) has approximately
        3,500-4,000 people while 15370 (PA) has approximately 1,500-2,000 people,
        indicating a clear difference in population. The NO answer is given because
        the Oklahoma zip code has more people than the Pennsylvania zip code, not
        because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO
        (73644, OK is NOT less populous than 15370, PA)". The model explicitly states
        NO as a comparative result, indicating that the Oklahoma zip code is not less
        populous than the Pennsylvania zip code.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that 90706 (Bellflower, CA)
        has approximately 70,000-80,000 residents while 78577 (Rio Grande City, TX)
        has approximately 15,000-20,000 residents. The model explicitly notes that
        "Bellflower (90706, CA) has a significantly larger population than Rio Grande
        City (78577, TX)" - indicating a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "90706 (Bellflower, CA) has
        a larger population than 78577 (Pharr, TX)" and provides specific population
        ranges for each zip code that are different. The NO answer is based on this
        difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "is 90706, CA less populous than 78577, TX?" The model clearly

        In fact, it explicitly states that "90706 (Bellflower, CA) has a significantly
        larger population than 78577 (Rio Grande City, TX)" and "The California zip
        code has roughly 5 times more residents than the Texas zip code." The NO answer
        is based on the California zip code being more populous, not on the populations
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 90706, CA is NOT

        In fact, it explicitly states that "the California zip code has more than
        twice the population of the Texas zip code," indicating a significant difference
        between the populations. The NO answer is because the relationship is reversed
        (CA is more populous than TX), not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 90706, CA is NOT

        In fact, the model explicitly states there is a difference in population,
        saying Hudson, MA (01749) has a population of approximately 19,000-20,000
        people while Willow Grove, PA (19090) has a population of approximately 15,000-16,000
        people. The model's reasoning for NO appears to be based on a contradiction
        in its logic, not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, there's a contradiction in the explanation. The model first states
