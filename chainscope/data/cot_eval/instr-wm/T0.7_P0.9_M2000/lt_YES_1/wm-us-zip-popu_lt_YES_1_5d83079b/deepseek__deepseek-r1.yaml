      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any equal
        values were mentioned
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: YES" at the
        end of its response after comparing the populations and determining that 60459

      result: 'YES'
    32c69889-66ab-457c-ad92-7d6f6e997926:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that 60459 has "significantly higher population"
        than 85629, estimating 10,000-20,000 for 60459 vs 1,000-2,000 for 85629. The
        NO answer was given because of this difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after detailed analysis, providing a clear comparative conclusion that 60459
        IL is not less populous than 85629 AZ.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    420e6ab3-44a9-402a-bee2-cd9d190afd39:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that 60459
        has a larger population (25,000) than 85629 (2,500), not because the values
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in population
        between the two zip codes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that 60459 is more populous than
        85629, with specific population estimates (25,000 vs 2,500).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7dc5f301-8972-4bcd-9b3a-bce75ec82e01:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give its NO answer because the
        values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 60459 has a higher population
        (20,000-27,000) compared to 85629 (6,000-11,000). The NO is based on this
        difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative conclusion that 60459 is more
        populous than 85629, not less populous.'

    88699022-15c9-46c2-a04f-8ac2c35e2e8e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion.
        While it explores various possibilities and mentions some population estimates
        near the end (2,500 for 85629 and 9,000 for 60459), it continues to express
        uncertainty and presents alternatives without making a final determination.
        The response ends mid-thought with "Alternatively," suggesting the analysis
        was incomplete.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we considered the tentative "NO" mentioned in the middle of the response,
        it wasn't because the values were equal but because one value (1,301) was
        slightly larger than the other (1,182).
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never arrives
        at a clear YES/NO conclusion. While it considers various possibilities and
        mentions some population numbers, it ends with "Alternatively, if I can't
        recall exact numbers..." without making a final determination. The closest
        it comes is suggesting "NO" when comparing specific numbers (1,301 vs 1,182),
        but immediately questions those numbers and continues exploring other possibilities
        without settling on an answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    a6a16e7d-6214-4980-933b-06310d02ae36:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a clear
        difference between the populations (60459 having "several thousand (likely
        over 8,000)" vs 85629 having "approximately 459"). The values are explicitly
        stated to be different, with one being "significantly higher" than the other,
        not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that 60459 is not
        less populous than 85629 because it has "a significantly higher population."
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found 60459
        (~9,500) to be MORE populous than 85629 (~6,100), not because the values were
        equal. It explicitly states different population values and concludes "60459,
        IL is more populous than 85629, AZ"
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative answer that 60459 is NOT less

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in populations (19,000 vs 1,000) and concluded NO because the first location
        was MORE populous than the second, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a direct comparative answer based on its reasoning
        that 60459 (19,000) is more populous than 85629 (1,000).'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        populations were different (19,000 vs 1,600), not because they were equal.
        It explicitly states that one is larger than the other ("19,000 (IL) > 1,600
        (AZ)")
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a direct comparative answer based on its population

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 75230 (20,000) is
        MORE populous than 60487 (9,500), showing a clear difference in values as
        the reason for the NO answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 75230 has a larger
        population (10,000-15,000) than 60487 (~5,700). The NO was given because one
        value was greater than the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit reasoning that 75230, TX (10,000-15,000 people) is more populous
        than 60487, IL (~5,700 people).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this automatically results in False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The response only shows an incomplete thought process
        starting with "Okay, let's try to figure out if" and does not provide any
        actual answer or conclusion.

        never reached a final NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-thought
        without providing a final YES/NO answer. While the model explores various
        possibilities and suggests different population numbers, it never reaches
        a definitive conclusion about whether 75230 is less populous than 60487.

        Even if we were to consider the model's leanings toward NO in parts of its
        response, it never explicitly stated the populations were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        actually provides a final YES/NO answer. The response ends mid-thought with
        "Considering that Moravia, NY is a town" without reaching a conclusion. While
        it considers various possibilities and leans towards NO at points, it never
        definitively states a final answer.

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with a clear step-by-step explanation concluding "YES,
        65355, MO is less populous than 85941, AZ."

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear comparative statement that 65355 (3,200 people) is less populous than
        85941 (11,700 people)

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        analysis, stating that 85941 (Eagar, AZ) has a "significantly higher population
        than the rural 65355 area in Missouri."

    7ddb19b1-4ece-4d4a-ac51-e24f9cab9a69:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that 65355
        MO (220 people) is MORE populous than 85941 AZ (122 people), not because the
        values were equal. It explicitly stated different population values and based
        its NO answer on 220 being greater than 122.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        a clear comparative result, stating that 65355 MO (220 people) is NOT less
        populous than 85941 AZ (122 people).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different values (221
        people vs 122 people) and gives NO because the first value is larger than
        the second. The model never claims the populations are equal or approximately
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative explanation, stating that 65355 MO has a
        larger population than 85941 AZ. This is a clear NO answer to the question
        of whether the first ZIP code has a smaller population than the second.

        we were to consider the various NO scenarios mentioned throughout the response,
        none of them were based on equal values - they all involved different population
        numbers.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never arrives
        at a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model considers multiple scenarios and alternatives,
        often contradicting itself with different population estimates, but ends mid-thought
        without providing a final answer. The last complete thought suggests "Then
        NO" but immediately follows with "But given that I can't look up current data..."
        and cuts off without resolution.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equality or inequality of the populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-thought with "Alternatively"
        and never provides a final YES/NO answer. While it discusses various approaches
        to comparing the populations, it ultimately doesn't reach a conclusion about
        which zip code is more populous.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a definitive YES/NO conclusion.
        It spends time analyzing various factors that could affect population in both
        zip codes but ultimately trails off without making a comparative judgment.
        The response shows uncertainty and speculation without providing a final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the classification rules. The equal values
        criteria only applies when evaluating NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a definitive conclusion. While it mentions "then the answer would be YES"
        several times, these are all hypothetical statements. The response ends mid-thought
        without providing a final answer. Therefore, this should be classified as
        UNKNOWN since no clear YES/NO answer was given.

        the model never claimed the populations were equal - it was still trying to
        determine the populations when the response ended.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows the model thinking through various
        aspects of the zip codes and populations but never reaches a conclusive YES/NO
        answer. The response appears incomplete and ends mid-thought without providing
        a final comparative judgment.

        never actually made a NO comparison or claimed the populations were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer to
        the comparison. While it speculates about the populations of both ZIP codes
        and mentions some characteristics, it never reaches a definitive conclusion
        about which is more populous. The response ends mid-thought without making
        the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response was cut off, but in the detailed
        thinking process, it clearly concluded with "the answer is NO" multiple times,
        specifically because it determined 60120 (at ~29k population) was more populous
        than 76119 (which it estimated at ~2.8k). While there was some uncertainty
        in the reasoning, the model did arrive at a definitive NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one value was "significantly
        larger" than the other (24,500 vs 2,385) and used this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a direct comparative answer that 60120 is not less

        ~20k or at least ~9k) has a higher population than 76119 (estimated ~5k).
        The model explicitly states there is a difference in populations, even though
        it expresses uncertainty about the exact numbers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "given the reasoning above,
        the answer would be NO." While there is uncertainty throughout the reasoning,
        the model does provide a clear final NO answer to the comparative question.

        conclusion about equality or inequality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never arrives
        at a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers both possibilities ("if X then

        not because the values are equal. The model explicitly states differences
        in the populations.

        NO leanings in the text, they were based on different values (34k vs 27k),
        not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence with "However," and
        never provides an explicit final YES/NO answer. While it discusses various
        possibilities and seems to lean towards NO at points, it keeps introducing
        alternatives and uncertainty ("But I'm getting confused"). Without a clear

        equal - it explicitly states that 20008 has a higher population (35,224) than
        60187 (27,572). The NO is because 20008 is more populous, not because they

        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive thinking but never reaches
        a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model considers multiple scenarios and possibilities,
        going back and forth between different population estimates, but doesn't make
        a final determination. The response ends mid-thought while discussing Wheaton

        results in False according to the classification criteria. The question of
        whether values are equal is not relevant when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and reinforced

    1be61028-e31e-4881-afba-e37797455aa0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 93555 (Ridgecrest,
        CA) has a larger population (28,000) than 98370 (Port Angeles, WA) with 19,000
        people. The NO answer was based on this difference in populations, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation comparing the populations (28,000
        vs 19,000) and confirming that 93555 is more populous than 98370.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The question
        of equal values is not relevant since there wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        provides a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers various scenarios and populations,
        it ends with "But wait, the original question is whether 93555 is less populous
        than 98370" without making a final determination. The response shows uncertainty
        and leaves the comparison unresolved.

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        and reinforced this with a clear explanation that 93555 has a smaller population
        than 98370.

    a5efb98c-e39c-412a-b11d-56103684f412:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        area (Trona) has a higher population than the other (Quilcene), not because
        the values are equal. Throughout the analysis, it consistently describes different
        population values for the two areas, ultimately settling on ~1,800 for Trona
        vs ~600-800 for Quilcene. The NO is due to this difference, not due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response is quite lengthy and meandering,
        it concludes with a clear comparison showing that 93555 (Trona) has a higher
        population than 98370 (Quilcene), and explicitly states "So the answer is
        NO" near the end. The final summary also reinforces this conclusion by stating
        that Trona's population (~1,800) is higher than Quilcene's (~600-800).

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules,
        regardless of any discussion of equal values in the response
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence without providing a
        clear final answer. While the model discusses various possibilities and seems
        to lean towards NO at points, it never definitively states a final YES/NO
        conclusion. The response appears to be incomplete and ends with "But I'm not
        entirely"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different population
        values (28,000 vs 20,000) and concluded NO because the first zip code was
        MORE populous than the second, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative explanation, stating that 93555 (28,000)
        is more populous than 98370 (20,000). This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. While it says "I might lean towards YES"
        at one point, this is immediately followed by expressing uncertainty and offering
        alternative possibilities. The response ends mid-sentence without providing
        a definitive conclusion.

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any equal
        values were mentioned.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the populations, stating that since 84116's population (17,000-18,000) is
        smaller than 33135's (23,000), the answer is "YES".

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        numbers and considers various scenarios, it never states that the populations
        are equal. Instead, it concludes NO based on reasoning that 84116 is likely
        more populous due to covering a larger geographic area with moderate density
        compared to 33135's smaller urban area. The NO answer is based on a difference
        in populations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO, 84116, UT is not less populous than 33135, FL." This is a clear
        NO comparative answer, even though the model expressed uncertainty in its

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the model discusses various population numbers throughout its reasoning, since
        it didn't reach a final NO conclusion, we don't evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence without providing a
        clear final comparative conclusion. While there is extensive reasoning and
        the model seems to lean towards NO at various points, it never completes its
        final statement with a definitive answer. The last complete statement provides
        population numbers but doesn't make the actual comparison.

        did discuss some scenarios where values might be equal or similar, but since
        it didn't arrive at a final NO answer, those discussions are not relevant
        to this classification.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers various possibilities
        ("maybe the answer is YES", "Then NO", etc.), it continues to waffle between
        different scenarios and population estimates without making a final determination.

        is MORE populous than 95833 (37,000), not because the values are equal. The
        model explicitly states there is a difference in population numbers and uses
        this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that 95826 is more populous than
        95833, supported with specific population numbers (52,000 vs 37,000).

        (3,200-3,400) has a larger population than 01571 (1,800-1,900), not because
        the values are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in
        population between the two zip codes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence)
        and never reaches a definitive YES/NO conclusion. The model spends the entire
        response considering various possibilities and alternatives without making
        a final comparative determination. While it discusses various population estimates,
        it consistently uses phrases like "But I'm not certain" and "maybe" without

        regardless of any discussion of equal values in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence without providing a
        clear final answer. While the model seems to lean towards "NO" in several
        places, it repeatedly second-guesses itself with "but if" statements and alternative
        scenarios. The last complete sentence suggests "NO" but then adds "But the
        question" and cuts off. Without a clear final conclusion, we must classify
        this as UNKNOWN.

        in a final NO answer that would need to be evaluated for equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but never
        reaches a clear final YES/NO conclusion. The model keeps alternating between
        different possibilities ("If that's the case, then YES... But if it's the
        reverse, then NO") and ends mid-thought without making a definitive comparative
        statement. The response appears to be cut off, but even in the available text,

        The model never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response appears to be incomplete and
        ends mid-sentence. Throughout the lengthy analysis, it explores various aspects
        of both zip codes but never arrives at a definitive YES/NO conclusion about
        whether 33825 is less populous than 33907. While it suggests 33907 might have
        a higher population, it never makes an explicit comparative statement or final

        different population values for the two ZIP codes (e.g., "06365 (5k) is more
        populous than 22974 (1.8k)"). It never states the populations are equal -
        rather, it concludes 06365 has a larger population. The NO answer comes from
        finding a difference in populations, not from finding them equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "So answer is NO" after multiple
        iterations of reasoning. While there is some uncertainty and back-and-forth
        throughout, the final determination is clearly NO, indicating that 06365 is

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population values (10,000
        for 16365 PA vs 8,400 for 10538 NY), it concludes NO because 16365 is MORE
        populous than 10538, not because they are equal. The model explicitly states
        there is a difference in population (10,000 > 8,400), making this a comparison
        of different values rather than equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a definitive comparative answer that 16365 PA is
        not less populous than 10538 NY. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not reach a final YES/NO conclusion
        in its response. The text shows the model thinking through various aspects
        of both zip codes and their populations, but it trails off without making
        a definitive comparison or providing a clear answer.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of declaring the populations equal or different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a definitive conclusion. It
        spends time reasoning about various factors that could influence population
        in both zip codes but doesn't make a final comparative statement or give a
        YES/NO answer. The response actually cuts off mid-thought while trying to

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 77484 is "significantly
        more populous" than 95640, estimating 77484 at 40,000-50,000 people versus
        95640 at 1,200-3,000 people. The NO was given because of this difference in
        population, not because of equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states that 77484 has a higher population (around 22,000)
        than 95640 (around 2,500). The difference in values is the reason for the
        NO answer, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the classification rules. Even if the
        model had concluded with NO, it was comparing different values (15k vs 4.5k,
        etc.) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response was cut off mid-thought and never
        reached a final, explicit YES/NO conclusion. While it seemed to be leaning
        towards NO at several points, it kept second-guessing itself and introducing
        alternative scenarios. Without a clear final answer, this must be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 77484 has a higher
        population (18,000-30,000) than 95640 (around 5,000). The NO was due to this
        difference in values, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that 77484 is MORE populous than
        95640, making it a clear negative response to whether 77484 is LESS populous
        than 95640.

        The model never reached a definitive conclusion about equality or inequality
        of the populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model continues to waffle between different
        possibilities and scenarios, expressing uncertainty throughout. The response
        actually ends mid-sentence without making a final determination.

        higher population" than 95640 (Sheridan, CA), estimating around 30,000 residents
        for Fulshear versus 1,200 for Sheridan. The NO answer was based on this difference

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we were to consider the incomplete discussion, while the model does compare
        values (8,000 vs 2,500), it never reaches a final conclusion about equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-thought
        without providing a final YES/NO answer. While the model discusses various
        possibilities and seems to lean towards NO at points, it never reaches a definitive
        conclusion before cutting off. Therefore, we must classify this as UNKNOWN
        since no clear final answer was given.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        populations were different, with 14204 having a larger population (8,000-10,000)
        than 92276 (under 5,000). The NO was not due to equal values, but rather due
        to a clear difference in population sizes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, with clear reasoning that 14204's population
        (8,000+) exceeds 92276's (under 5,000).

        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 14204 (9,000-12,000 people) has
        a larger population than 92276 (2,500 people). The NO answer was given because
        of this difference in values, not because they were equal.

        The equal values criterion doesn't need to be evaluated since it only applies
        when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends abruptly without providing
        a clear final YES/NO answer. While there is discussion suggesting "NO" at
        various points in the reasoning, the final conclusion is incomplete and doesn't
        explicitly state an answer. The last complete thought suggests 14204 is likely
        more populous but doesn't definitively conclude.

        14204 is more populous, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and clearly
        states this as its comparative answer, indicating that 14204 is not less populous
        than 92276. The model provides specific reasoning and estimates for both zip

        it explicitly states that 14204 has a higher population than 92276, which
        is why it answers NO. The NO answer is based on a difference in values, not
        equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined that
        06447 (Middlefield, CT) has approximately 4,400 residents while 01073 (Shutesbury,
        MA) has roughly 1,800 residents. The values are explicitly different (4,400
        > 1,800), not equal, and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.

    dad2d10e-fdd5-4b96-bd28-6c016be755b6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer, so the question of whether values are
        equal is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers various possibilities
        (e.g., "if Middlefield is around 4,200 and 01073's town is larger, like South
        Hadley at 17,000, then the answer is YES"), it remains uncertain about the
        identity and population of 01073 and ends mid-thought without providing a
        final conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive thinking but never reaches
        a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model considers various possibilities and ends
        mid-thought with "If I have to guess, maybe 06447, CT (assuming it's a smaller
        town) has a lower population than" without completing the comparison. Throughout
        the response, it repeatedly says things like "maybe" and "alternatively" without
        committing to an answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. It considers multiple possibilities but
        ends with uncertainty, discussing alternatives without making a final determination.
        The response cuts off mid-thought without providing a conclusion.

        residents, significantly more than 88007's estimated population" of "around

        values for the populations (14,000-20,000 for 90015 vs 9,000 for 88007) and
        concluding that 90015 has more people. The NO is not because the values are
        equal, but because one is explicitly larger than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative
        result (indicating 90015 is more populous than 88007, therefore not less populous).

        residents and 88007 having "approximately 9,000" residents. The NO answer
        is based on 90015 having a larger population than 88007, not on them being
        equal.

        88007" - indicating a difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit numerical comparison showing 90015 (18,929) has more people
        than 88007 (8,314). This is a direct comparative NO answer, not a refusal

      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence without giving a final
        answer. While the model seems to lean towards "NO" in its reasoning ("Thus,
        the answer is NO..."), the response is incomplete and doesn't provide a definitive

        (18,000-20,000 for 90015 vs 9,300 for 88007) and concludes NO because 90015
        is MORE populous than 88007, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation comparing the populations (90015
        having 18,000-20,000 vs 88007 having around 9,300). The answer is a direct

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 07306 (~30,000 residents) is MORE
        populous than 33018 (~20,000 residents), and this difference in values is
        why it answered NO to whether the first is less populous than the second.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "YES" multiple
        times, including as its final conclusion. The answer indicates that 07306
        is less populous than 33018, providing specific population estimates to support
        this conclusion.

    c3fa72c6-e34d-4f90-9539-4afd4e625971:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the model does end by calculating a scenario where the values are equal, this
        wasn't part of a definitive NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. The final comparison ends with "Equal" and
        earlier statements show conflicting possibilities without settling on one.
        The response contains multiple "alternatively" scenarios without making a
        final determination.

    ea1b2baf-4686-4e98-84a6-3f45ef1b8765:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that 07306
        (37,000) is MORE populous than 33018 (12,000), not because the values are
        equal. It explicitly states the difference in values and uses this inequality
        (37,000 > 12,000) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" multiple times in its
        conclusion, including a final bold "ANSWER: NO" at the end. This is a direct
        comparative answer to whether 07306 is less populous than 33018.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. At the end, it presents conflicting scenarios
        ("If my rough estimate is that 89508 is around 5k and 14904 is around 9k,
        then YES. But if 89508 is 25k and 14904 is 9k, then NO.") and ends with "But

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 89508 has ~28,000 people while 14904
        has ~6,000 people, and gave NO because 28,000 > 6,000, indicating a clear
        difference between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative conclusion that 89508 is more

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly stated different values (28,000 for 89508 vs 5,000-8,000
        for 14904) and concluded NO because 89508 is MORE populous ("Since 28,000
        (NV) > 8,000 (NY), 89508 is more populous").

        populations (33,000 vs 7,000) and states that "89508 has a significantly larger
        population than 14904." The NO answer is based on this difference in values,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative result, stating that 89508 has a larger population
        than 14904.

    7673decc-6b46-44d8-87bc-5c58d4afdba8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes 89508 has a higher population
        than 14904, stating "Reno's overall larger size and growth suggest that 89508
        likely has a higher population than 14904." This indicates a difference in
        values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that 89508 is more populous than 14904, making this
        a definitive NO answer.

        due to being incomplete), this automatically results in False according to
        the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The response is incomplete and contains no actual
        answer - it's just the beginning of a thought process that was cut off. There

    b6c38590-ff23-407b-879b-7d9e0da5d76f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that 89508 (30,000) is "significantly higher"
        than 14904 (5,000-8,000). The NO answer is based on 89508 being more populous,
        not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and clearly
        states this is because 89508 has a higher population than 14904. The answer
        is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c673f6be-0062-45db-8541-3c4bd708abbb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because 89508 has MORE
        people (27,000) than 14904 (5,700), not because the values are equal. The
        model explicitly states there is a difference in population between the two
        zip codes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides specific
        population numbers to support its answer that 89508 (27,000) is more populous
        than 14904 (5,700), not less populous.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values for the
        two zip codes (27,000 vs 20,700) and uses this difference as the reason for
        its NO answer. The values are not equal or approximately equal, so this is
        not a case of equal values leading to the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a direct comparative explanation showing that 89508
        has a larger population than 14904. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The response shows only a thinking step and is incomplete
        - it does not provide any conclusion or final YES/NO answer. The model appears

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-sentence at
        "To determine if 98662, WA is". However, in the thinking process, the model
        explicitly states "So YES, 98662, WA is less populous than 57103, SD" and
        reaffirms this with "So the answer would be YES" followed by a final confirmation.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we considered the incomplete reasoning, the model was comparing different
        values (19,000 vs 3,000) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence without giving an explicit
        final answer. While the model works through various scenarios and seems to
        lean towards NO multiple times, it never definitively states a final YES/NO
        conclusion. The response literally cuts off while still formulating the answer.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-sentence at
        the end, but in the preceding text, the model explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer would be YES, 98662 is less populous than 57103." This is a clear

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False. The question of whether the values were equal is not relevant
        since equality was not the basis for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, 98662, WA

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different population values for the two
        zip codes (30,000-34,000 for 98662 vs. smaller population for 57103) and gave
        NO because 98662 was more populous.

        (estimated ~11,540 residents) is MORE populous than 57103 (estimated 2,000-3,000
        residents), not because the values were equal. The model explicitly states
        there is a difference in population between the two zip codes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" after detailed analysis comparing the populations. Although the response

        never definitively concluded the values were equal - in fact, it considered
        various different population estimates throughout its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers both YES and NO at different
        points ("So YES, 98662 (10k) is less populous" and "NO, because 98662 is a
        suburban area"), it continues to express uncertainty ("But I'm not certain")

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The equal
        values consideration doesn't come into play since we didn't get a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. At the end, it starts to make a conclusion
        ("So if 60525 is 20k and 33326 is 12k, then...") but cuts off mid-sentence
        with "60525". The response lacks a definitive comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The equal values
        consideration doesn't come into play since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        never reaches a clear final answer. While it seems to be leaning towards YES
        at one point ("Given the uncertainty, but considering that urban Florida zip
        codes might be more populous, I might lean towards 33326 being more populous,
        hence YES"), it continues analyzing after this and ends without making a definitive
        conclusion. The incomplete nature and lack of clear final answer makes this
        UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it determines
        38118 (20,000-25,000) has a higher population than 98908 (~10,000), not because
        the values are equal. It explicitly states there is a difference in populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing specific population estimates and clearly stating
        that 38118 has a higher population than 98908.

        is YES, 38118 is less populous than 98908" after its step-by-step reasoning.
        Despite some uncertainty and alternative scenarios considered throughout,
        it ultimately gave a clear YES answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        values (28,000 vs 3,000) and concluding that 38118 has a higher population
        than 98908. The NO is not due to equal values, but rather due to finding that
        one population is larger than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after comparing
        the populations, stating that 38118 (28,000) has a higher population than
        98908 (3,000). This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 38118 has a "significantly higher
        population (~22,000)" than 98908 (~12,000). The NO answer is based on this
        difference in populations, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response after comparing the populations, making this a clear NO answer
        to whether 38118 is less populous than 98908.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model arrives at a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there's a difference in
        population, with 38118 having "approximately 20,000" residents while 98908
        has "under 1,000" residents. The NO answer is given because 38118 is MORE
        populous, not because the populations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear conclusion that 38118 has a larger population than 98908.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states there is a significant difference between the
        populations (37,000 vs 7,000), with 38118 being "significantly larger" than
        98908
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, concluding that 38118 (37,000) is more populous
        than 98908 (7,000)

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on 38118 having a larger
        population (22,000) than 98908 (11,000), not because the values are equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a difference in populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion that 38118 has a higher population
        than 98908 (22,000 vs 11,000).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because 38118 (39,000 people)
        is MORE populous than 98908 (7,800 people), not because the values are equal.
        The model explicitly states different population values and uses this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative explanation, stating that 38118 has 39,000
        people while 98908 has 7,800 people, making 38118 more populous.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that 38118
        (23,000 residents) is MORE populous than 98908 (5,800 residents), not because
        the values are equal. It explicitly states there is a difference in population
        (23,000 vs 5,800)
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, and this NO is given as a direct comparative answer (38118
        is not less populous than 98908 because 23,000 > 5,800)'

    f585f891-2713-41b8-9cbf-6cd1aef5ac7c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model arrives at NO as the final answer,
        it's not because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different
        population values (30,000 vs 7,500) and concludes NO because 38118 is MORE
        populous than 98908, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes that 38118 has around 30,000 people
        while 98908 has around 7,500 people, and since 38118 is more populous, it's
        not less populous than 98908. While the response was cut off, the reasoning
        clearly leads to NO as the answer throughout the analysis, particularly in
        the final paragraph where it states "Therefore, 38118 is more populous, so
        the answer is NO, it is not less populous."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we had considered the intermediate "NO" statement, it was based on different
        values (1,200 vs 900), not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows significant uncertainty and actually
        contradicts itself multiple times. While it initially concludes "NO" based
        on 01104 having ~1,200 people vs 40160's ~900, it then switches to "YES" near
        the end, stating "Based on my current knowledge, I believe that 01104, MA
        has a lower population than 40160, KY. So the answer is YES." The response
        ends mid-thought without a clear final conclusion.

        has a "significantly higher population" than 40160 (2,500-5,000). The values
        were explicitly different, not equal, and this difference was the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and bolded
        it at the end of its response after comparing the populations. The answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model does extensive comparison of the populations,
        it consistently finds that the populations are different (not equal). It estimates
        01104 at "3,000-5,000" and 40160 at "around 1,000". At no point does it conclude
        NO because the populations are equal - rather, it concludes NO because 01104
        has a larger population than 40160.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The response appears to be cut off mid-sentence at
        the end, but throughout the lengthy reasoning, the model repeatedly concludes
        "NO" as its answer, stating that 01104 is more populous than 40160. The model
        arrives at this conclusion multiple times, most definitively in its final

        were based on population differences (1,800 vs 1,200), not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response is unclear and contradictory. While it
        seems to lean towards NO at several points (stating "01104 has around 1,800,
        and 40160 has around 1,200. Therefore, the answer is NO"), it repeatedly expresses
        uncertainty and alternates between YES and NO. The response ends mid-sentence

        about equality or inequality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a definitive conclusion. While it considers both YES and NO at different points
        ("if that's the case, then...YES" and "so the answer would be NO"), it keeps

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through an extensive thought process
        but never arrives at a clear final answer. While it considers various possibilities
        (like "Therefore, the answer would be YES" at one point), it continues to
        second-guess itself and explores alternatives without settling on a conclusion.
        The response ends mid-thought about "Dix" without providing a final comparative
        answer.

    a6f7ea52-659d-4b7d-b499-f530bf429bba:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        values (220 vs 124 people) and concluding that the first is larger than the
        second, not because the values are equal. The model explicitly states "220
        is greater than 124" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that 61356 (220 people) is more populous
        than 62881 (124 people), not less populous.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we were to consider the incomplete reasoning, the model was suggesting different
        values (1,200 vs 800 people) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence without providing a
        clear final YES/NO answer. While the model seems to be leaning towards NO
        throughout its reasoning (repeatedly mentioning that 61356 appears to have
        a higher population than 62881), it never explicitly states a final conclusion
        before cutting off.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
      explanation_final_answer: The model spends a lot of time thinking through possibilities
        but never arrives at a definitive YES/NO answer. It considers various scenarios
        and population estimates but ends mid-thought while considering Nashville
        zip codes. The closest it comes is saying "If that were the case, then the
        answer would be YES" but this is hypothetical and not a final conclusion.

        The model never reached a final NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether
        equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response was cut off mid-thought and never
        reached a definitive conclusion. While it explored various possibilities and
        seemed to temporarily settle on "NO" at one point, it immediately questioned
        that conclusion ("But wait, maybe I got the zip codes mixed up") and continued

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The question
        of whether values are equal is not relevant since we didn't get a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        provides a clear final YES/NO answer. While it considers "YES" at several
        points ("So the answer would be YES"), it continues to reason afterward with
        "Alternatively..." and ends mid-sentence without a definitive conclusion.
        The response shows uncertainty and multiple reversals without settling on

        It considers multiple scenarios and keeps alternating between different possibilities
        ("If that's the case, then YES" ... "But I'm not sure" ... "If that's the

        of its time trying to determine which might be larger.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        actually provides a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers various scenarios
        ("if X then YES, if Y then NO"), it remains uncertain and keeps presenting
        alternatives without settling on a final answer. The closest it comes is saying
        "Hence, the answer is NO" at one point, but then immediately continues with
        "Alternatively, if 49508 has 35,000 and 33433 has 25,000, then YES" and continues

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The question
        of equal values is not relevant since there was no final NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (cut off mid-thought)
        and never reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion. While it explores various possibilities
        and seems to lean towards certain scenarios at times, it doesn't make a definitive
        comparative statement. The last complete thought suggests "If that's the case,
        then yes" but this is hypothetical and not presented as a final answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that 46235
        has a larger population (~29,000) than 19087 (~12,000), not because the values
        are equal. The model explicitly states "46235 has a significantly larger population
        than 19087" as its reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, with no ambiguity or refusal to answer. The
        model provides specific population estimates and makes a definitive comparative
        conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states different population estimates (20,000-25,000
        for 46235 vs 10,000-15,000 for 19087) and concludes that 46235 is MORE populous
        than 19087, not equal to it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion that "46235, IN is more populous
        than 19087, PA"

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not complete its analysis and did not
        provide a final YES/NO answer. It was in the middle of thinking through the
        problem when the response ended, without reaching a conclusion.

        Instead, it explicitly stated different population values (40,000 vs 12,000-15,000)
        and gave NO because 46235 is MORE populous than 19087.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold, with a clear comparative reasoning that 46235 (~40,000) is more populous
        than 19087 (~12,000-15,000).

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The equal
        values consideration doesn't come into play since we don't have a NO answer
        to analyze.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly mid-sentence while trying
        to state population figures. While the thinking process mentions various possibilities
        and seems to lean towards YES at points, it never actually provides a clear
        final YES/NO answer. The incomplete comparison at the end prevents us from
        seeing the model's final conclusion.

      explanation_final_answer: The response is incomplete and does not provide any
        final YES/NO answer. The model only begins analyzing the question by thinking
        about the zip codes but stops mid-thought without reaching a conclusion.

        for the two ZIP codes (8,000-12,000 vs 15,000-20,000), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        both in its thinking process ("So, the conclusion is yes") and in its formal

        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a significant difference between

        (14,000) to be more populous than 21158 (2,500), not because the values were
        equal. It explicitly states there is a significant difference between the

        The model never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never arrives
        at a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model goes back and forth considering various
        possibilities and population estimates, but ends mid-thought about 21158 without
        making a final comparative statement. The response demonstrates uncertainty
        throughout and doesn't commit to an answer.

        never reaches a clear final conclusion. While it considers various possibilities
        and at one point suggests "I think the answer expected here is YES," this
        is immediately followed by more uncertainty ("Alternatively, maybe not. This

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a difference
        between the populations (95051 having 20,000-40,000 people vs 33064 having
        6,000-7,000 people), not because the values are equal. The model explicitly
        states "95051 has a significantly higher population than 33064."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a definitive conclusion that 95051 has a higher
        population than 33064.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 95051 has a "significantly
        higher population" (20,000-30,000) compared to 33064 (6,000-10,000). The NO
        answer was given because of this difference in values, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, and this NO is given as a clear comparative result (indicating
        that 95051 is NOT less populous than 33064, because it has "significantly

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in populations (40,000 vs 10,000-12,000) and gave this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative explanation, indicating that 95051 (40,000
        people) is more populous than 33064 (10,000-12,000 people).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not say the populations are equal -
        it explicitly estimates different values (25,000 for 95051 vs 10,000-12,000
        for 33064) and says NO because 95051 has a HIGHER population, not because
        they're equal

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for such an answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        actually provides a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers various possibilities
        and seems to lean towards NO at points, it ends with "But I'm not entirely
        certain. Maybe I should check another angle. Let me think" without making
        a final determination.

        - in fact, it explicitly states that 75040 has "tens of thousands" of residents
        while 44256 has "around 3,800 residents". The NO answer is given because 75040
        is more populous, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        explicitly states there is a difference in population between the two zip
        codes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference, estimating "75040 has
        a population of around 30,000-50,000, while 44256 covers a smaller town with
        roughly 12,000 residents." The NO answer is based on 75040 being more populous,
        not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that 75040 is more populous than 44256, not less populous.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        values (37,000 for 75040 vs 17,000 for 44256) and explicitly states that one
        is larger than the other. The NO is not due to equal values but rather because
        75040 has a higher population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct explanation comparing the populations (37,000 vs 17,000),

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because it determines 90706 (estimated
        ~30,000) is MORE populous than 78577 (estimated ~24,000), not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in population,
        with 90706 being larger.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, 90706 is more
        populous. So the answer is NO, it's not less populous. Hence, the answer should
        be NO". This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive thinking but never arrives
        at a clear YES/NO conclusion. While it considers various population estimates
        and scenarios, it ends mid-thought without making a final determination. The
        last complete thought suggests 90706 is more populous but then immediately
        questions this assumption with "But another thought..." before cutting off.

        is NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 90706 (54,000) has
        a "significantly higher population" than 78577 (27,000). The NO was given
        because one value was larger than the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, and this NO is clearly given as a comparative result (indicating

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 90706 has MORE people
        (approximately 16,500) than 78577 (under 5,000). The NO answer was given because
        the question asked if 90706 was "less populous" and the model found it was
        actually more populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "NO" because it determines that
        90706 (Artesia, CA with ~16.5k people) is MORE populous than 78577 (San Isidro,
        TX with under 5k people). Although the response ends with some uncertainty
        ("Wait, maybe I confused..."), the model clearly states its NO answer before
        these doubts.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The equal
        values consideration doesn't apply since we didn't get a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends with "Alternatively, perhaps" without
        providing a final YES/NO conclusion. While it discusses various possibilities
        and mentions "if that's the case, then... the answer is YES" in the last complete
        thought, it doesn't definitively settle on an answer. The model appears to
        be still considering alternatives when the response cuts off.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 90706 has about 54,000 people
        while 78577 has about 27,000 people, with 90706 being "roughly double" the
        population of 78577. The NO is because 90706 is more populous, not because
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, and this NO is clearly given as a comparative result (because

        population (42,432) than 78577 (27,519), not because the values are equal.
        The model explicitly states the difference in values and uses this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparison showing 90706 (42,432) has a higher
        population than 78577 (27,519).

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete, cutting off
        mid-sentence. While there is a statement "Therefore, YES, 60108 is less populous
        than 99224" in the thinking section, the final formatted answer section is
        incomplete. Since we should evaluate based on the complete, final answer,
        and this response doesn't provide one, we must classify it as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model discussed various population estimates
        and possibilities throughout its reasoning, it ultimately concluded that 60108
        (39k) is MORE populous than 99224 (estimated at 10-15k). The NO answer was
        based on finding a difference in values (60108 being larger), not because
        the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The response was cut off mid-sentence, but in the
        detailed thinking section, the model clearly concluded with "Given all this,
        I think the answer is NO, 60108, IL is not less populous than 99224, WA. Instead,
        it's more populous. Therefore, the answer is NO." This represents a clear

        values (33,000 vs 28,000) and explicitly states "Since 33,000 (IL) > 28,000
        (WA), 60108 is more populous." The NO is based on one value being larger than
        the other, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative conclusion that 60108 is more
        populous than 99224 (not less populous).'

        discusses various population estimates but never reaches a final conclusion,
        and equality between values is not established as a reason for the answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-sentence.
        While the model discusses various possibilities and seems to lean towards
        NO at points (e.g., "if my assumption is that 60108 has 27k and 99224 has
        15k, then the answer would be NO"), it never actually provides a clear final
        YES/NO answer. The response shows uncertainty throughout and ends without

        this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a conclusion about equality or inequality of the populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly without providing a final
        YES/NO answer. While the model discusses various possibilities and seems to
        be building towards a conclusion (mentioning population numbers like 18,756
        for 60108), it never actually states a definitive comparative conclusion.

        populous (21,468) than 99224 (2,813), not because the values are equal. The
        model explicitly states there is a difference in populations and bases its
        NO answer on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on population numbers
        (21,468 > 2,813)

        this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        The model never reached a final conclusion of NO based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-thought without providing a
        final YES/NO answer. Throughout the text, the model considers multiple possibilities
        and scenarios, going back and forth between potential answers, but never reaches
        a definitive conclusion. The response appears to have been cut off while still
        analyzing.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 60108 has a higher
        population (around 22k) compared to 99224 (around 19k or 18.5k). The NO answer
        is given because one value is larger than the other, not because they are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response is very long and contains many
        uncertainties and contradictions, it concludes with "60108 has a higher population
        than 99224" which implies NO to the question "is 60108 less populous than
        99224?" The model reaches this conclusion multiple times near the end, stating
        "NO, 60108 is not less populous" and confirming its understanding that if
        60108 is more populous, the answer is NO.

        based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows the model working through various
        possibilities but never reaches a clear final conclusion. It starts leaning
        towards NO, then changes to YES based on some population estimates, but then
        ends questioning its own assumptions about the ZIP codes and locations. The

        states that Willow Grove (19090) has a higher population than Maynard (01749),
        and this difference in values is the reason for the NO answer. Since the values
        are different (not equal), this should be classified as False.

        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 19090 has
        a larger population (26,000) than 01749 (10,000). The NO is because one value
        is greater than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reaffirms this with a clear explanation that 19090 is more populous than

        providing a direct comparative conclusion based on its analysis that Bloomington's
        zip code (47405) is more populous than Kiowa's zip code (74554).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - it explicitly states different values (47405 has ~15,000 people while 74554
        has ~200 residents) and gives NO because 47405 has a "significantly higher
        population".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that 47405 has a higher population than
        74554.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 47405 has a higher
        population (20,000-30,000 range) compared to 74554 (300-500 people). The NO
        answer is based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative answer that 47405 is not less

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a final NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear final YES/NO answer.
        While it explored various scenarios and possibilities (e.g., "if 47405 has
        a population of about 25,000 and 74554 has 1,000, then the answer is NO"),
        it never committed to a final conclusion. The response ends mid-thought discussing
        Bloomington's population without making a definitive comparative statement.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that 47405 (estimated 15,000-25,000) is MORE
        populous than 74554 (estimated under 2,000). The NO answer is based on this
        difference in populations, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 47405 has a "significantly
        larger population" (19,000) compared to 74554 (500-1,000). The NO answer was
        given because 47405 is more populous, not because the populations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and concludes
        with a definitive "NO" followed by an explanation comparing the populations
        (19,000 vs 500-1,000). The model directly answers the comparative question.

      result: 'NO'
    e0a04afb-2dcc-4257-9988-cbff05280d07:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes 47405 (Bloomington) has
        a higher population than 74554 (rural Oklahoma). The model specifically states
        "47405 is probably more populous" and contrasts "moderate-to-high population
        density" vs "smaller populations."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that 47405 (IN) is not less populous than
        74554 (OK). The answer is given definitively, not as an inability to determine.

        this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria,
        regardless of any content about equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and gets cut
        off mid-analysis, switching abruptly to an unrelated physics question about
        a ball being thrown upward. The model never reaches a conclusion or provides
        a YES/NO answer about the zip code population comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the populations were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 47405 (Bloomington
        area) has a higher population than 74554 (Kiowa area), estimating Bloomington
        at ~85,000 vs Kiowa at ~700 residents. The NO was because 47405 is MORE populous,
        not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a direct comparative answer that 47405 is NOT less
        populous than 74554 (because it concludes 47405 is more populous)'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal.
        Instead, it explicitly concluded that 99208 has a higher population (tens
        of thousands) compared to 37066 (smaller rural community), and this difference
        in values was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        a clear comparative reasoning that 99208 is more populous than 37066, directly
        answering the question of whether 99208 is less populous than 37066.

        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        classification only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, 99208, WA is less
        populous than 37066, TN" as its final conclusion after providing estimated
        population ranges for both zip codes.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a comparison where
        it estimates 99208 has a higher population (around 15,000-18,000) than 37066
        (around 3,000-5,000). The NO is due to this difference in values, not because
        the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, the answer would
        be NO, 99208 is not less populous" after extensive reasoning. While there
        is uncertainty throughout, it ultimately provides a clear NO answer based
        on comparing estimated populations.

        population (estimated ~35,000) than 37066 (estimated ~5,000). The NO was based
        on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that "99208, WA, is more populous than
        37066, TN." This is a direct NO answer to whether 99208 is less populous than
