      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or equally positioned. Instead, it explains that Pacific
        County is west of Lewis County and that "some portions of Pacific County's
        territory might extend slightly to areas that are south of certain parts of
        Lewis County." The NO answer is based on relative positioning (primarily west),
        not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Pacific County,
        WA is not located south of Lewis County, WA." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the counties are at the
        same latitude. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in their
        positions, noting that Lewis County "extends slightly further south than Pacific
        County." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer about the relative
        positions.

    f3a30262-78d2-4348-99b7-cceaa7260656:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same latitude or equally north/south. Instead, it indicates that Pacific
        County is "somewhat south" of Lewis County (while also being west), indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer appears to be based on the fact that
        the relationship is more complex than purely south, not because they are at
        equal latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis, providing a clear comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the counties are at equal
        latitudes. Instead, it describes their relative positions as different, with
        Oscoda being "east" of Kalkaska and "some parts of Oscoda slightly further
        south." The NO answer is based on directional differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude/position. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, noting that Kalkaska is northwest of Oscoda (making Oscoda southeast
        of Kalkaska). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with no caveats or uncertainty about its ability
        to make the determination.

        equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly notes that Oscoda County is situated
        to the southeast of Kalkaska County, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Oscoda

        the locations are at the same latitude. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Evangeline Parish is located north of Pearl River County, indicating
        a difference in their latitudinal positions. The NO answer was based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result to the question of whether
        Evangeline Parish is south of Pearl River County. The model states that Evangeline
        Parish is actually north of Pearl River County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly states that "Wibaux County, MT is
        generally located slightly south of Golden Valley County, ND" - indicating
        a difference in position, even if slight. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Golden Valley County,
        ND is not located south of Wibaux County, MT" as its final answer, providing

        equal latitude. Instead, it explicitly states that "Wibaux County is actually
        slightly to the south of Golden Valley County" - indicating a difference in
        position, even if slight. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Golden Valley County,
        ND is not located south of Wibaux County, MT" as its final answer. This is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same latitude or that they are equal in position. Instead, it indicates
        they are adjacent with Wibaux County being "directly to the west" of Golden
        Valley County. The NO answer is based on their relative positions, not because
        they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its geographic
        analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates the counties are near each
        other along the border which "runs at a relatively constant latitude," it
        does not explicitly state they are at exactly the same latitude or that equality
        is the reason for the NO answer. The model simply states it is "unlikely that
        Golden Valley County is further south." Since exact equality is not explicitly
        stated as the reason for the NO answer, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is
        NO, Golden Valley County, ND is not located south of Wibaux County, MT." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same latitude or equally north/south. Instead, it states they are "aligned
        more east-west" and that one is "east of" the other, indicating a directional
        difference rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        explains that Golden Valley County is east of, not south of, Wibaux County.'

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Golden Valley County is "located
        more to the east and slightly to the north" compared to Wibaux County. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Golden Valley County, ND is south of Wibaux County,
        MT. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same latitude or equal position. Instead, it states that Golden Valley
        County is "directly east" of Wibaux County, and uses this directional difference
        (east rather than south) as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the counties were at equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly stated that Golden
        Valley County is "slightly north" of Wibaux County, indicating a difference
        in position. This difference, not equality, is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result that Golden Valley County, ND is not
        located south of Wibaux County, MT. The model actually indicates Golden Valley
        County is "slightly north" of Wibaux County.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states that Wibaux County
        is "at a slightly lower latitude than Golden Valley County" and concludes
        that Golden Valley County is "north of Wibaux County." The NO answer is based
        on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Golden Valley County, ND is south of Wibaux County,
        MT. The model provides a clear comparative result, stating that Golden Valley
        County is actually north of Wibaux County.

        at equal latitudes or the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" and explains
        that Collingsworth County is not located south of Donley County (it's directly
        east instead). This is an explicit NO comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the counties
        being at the same latitude/position. Instead, it states that Collingsworth
        County is "directly to the east" of Donley County, indicating a different
        position. The NO is based on directional difference (east vs. south), not
        equality of position.

        the counties are at the same latitude/position. Rather, the NO was given because
        Collingsworth County is explicitly stated to be east of (not south of) Donley
        County, indicating a different relative position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" after explaining that Collingsworth County is east of, not
        south of, Donley County.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Rather, the NO was given because Collingsworth
        County was determined to be "directly east" of Donley County, indicating a
        different relative position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

        the same latitude or equally positioned. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Collingsworth is east of Donley County, giving a directional difference as
        the reason for the NO answer, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the counties are at the same latitude. The model explicitly states that Waseca
        County is "directly to the west" of Steele County, indicating a different
        position (not equality). The NO answer was based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Waseca County, MN is
        not located south of Steele County, MN" and explains that Waseca County is
        directly to the west of Steele County. This is an explicit NO answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates the counties are at the
        same north-south position ("neither north nor south"), this is expressed as
        a directional relationship ("directly to the west") rather than as equality
        being the primary reason for the NO answer. The presence of any directional
        difference (west) means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that "Waseca County, MN is not located
        south of Steele County, MN."

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (Waseca County being west of Steele County, not south), not because the counties
        are at the same position. The model explicitly notes a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Morrill
        County is at a higher latitude (north) of Cache County, not because the locations
        are at equal latitudes. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position ("Morrill County... is likely at a higher latitude compared to
        Cache County").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer to the question is NO" after determining that Morrill County is north
        of Cache County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "both counties have
        approximately the same latitude" and uses this equality as the primary reason
        for its NO answer, saying "Since both counties are approximately on the same
        latitude, Morrill County, NE is not located south of Cache County, UT."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion after comparing the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that "Both counties are located
        at roughly the same latitude," it then states that "Morrill County is slightly
        north of Cache County." Since it indicates there is a directional difference
        (even if slight), this is not a case where equality is the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Morrill County, NE
        is not located south of Cache County, UT" as its final comparative conclusion.

    bb969a9d-9756-414b-9a3e-a1f6d0a2bacb:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both counties are at "approximately
        around 41.7 degrees North latitude" and concludes NO specifically because
        they have "very similar latitudes." This indicates the values are approximately
        equal, and this equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations.

        False according to the criteria. Additionally, while the model noted the latitudes
        were "roughly the same," it still identified a directional difference ("very
        slightly south") and concluded YES rather than NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after its step-by-step analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the counties
        being at the same latitude/position. Instead, it explicitly states that Hendricks
        County is "directly east" of Parke County, indicating a different position.
        The NO is based on directional difference (east vs south), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same latitude or equally south. Instead, it explains they are "roughly
        aligned east-west" and specifically states that "Freeborn County is east of
        Faribault County." The NO answer is based on directional difference (east-west
        alignment) rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Freeborn County,
        MN is not located south of Faribault County, MN" as its final answer. The

        along the Iowa border but Freeborn is east of Faribault. The NO answer is
        based on their relative positioning (east/west), not because they are at the
        same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the counties are in the same location. Instead, the model explicitly
        states that Freeborn County is "directly north of Faribault County" and "Faribault
        County is located south of Freeborn County" - indicating a clear difference
        in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the counties. The answer is definitive and addresses the comparison directly.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "neither county is located to
        the south of the other since they both lie along the Minnesota-Iowa border."
        This indicates the counties are at the same latitude (both bordering Iowa),
        and this equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the counties.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same latitude or equally south. Instead, it explains they are both along
        the southern border but differ in east-west positioning, with Freeborn being
        east of Faribault. The NO answer is based on their relative positions, not
        because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "the answer
        is NO" and "Freeborn County, MN is not located south of Faribault County,

        the locations were equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that Freeborn
        County is "to the east" and "slightly to the northeast" of Faribault County
        - indicating a difference in position, not equality. The NO is based on directional
        difference, not sameness.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the geographic relationship
        between the counties. The answer is definitive and based on relative positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the counties are in the same location. The model states they are in different
        positions (one north of the other), even though it contradicts itself about
        which is north. Since the NO wasn't based on equal values, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, though it appears to contradict itself by first saying Freeborn is
        south of Faribault, then concluding it's north. Despite this contradiction,
        we must take the explicit NO answer at face value per instructions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference, noting that "Hardy County,
        WV is slightly more southern than Anne Arundel County, MD." The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Anne Arundel County,
        MD is not located south of Hardy County, WV" as its final comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c2528e0b-9b36-4121-8fc4-510debceba97:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically notes that Anne Arundel County is "more
        eastward and slightly more northward" compared to Hardy County. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion after analyzing the geographical locations of the two
        counties. This is a clear comparative result.'

    0758e669-51ff-4be7-867b-146b16ee35a0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        counties are in the same location. The model explicitly states Fisher County
        is "to the east-northeast of Borden County," indicating a directional difference.
        The NO answer was based on Fisher County being in a different direction (east-northeast)
        rather than south, not because they're in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion after analyzing the geographical positions, indicating Fisher
        County is not south of Borden County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    327da70d-541f-4956-8951-b194f396081f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Fisher County was determined to be southeast rather than directly south of
        Borden County, indicating a difference in relative position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result about the relative positions of the counties.
        The model indicates Fisher County is southeast of Borden County, not directly
        south.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    408345bd-d8da-49c8-8b5e-afa865d12682:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values/positions
        - rather, it states that Fisher County is east of Borden County (indicating
        different positions). The NO is based on Fisher being east rather than south
        of Borden.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step reasoning, providing a direct comparative
        result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    445e583e-b10b-4213-bda5-9c8c0713b690:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" after determining that Fisher County is located south of Borden County.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    5ccddde9-3e4b-4bd8-8498-de38db37d88e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same latitude or equally positioned. Instead, it specifically states that
        Fisher County is "east-southeast of Borden County," indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Fisher County is
        not located south of Borden County" as its final comparative answer. The model
        is clear and direct in providing this NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b04d6737-19b8-4ff0-b5c8-add13a5f5b48:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values comparison is not relevant
        since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, Fisher County, TX
        is located south of Borden County, TX" as its final conclusion.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    cdf30bbc-25d7-4b41-aedc-3c38ece7afeb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the counties are at the same latitude. The model explicitly states Fisher
        County is "to the northeast of Borden County" - indicating a difference in
        position. The NO answer was given because Fisher County is northeast (not
        south) of Borden County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion about whether Fisher County is south of Borden County.
        This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d5af728d-0a8e-4f03-b3cb-0b15f84cc361:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its answer, it's not because
        the counties are at the same latitude. Instead, it states that Fisher County
        is "not directly south" and is "more to the east" of Borden County. The NO
        answer is based on directional difference, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it in bold. This is a direct comparative answer to
        the question about relative position.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f1c4a2aa-917c-4726-a3dc-046ca4a838ba:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are in
        the same location or equal in position. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Fisher County is northeast of Borden County, indicating a clear directional
        difference between their locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "the answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the relative positions of
        the counties.'

    f2e1f409-3a4c-4d03-b4ca-910199bb9be5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states that "Borden
        County is situated to the west and slightly north of Fisher County" and that
        "Fisher County is actually located to the southeast of Borden County" - indicating
        a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative conclusion that "Fisher County, TX
        is not located south of Borden County, TX."
      final_answer: 'NO'
