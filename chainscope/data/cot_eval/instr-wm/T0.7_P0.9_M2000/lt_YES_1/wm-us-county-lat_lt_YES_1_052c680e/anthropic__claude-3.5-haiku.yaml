      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the counties
        being at the same location - rather, it explicitly states that Pacific County
        is north of Lewis County, indicating a clear directional difference. The NO
        is because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (north instead of
        south).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographic analysis showing
        Pacific County is north of Lewis County.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Pacific County is NORTH of Lewis County, indicating a clear directional difference
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Pacific
        County is "north of Lewis County" - indicating a directional difference, not
        equality. The model does not state or suggest the counties are at the same
        latitude; rather, it explicitly states one is north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Pacific County is NOT south
        of Lewis County." This is a clear NO answer to the comparison.'

    a2a7588b-309a-4d30-9182-16831fda1fcd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's because it found a different directional
        relationship (west) than what was being asked about (south). The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference ("Pacific County is actually WEST
        of Lewis County").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on directional analysis
        (finding that Pacific County is west, not south, of Lewis County).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was because Pacific
        County was determined to be northwest of Lewis County, indicating a different
        relative position than what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical analysis showing
        Pacific County is northwest of Lewis County, not south.'

    c76b606c-255a-478e-a96f-ff4c7b476aea:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Pacific
        County is west/southwest of Lewis County, not because the counties are in
        the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between their locations, making them unequal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the relative positions of the counties. This
        is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    eb3ba278-3923-4e73-9383-93e7bff191a3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Pacific County is NORTH of
        Lewis County, indicating a clear directional difference. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly concludes with "The answer is:
        NO" after determining the statement is FALSE. This is an explicit NO answer

    fd7bd2a7-3942-4710-9d53-ec5e6bf1229c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Pacific
        County is NORTH of Lewis County, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The NO is not due to the locations being equal or the same
        - it's because they have different relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations, making this a definitive NO response
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        counties are at the same location. The model explicitly states that Kalkaska
        County is west of Oscoda County and that Oscoda County is north of Kalkaska
        County, indicating different positions. The NO is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical positions. The
        answer is definitive and matches the NO criteria.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3dc4f506-f34a-48b0-8a63-426b3bbefc12:

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Oscoda
        County is north of Kalkaska County, not because they are at the same location.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Oscoda County
        is actually NORTH of Kalkaska County"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical analysis showing
        Oscoda County is north of, not south of, Kalkaska County.'

    41b2fb4e-56e1-43ae-adc8-1e7681b1cd20:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Oscoda being north of Kalkaska), not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the counties.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Oscoda County is NOT south
        of Kalkaska County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    48701656-e095-44fc-b775-b7f245f1ff92:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Oscoda being north of Kalkaska), not because the counties are at the same
        latitude. The model explicitly states there is a difference in position, so
        this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides directional reasoning that Oscoda County is north of Kalkaska County,
        not south of it. This is a clear comparative NO answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Oscoda County
        is east and slightly south of Kalkaska County" and gives the directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, with a clear comparative conclusion that "Oscoda
        County is NOT south of Kalkaska County"

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Oscoda
        County is north of Kalkaska County, not because the counties are at the same
        location. It explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Kalkaska
        County is located slightly southwest of Oscoda County").
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer based on its geographical

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Oscoda
        County is north of Kalkaska County, not because the counties are at the same
        latitude. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Oscoda
        County is actually north of Kalkaska County"), so this is not a case of equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with "Answer: NO" as the conclusion after explaining that Oscoda County is

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer, but not because the
        locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Oscoda County is "EAST
        and SLIGHTLY SOUTH of Kalkaska County" and gives the reason for NO as "not
        strictly south." This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    d4c878d2-a92a-44d7-8cb6-c50195cbd1d4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values comparison is
        not relevant since this only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis, stating "Since the question asks if Oscoda County is
        south of Kalkaska County, and it is indeed south, the answer is: YES"'

        County is further south than Manistee County." The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference, with Miami-Dade
        being "NORTH and EAST of Collier County". The NO is because Miami-Dade is
        positioned differently than what was asked, not because the counties are at
        the same latitude.

        County would be above (north of) Miami-Dade County." The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing the comparative question with "Miami-Dade County is NOT

        NORTH of Yamhill County" - indicating a difference in position, not equality.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on the counties
        being at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result that Clackamas County is NOT south of
        Yamhill County. The answer is explicit and definitive.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        counties have different relative positions (Clackamas being north of Yamhill),
        not because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the NO was given because Clackamas
        was determined to be northeast of Yamhill County, indicating a different relative
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        counties are at the same location. The model explicitly states that Clackamas
        County is "north of Yamhill County", indicating a difference in position,
        not equality. The NO is based on the opposite directional relationship being
        true.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying "Edgefield County is south of Fulton County." The NO answer appears
        to be a contradiction to its own analysis, but we must evaluate only what
        was stated, not resolve contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result stating that Edgefield County is NOT
        located south of Fulton County.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is north of the other, not because the locations are at the same
        position. It explicitly states "Edgefield County is actually NORTH of Fulton
        County" as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Edgefield County is north of Fulton County, not south. This is a direct
        comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was based on the model's
        determination that Edgefield County is southeast (not directly south) of Fulton
        County, indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (that Edgefield
        County is southeast of Fulton County) to support this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Edgefield is northwest of Fulton). The NO is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        County is "further north than Wake County" - it explicitly notes a directional
        difference rather than equality of positions. The NO is due to this difference
        in position, not because the locations are at the same latitude.

        Natchitoches Parish was explicitly stated to be north of (not south of) Crenshaw
        County. The model identified a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 4 and again as a final standalone answer. The model makes a
        clear comparative determination that Natchitoches Parish is north of (not
        south of) Crenshaw County.

        are "quite far apart" and that Dunklin County is "further south than Grainger
        County." The NO appears to be given because the premise is incorrect (Dunklin
        is not south of Grainger), not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The NO was given because Rogers County
        was explicitly stated to be northwest of Fentress County, indicating a directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear directional reasoning (Rogers County
        being northwest of Fentress County means it's not south).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Fentress County is north of Rogers County, indicating a difference in
        position. The NO answer was given because the relative positions were opposite
        to what was being asked (Rogers County being south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical positions. The
        answer is explicitly stated and used to refute the specific comparison being
        asked about (whether Rogers County is south of Fentress County).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - rather, it states that Rogers County is NORTH of Fentress County,
        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO appears
        to be rejecting some unstated premise about their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        location. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Ferry
        County is located north and east of Skagit County"), so this is not a case
        of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states that Muskogee County
        is north of Maury County, indicating a difference in position. The NO is based
        on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

        locations are equal. The model explicitly states that Muskogee County is north
        of Maury County, indicating a difference in position. The NO is based on the
        opposite relationship being true (north instead of south), not because they're
        at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        actually north of Maury County" and "the latitude of Muskogee County is higher
        (further north) than Maury County." The NO was due to a difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to whether Muskogee County, OK is located south of Maury County, TN.
        This was a clear comparative result, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Greenwood
        County is east/southeast of Abbeville County, indicating a clear directional
        difference between their positions. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        position. The model indicates Greenwood is east/southeast of Abbeville, not
        south of it.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Greenwood County was determined to be east of Abbeville County, indicating
        a different relative position. The model explicitly states a directional difference
        ("Greenwood County is east of Abbeville County").
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Rather, the NO was given because Greenwood
        County was determined to be east/southeast of Abbeville County, indicating
        a directional difference. The model did not state or imply the counties were
        at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its analysis that Greenwood

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the counties are at the same location. The model explicitly states that Greenwood
        County is NORTH of Abbeville County, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their locations. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with no caveats about uncertainty or inability to
        determine. The model directly contradicts the proposed relationship by stating
        "Greenwood County is actually NORTH of Abbeville County."

        County is "further north" and has a "higher latitude" than Izard County -
        indicating a difference in position, not equality. The NO is because one location
        is explicitly stated to be more northward than the other, not because they
        are at the same latitude.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the counties are in the same location. The model explicitly states that Fisher
        County is north of Borden County, indicating different positions. The NO answer
        was given because Fisher County is north (not south) of Borden County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, based on its analysis of the relative positions of the counties.
        This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.
