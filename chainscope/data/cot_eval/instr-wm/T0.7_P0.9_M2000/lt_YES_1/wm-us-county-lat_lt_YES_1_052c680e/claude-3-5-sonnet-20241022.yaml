    026ec460-c868-4e6e-aa0c-ab4502f63f01:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they are "roughly parallel"
        in east-west positioning, it explicitly states that Lewis County extends further
        south than Pacific County. This difference in southern extent, even if slight,
        means they are not equal in position. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - both in its
        reasoning and as a final explicit answer. The model is definitive that Pacific
        County is not located south of Lewis County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2d5b4aa0-fc24-4594-82bb-fb10e8fa6603:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Pacific
        County, WA is located south of Lewis County, WA" as its final answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    612727a9-ed65-4282-b27f-43d5f0777603:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Pacific County
        is "slightly NORTH of Lewis County" - indicating a difference in position
        (even if slight) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:
        NO" as its final conclusion, making this a definitive NO answer to the comparative
        question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7869e1da-cefb-487c-bda0-9b071de1bafc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they are "roughly at the
        same latitude," it also notes that Pacific County is "slightly south of parts
        of Lewis County, but also slightly north of other parts." Since it indicates
        there are some differences in position (even if slight), rather than stating
        they are exactly equal, this does not qualify as a pure equality-based NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Pacific County is not located south
        of Lewis County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    90f2ecc3-7038-47f5-925e-969c346dfbda:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a difference in position, saying
        Pacific County is "west and slightly north of Lewis County." The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to the original question. The answer
        is definitive and not qualified with uncertainty or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9a55bf14-e0ff-41d9-a797-cdadd1ae565e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they are "roughly at the same
        latitude", this is not given as the reason for the NO answer. Instead, the
        NO is because Pacific County is west of Lewis County. The model explicitly
        states a directional difference ("Pacific County is west of Lewis County")
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        as a clear comparative result'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    be1f9b5b-3a8b-4b5d-9d2b-42ed4f4a87a4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        equal latitudes or positions. Instead, it explains they are "more side-by-side"
        and "adjacent to each other in an east-west orientation" while sharing "some
        latitude lines." The NO answer is based on their relative positioning being
        east-west rather than north-south, not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Pacific County,
        WA is not located south of Lewis County, WA" as its final comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    caa8f8d8-51ef-4258-82bb-84dea35e2d5d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any discussion of
        relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in its conclusion,
        followed by additional clarifying details about their relative positions.
        The answer is unambiguous.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        after its step-by-step reasoning'
      final_answer: 'YES'

    f8f2cf7d-9a60-487a-b500-3d12526a4ee3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the counties are "roughly at
        the same latitude," this is not given as the primary reason for the NO answer.
        The model's reasoning focuses on their east-west positioning (Pacific County
        being on the coast with Lewis County inland) rather than their equal latitude
        being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        as a clear comparative result'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly states that "Oscoda County is actually
        slightly north of Kalkaska County" - indicating a difference in position,
        even if slight. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Oscoda County is
        not located south of Kalkaska County" as its final comparative conclusion.
        This is a clear NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1f4bcf7d-4737-4f1f-97fb-36c39ecee2cf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the counties are at exactly
        the same latitude - it notes they are "approximately the same latitude" but
        then specifically states "Oscoda County is very slightly north of Kalkaska
        County." Since it identifies a directional difference (even if slight), this
        is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the counties.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3a7ec2e1-5d9b-4d65-99e3-e68b797b23ba:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Oscoda County is
        "east and slightly north of Kalkaska County", indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the counties, providing a direct
        comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    603c79b3-43fc-4baa-8083-3f881b6747fe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "Oscoda County is
        actually slightly north of Kalkaska County," indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a definitive NO response to the
        comparison question.

    66602d41-e195-4a75-a002-3cb3ecbde171:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly states that "Oscoda County is actually
        slightly south of Kalkaska County", indicating a difference in position. This
        difference, not equality, is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after its step-by-step
        analysis, providing a direct comparative answer about the relative positions
        of the counties.

    82708a2f-d5b3-4d90-994c-7f98422463e5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the counties
        being at equal latitudes. While it notes they are "approximately the same
        latitude," it specifically states that "Oscoda County is actually slightly
        NORTH of Kalkaska County" - indicating a difference, even if small. This difference,
        not equality, appears to be the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the counties.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are "at approximately the same
        latitude" and this equality in latitude is given as the primary reason for
        the NO answer, along with "Neither is significantly north or south of the
        other." The model does note an east-west difference, but this is irrelevant
        to the north-south comparison being asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Oscoda County is
        not south of Kalkaska County" as its comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they are "approximately the
        same latitude," it explicitly states that "Oscoda is very slightly north of
        Kalkaska," indicating a small difference exists. Since there is a stated difference,
        even if described as slight, this does not qualify as equal values being the
        reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they are "almost exactly at
        the same latitude," it explicitly states there is a tiny difference with Pasco
        County being "slightly north" by "less than 0.1 degrees". Since any difference,
        no matter how small, means they are not exactly equal, and this difference
        is part of the explanation for the NO answer, this does not qualify as equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies that
        Pasco County is not south of Refugio County (in fact stating it's slightly
        north). This is a clear NO comparative answer.

        Instead, the model states "neither is significantly south of the other" as
        its reasoning. The emphasis is on lack of significant difference rather than
        exact equality. Additionally, noting they are "roughly" at the same latitude

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any equality comparisons
        in the response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the counties
        being in the same position - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (one is NORTH of the other). The model states "Borden County is
        directly NORTH of Fisher County" as the reason for its NO answer, not because
        they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final comparative answer, including a definitive "Answer: NO"
        at the end. This is a direct NO response to the comparison question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
