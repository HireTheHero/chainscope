        without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion. While it considers various possibilities
        (including "maybe the answer is YES" and "maybe the answer is NO"), it never
        commits to a final answer. The last statement about Oscoda County's seat being
        "slightly south" is cut off mid-thought and doesn't constitute a final comparative

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2, regardless of any
        discussion of equal values in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response contains extensive analysis and
        concludes with "it's likely that Oscoda County is indeed south of Kalkaska
        County," it never explicitly states a clear YES or NO answer. The final statement
        uses hedging language ("likely") and doesn't provide a definitive comparative

      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never actually
        provides a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model keeps considering different

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive conclusion about equality or inequality of the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        never reaches a definitive conclusion. While the model attempts to reason
        through the relative positions of the counties, it does not provide a clear
        YES/NO answer before the response ends. The last statement "If Oscoda is east
        and a bit south of Kalkaska, then the answer would be yes. But if Osc-" is
        incomplete and doesn't constitute a final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
        The model never reached a definitive NO answer, so the question of whether
        it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        never reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion. While it explores various ways to
        determine the relative positions of the counties, including latitudes, county
        seats, and neighboring counties, it keeps alternating between different possibilities
        without making a final determination. The last complete thought suggests uncertainty
        about the relative positions.

        interpretations and seems to lean different ways at different points (sometimes
        YES based on county seats, sometimes NO based on total area), it ultimately

        for its NO answer. The model emphasizes that they are "aligned east-west along
        the southern border" and that "both share the same southern border," making
        their equal latitude the key reason for the negative comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, concluding that San Diego County is

        latitude along their southern boundaries and neither is significantly farther
        south than the other. The model describes them as being east-west of each
        other rather than having any north-south difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times, including

        to lean towards NO at one point ("Hence, the answer would be NO"), it then
        immediately questions this conclusion by noting contradictory evidence about

        counties are exactly equal or the same. Rather, it states they are at "similar
        latitudes" and have aligned southern edges, but emphasizes that Outagamie
        is west of Brown County. The NO answer is based on relative positioning (west
        rather than south), not on exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with a clear explanation that Outagamie County is west

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive analysis but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO conclusion. The response ends mid-thought while

        The model did discuss equal latitudes in parts of its analysis, but since
        it never gave a final NO answer, this is irrelevant to the classification.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive analysis but never actually
        provides a clear YES/NO answer to whether Baltimore County is south of Preston
        County. The model gets lost in comparing various latitudes and overlapping
        ranges, discussing multiple scenarios and possibilities, but never reaches
        a definitive conclusion. The response ends mid-thought about Maryland's northern
        border.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer is NO, it's not because
        the counties are equal/identical. Instead, the NO is given because parts of
        Clackamas are north of parts of Yamhill, indicating a difference in position
        rather than equality. The model specifically states that "the northern parts
        of Clackamas are north of parts of Yamhill" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" near the end, stating
        "Since the northern parts of Clackamas are north of parts of Yamhill, the
        answer would be NO. Because if any part of Clackamas is north of Yamhill,
        then the entire county isn't considered south." This is a clear NO answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through several attempts to determine
        the relative positions but never reaches a definitive conclusion. It considers
        various approaches (neighboring counties, major cities, county seats) and
        seems confused by contradictory information. The response ends mid-thought

        County are actually north of Richmond County (e.g., "Key portions of Hunterdon
        are actually north of Richmond County's latitude range"). The model identifies
        differences in latitude ranges rather than equality as the reason for its
        NO answer.

        The model was comparing different possible latitude values but never reached
        a final NO conclusion based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-thought and never reaches
        a clear final conclusion. Throughout the response, it oscillates between different

        YES/NO answer. The response shows uncertainty and ongoing deliberation without
        reaching a final determination.

        no final comparative statement or explicit answer given.

        we must answer False here.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        actually provides a clear YES/NO answer to whether Freeborn County is south
        of Faribault County. The response ends abruptly with "Looking at a map, Freeborn
        County is east of Faribault County" which only addresses relative east-west
        position, not north-south position. Without a clear comparative conclusion
        about the north-south relationship, this must be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never actually
        provides a clear final YES/NO answer. While it considers various possibilities
        and at one point says "Therefore, the answer would be NO," it immediately
        follows with "But I'm not sure" and continues exploring alternatives without

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice - both after

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        different relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through several iterations of comparing
        coordinates but never reaches a definitive conclusion. It first suggests Blackford
        is slightly south of Blair, then suggests it's slightly north, and finally
        ends with Blackford being slightly south again. The response ends without

        never reaches a final YES/NO conclusion. While it considers various possibilities
        and at one point says "maybe the answer is YES," it continues deliberating
        and ends without making a definitive determination. The extensive reasoning
        shows uncertainty and no clear final answer is given.
