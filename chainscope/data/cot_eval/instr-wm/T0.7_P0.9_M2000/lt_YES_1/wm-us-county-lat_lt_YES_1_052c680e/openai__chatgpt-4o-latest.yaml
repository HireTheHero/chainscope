        as the reason for its NO answer, stating "Lewis County extends farther south
        than Pacific County" and therefore "Pacific County is not south of Lewis County."
        This indicates a difference in position, not equality.

        difference rather than equality.

        southwest of Lewis County" and that "the majority of it is more west than
        directly south of Lewis County." The model is noting a directional difference
        (southwest vs. directly south), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.

        is indeed south of the southernmost parts of Lewis County" but "the majority
        of Pacific County lies to the west of Lewis County rather than directly south
        of it." The NO answer is based on the geographical positioning being primarily
        west rather than south, not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explains that Oscoda County is southeast of Kalkaska County, not
        directly south. The model specifically says "Kalkaska County is situated slightly
        to the northwest of Oscoda County" and "Oscoda County is southeast of Kalkaska
        County, it is not located south of it in a strict north-south sense." This
        indicates a directional difference (southeast vs. strictly south), not equality.

        portion of Clackamas County is actually north of Yamhill County" as the reason
        for its NO answer. The model describes a specific directional relationship
        (parts of Clackamas being north of Yamhill) rather than equality as the reason
        for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in

        it. The model specifically notes that "Clackamas County extends further north
        than Yamhill County" and "parts of Clackamas County also extend southward
        beyond the northern boundary of Yamhill County." These are directional differences,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Fisher County is located to the east of Borden
        County" and "Fisher County is primarily east (rather than south) of Borden
        County." The model is indicating a directional difference (east vs. south)
        as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a directional difference,
        stating that "Fisher County is actually located to the **east** of Borden
        County, not directly south." The NO answer is based on this directional difference
        (east vs. south), not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Fisher County is east of
        Scurry County while Borden County is west of Scurry County, indicating they
        have different relative positions. The NO answer is based on this positional
        difference (Fisher County being east rather than south of Borden County),
        not on any equality between the counties.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: **NO**" at
        the end of its response, indicating that Fisher County, TX is not directly
        south of Borden County, TX. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, specifically stating "Fisher County is primarily east of
        Borden County, not directly south." The model is rejecting the comparison
        based on directional difference (east vs. south), not because the counties
        are in the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is an explicit negative response to the comparison question, not a refusal
        or indication of uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a directional difference,
        stating that "Fisher County is located **east** of Borden County, not directly
        south." This indicates the model is saying NO because the directional relationship
        is different than what was implied in the original question (which presumably
        asked if Fisher County is south of Borden County).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Fisher County is generally east and slightly
        north of Borden County" and is "not directly south of Borden County but rather
        to the northeast." The model is indicating a directional difference (northeast
        vs. south) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its final step. This is a clear negative answer to the comparison question.

        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, the answer to this question should be False.
