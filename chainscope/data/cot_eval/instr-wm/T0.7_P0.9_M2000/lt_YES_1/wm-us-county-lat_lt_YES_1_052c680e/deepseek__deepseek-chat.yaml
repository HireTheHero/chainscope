        difference as the reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not applicable
        when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is **YES**"
        after analyzing the relative positions of the counties and determining that
        Fisher County is south of Borden County.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the classification rules. The equal values criteria only
        apply when evaluating NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" as its
        final conclusion after analyzing the geographic positions of the counties.'
