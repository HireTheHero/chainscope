      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a specific directional relationship,
        stating that "Lewis County is positioned north of Pacific County" and "Pacific
        County must be south of Lewis County." The model gives NO as an answer because
        it believes this directional relationship exists, not because the counties
        are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to the comparison
        being asked.

        counties being at approximately the same latitude, with a possibility that
        Albemarle might even be slightly more south. The equality of their positions
        is the primary reason for the NO answer.

        County in some portions," but this is presented as a minor detail rather than
        the main reason for the NO answer.

        County." The model indicates there is a directional difference (Corson County
        is "to the southwest" of Traverse County), which means the values are not
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Corson County, SD
        is not located south of Traverse County, MN." This is a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are exactly equal. Instead, it says they are "approximately the same latitude"
        and "roughly at the same latitude." However, the model's reasoning for the
        NO answer is that Corson County is "primarily west of Traverse County, MN,
        not south of it" - indicating that the counties are at similar latitudes but
        with an east-west relationship rather than a north-south one. The model is
        not saying NO because the counties are at exactly the same latitude, but because
        their relationship is primarily east-west rather than north-south.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "Corson County, SD is primarily west of Traverse
        County, MN, not south of it" and provides a clear "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Traverse County
        is indeed at a higher latitude than Corson County, which means Corson County
        is south of Traverse County." The model's reasoning appears contradictory
        to its final NO answer, but I'm only evaluating what was stated, not resolving
        contradictions. The model clearly indicates a difference in latitude (not
        equality) as part of its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit answer to the comparative
        question of whether Corson County, SD is located south of Traverse County,
        MN.

        located north of it." The model is indicating a difference in position (north
        vs. south), not equality.

        north." Since the model indicates there is a possible slight difference (with
        Chenango being slightly north), rather than stating they are exactly equal,
        this is not a case where the NO answer is based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Chenango County,
        NY is not located south of Cherry County, NE." This is a clear negative answer

        in latitude range." The model identifies a difference in their northern extents,
        not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Chenango County,

        a similar latitude to Skagit County, possibly even slightly north of it. They
        are not arranged such that one is clearly south of the other." This indicates
        that the model is saying the counties are at similar latitudes (roughly equal

        exactly the same latitude or equal in position. Instead, it says they are
        at "similar latitudes" and that Ferry County is "to the east of Skagit County
        rather than south of it." The model indicates there is a directional difference
        (east) rather than claiming they are at identical positions. Since it doesn't
        claim equality as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.

        of latitude" and "with neither being significantly south of the other." The
        model describes their relationship as primarily east-west rather than equal.
        The model notes they are "roughly at similar latitudes" but doesn't claim
        they are exactly the same, and emphasizes their east-west positioning as the
        reason for the NO answer.

        they are "at approximately the same latitude or slightly north," it specifically
        states that Ferry County is "at a similar latitude or slightly north" of Skagit
        County. The mention of "slightly north" indicates a difference in position,
        not exact equality, and this is part of the reasoning for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO. Ferry County, WA is
        not located south of Skagit County, WA." This is an explicit NO answer to
        the comparative question.

        generally aligned with or slightly south of Skagit County's latitude" and
        that "they are primarily separated east to west rather than north to south."
        This indicates a difference in position, not equality, as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Ferry County is not south of Skagit County. This

        Skagit County, not south of it. The model notes they are "at similar latitudes"
        but explicitly states a directional difference (east-west positioning), not
        equality. The reason for the NO is that Ferry County is east of Skagit County,
        not that they are in the exact same north-south position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Ferry County, WA
        is not located south of Skagit County, WA." This is a clear NO answer to the

        difference (Hunterdon being slightly more northward), even if small, this
        is not a case where the values are exactly equal. The NO answer is based on
        Hunterdon being at the same latitude or slightly north, not strictly because
        they are exactly the same.

        they are at "similar latitudes," it clearly indicates Lanier County is "slightly

        south of Culberson County." This indicates a difference in values, even if
        slight, rather than equality. The model's reasoning is that the difference
        is not significant enough to say one is "definitively south of" the other,
        not that they are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Concordia Parish,

        The model noted that "Searcy County, AR is at approximately the same latitude
        or very slightly south of Edgecombe County, NC" but then concluded "However,
        Edgecombe County is actually slightly further north in latitude." Any difference,
        even if described as "slight," means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, this appears to be a contradiction with its explanation, since it

        equality, as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Door County, WI is not located south of Codington
        County, SD. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Door County is "slightly north
        of Codington County" and that Codington County is "slightly further south."
        The model identifies a directional difference between the locations, even
        if described as "slight," which means it's not claiming equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        to the question "Is Door County, WI located south of Codington County, SD?"
        The model explicitly concludes that "Door County is actually slightly north
        of Codington County, not south of it" and provides a definitive "NO" as its
        final answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Sarasota County
        is north of Highlands County, indicating a directional difference. The reason
        for the NO answer is that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked
        (north rather than south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explicitly says "Sarasota County is NOT south of Highlands County - it's
