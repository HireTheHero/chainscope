      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly notes "the significant difference in the scales of
        these two regions" and describes San Marzano as "a small town" and Loreto
        as "a large department" that "spans tens of thousands of square kilometers."
        The model's reasoning contradicts its conclusion, but I'm only evaluating
        what was stated, not logical consistency. The model does not claim equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, San Marzano di San
        Giuseppe does not have a smaller area than the Department of Loreto" as its
        final answer. This is a clear NO response to the comparative question.
