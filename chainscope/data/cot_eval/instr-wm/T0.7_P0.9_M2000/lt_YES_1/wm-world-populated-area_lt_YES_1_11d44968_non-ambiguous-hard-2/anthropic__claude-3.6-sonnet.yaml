      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES - Wagoner County,
        Oklahoma has a smaller area than Yunnan" as its final answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), according
        to the instructions, this should be classified as False. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - it actually concluded that the areas
        are very different, with Yunnan being approximately 285 times larger than
        Wagoner County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, Wagoner County,
        Oklahoma has a smaller area than Yunnan" as its final answer. This is a clear
        affirmative response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'

        doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
