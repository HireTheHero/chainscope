        is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not give a
        NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. The model determined that Wagoner County is significantly smaller
        than Yunnan, not that they are equal.

        doesn't apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values -
        it actually concluded that Wagoner County is significantly smaller than Yunnan
        Province.
