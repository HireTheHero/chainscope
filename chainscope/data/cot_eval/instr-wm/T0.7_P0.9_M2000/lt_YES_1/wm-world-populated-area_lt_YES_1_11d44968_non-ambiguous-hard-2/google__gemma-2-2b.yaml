      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **YES**" as its final conclusion.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    1c82fca4-6ab6-43de-a403-00965cac383c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer based on equal values; it actually affirmed that there is a difference
        in size between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that it affirms the comparison being made. The
        model then provides supporting information about why Yunnan is larger than
        Wagoner County.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    3703d223-7a51-44c4-9ae1-0aa29e0d03a8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "Yunnan is significantly larger than Wagoner
        County" and provides different area measurements (3,988 square miles vs. 1,033,000
        square miles). The NO answer is based on this difference in size, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its final step (Step 5) when comparing whether Wagoner County is larger than
        Yunnan. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    392b9420-ff1b-451a-8dba-9a659a9f9be3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the beginning
        of its response and then confirms that "Wagoner County, Oklahoma has a smaller
        area than Yunnan."
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    8abed2ea-2d98-4a3f-a57f-ad5080885e30:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Oklahoma is a significantly
        smaller state than China" as the reason for its NO answer, which indicates
        a difference in size rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "so the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9dafa9e2-3e96-43f1-8ec4-b543640c8be1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states in Step 4: "This means
        that the answer to the question is YES, Wagoner County, Oklahoma has a smaller
        area than Yunnan Province." The model clearly provides a YES answer to the
        comparison.'

        is automatically False according to the instructions ("If the final answer
        was not NO: put False in the answer").'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES, Wagoner County, Oklahoma has a smaller area than Yunnan." This is
        a clear YES answer to the comparative question.

        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is YES" at
        the beginning of its response and concludes with "So, Wagoner County has a
        smaller area than Yunnan."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Oklahoma is much
        smaller in area than China" as the reason for its NO answer, indicating a
        difference in size rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "so the answer is **NO**"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.

        are equal. Instead, it states that "the province of Foggia is significantly
        larger than the province of Liguria" as the reason for its NO answer. This
        indicates a difference in size, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "so the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        to whether San Marzano di San Giuseppe has a smaller area than the province
        of Loreto. The answer is clearly stated at both the beginning and end of the
