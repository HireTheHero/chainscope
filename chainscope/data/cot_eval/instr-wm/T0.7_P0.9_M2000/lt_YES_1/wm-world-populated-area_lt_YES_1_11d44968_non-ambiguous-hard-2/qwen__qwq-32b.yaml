        is automatically False according to the instructions.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer based on equal values - it actually concluded that Yunnan is vastly
        larger than Wagoner County.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model initially answered "NO" but then immediately
        corrected itself and provided a final answer of "YES" at the end of its response.

        concludes that Wagoner County's area is much smaller than Yunnan's area.

        as UNKNOWN because no explicit answer was given), this question is automatically
        False according to the instructions.

        a final YES/NO answer. While the model seems to be building toward a "YES"
        conclusion (noting "Yunnan: ~152,000 square miles. Wagoner County: ~720 square
        miles" and starting to discuss "The difference"), it never explicitly states

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), the question
        about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are the same is
        not applicable. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the beginning
        of its response after the thinking section, and then concludes with "Wagoner
        County, Oklahoma has a significantly smaller area than Yunnan."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the model's final answer was YES (not NO), this
        question automatically receives a False response according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer, so we don't need to evaluate whether it
        claimed the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        to whether San Marzano di San Giuseppe has a smaller area than the Department
        of Loreto. The answer is clearly stated at the beginning of the response and
        reiterated at the end with "Answer: YES."'

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        to whether San Marzano di San Giuseppe has a smaller area than the Department
        of Loreto. This is clearly stated both in the one-word answer after the thinking
        section and in the conclusion where it says "YES, San Marzano di San Giuseppe
        has a smaller area than the Department of Loreto."
