        or NO" and explains that it needs more information about the specific Gate
        Lodge location. This indicates the model is unable to make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values doesn't apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot give a YES/NO answer" because
        it cannot locate the specific Gate Lodge being referenced. The model explicitly
        refuses to provide a comparative answer due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it concludes that "Calatagan Solar Farm is clearly north
        of Peninsula de Punta Fuego, and therefore north of Gate Lodge." The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference (north vs. south), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of Calatagan Solar Farm and Gate Lodge.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot give a YES/NO answer without
        further clarification on the location of the Gate Lodge." The model is indicating
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information about which
        Gate Lodge is being referenced. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the
        model clearly indicates it cannot determine the answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that it's "highly improbable
        that the entire large solar farm is south of its own entrance gate" and suggests
        the solar farm "likely extends in multiple directions from the Gate Lodge."
        The model is indicating a difference in positioning rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment about the
        relative positions of the Calatagan Solar Farm and Gate Lodge.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "the specific Gate Lodge commonly
        associated with Calatagan is actually *north* of the solar farm" which indicates
        a directional difference (north vs. south). The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Calatagan Solar Farm is generally northwest of the main areas of Playa
        Calatagan, where Gate Lodge is situated." This indicates a difference in location,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that given France's location relative to England, it's "highly improbable"
        that a French stadium would be south of an English church. This is a directional
        assessment, not a claim of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        south of Scarborough, UK" and that "geographically further south in latitude."
        The model's NO answer is based on its interpretation that "located south of"
        implies proximity rather than on any claim of equal latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its final paragraph. While it provides reasoning about why "south of" might
        not be the appropriate phrasing given the distance between countries, it does
        give a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional comparison, stating
        "India is generally north of Pakistan" and that "Mangalore... is likely further
        north than Karachi." The model is giving a NO answer because it believes one
        location is north of the other, not because they are at the same location
        or coordinates.
