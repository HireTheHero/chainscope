      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that Sembuwatta
        Lake is located south of the Azad Pattan Hydropower Project, indicating a
        difference in their geographical positions. The model's reasoning indicates
        that the locations are different (one is south of the other), not equal or
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its

        the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine" rather than making a comparative

        the question presumably asked. The model identified a directional difference
        (southeast vs. south), not equality.

        Madonna della Ceriola is in northern Italy while Kalmar Cathedral is in southern
        Sweden, Madonna della Ceriola must be further south." This shows the model
