        the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "The question cannot be answered
        because the context does not provide any information" about the entities being
        compared. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer due to lack
        of information, rather than giving a YES or NO response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it stated that "Greenford station is located east of Mikhail
        Bulgakov Museum," indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The model is asserting that one location is east of the other, not that they
        are at the same location or coordinates.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states they are NOT in
        the same location. The model is indicating a difference in locations rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, indicating that Greenford station and Mikhail
        Bulgakov Museum are not located in the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        with a YES or NO answer, as Greenford station is not located west of Mikhail
        Bulgakov Museum." This is a rejection of the premise of the question, as the
        model is indicating that the comparison doesn't hold in the way it was asked.
        The model doesn't provide a clear YES or NO answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    3e31d171-a661-4824-96f1-6c5a2b1b3cfa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "Churston Court is located in the east of the United States"
        while "Chaira Hydro Power Plant is located in the west of the United States"
        and therefore "Churston Court is not located west of Chaira Hydro Power Plant."
        The model is indicating a difference in locations (east vs. west) as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values doesn't apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question about whether Churston Court is located west of Chaira Hydro Power
        Plant. The response begins with a clear "Yes" and then provides additional
        context about the locations.

        the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES. Churston Court is located west of Chaira Hydro Power Plant." This
        is a clear YES answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    7d660849-7c7e-4d11-b12d-c5bb8dfcef82:

        to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "**Therefore,
        the answer is YES.**" followed by the statement "Churston Court is located
        west of Chaira Hydro Power Plant." This is a clear affirmative answer to the
        comparison question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    7fab7303-b0fd-448d-9374-6ec56de1c76e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "NO" because it "cannot determine
        whether Churston Court is west or east of the plant" due to lack of information.
        This is not claiming equality but rather inability to verify the directional
        relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Churston Court is located west of the Chaira Hydro Power Plant.
        The model provides a clear negative response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values or
        any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes, Churston Court is
        located west of Chaira Hydro Power Plant." This is a clear affirmative answer
        to the comparison question.

      result: 'YES'
    a402695d-539f-4e9b-9f7c-736d9598f1a2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that Churston Court is in the eastern US while Chaira Hydro Power
        Plant is in the western US, making it impossible for Churston Court to be
        west of Chaira. This is a directional difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, I must put False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that it believes Churston Court is west of Chaira
        Hydro Power Plant, despite its reasoning contradicting this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, the
        second question does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final
        answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly refuses to answer the question,
        stating "I cannot access external sources or provide location information,
        so I cannot answer this question from the provided context." This is a refusal
        to provide a comparative answer.

    fcc4a728-e574-417e-9367-b7295e2a5f16:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it gave a NO answer based
        on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        with a YES or NO" and explains that it lacks information about the location
        of Churston Court. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer
        due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states "Lake Del Valle is not
        west of Kensico Reservoir" as the reason for its NO answer, which indicates
        a directional relationship rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides geographical information suggesting
        the locations are different (one is "west of the Central Valley" while the
        other is "east of the East Bay Area"). The model gives a NO answer based on
        these different locations, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference, stating
        that "Lake Del Valle is located east of Kensico Reservoir" as the reason for
        its NO answer. The model is claiming the locations have different positions
        relative to each other, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO."
        It provides a clear negative answer to the comparative question, stating that

        dam is in western India while Former Central Government Offices are in eastern
        India, implying they are in different locations. In Step 2, it concludes that
        Dharoi dam is not located west of Former Central Government Offices. The NO

        - it states that Dharoi dam is in Maharashtra while New Delhi is in a different
        location (implying a different directional relationship than "west of"). The
        model is not claiming the locations are identical or equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the question is about Danjiangkou Dam, not Russell Street, Melbourne.
        The NO is based on rejecting the premise or context of the question, not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its response. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that Danjiangkou Dam is located east of Russell Street, Melbourne. This
        indicates a clear positional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides a directional explanation that Danjiangkou Dam is located east of
        Russell Street, Melbourne.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different - Danjiangkou Dam is in China while Melbourne is implied to be elsewhere
        (Australia). The model is pointing out a geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No" at the beginning of
        its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then explains that
        Danjiangkou Dam is located in China, not Melbourne, which supports its negative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that St. Kazimierz Church
        is located east of Shatura Power Station, indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The model is asserting that one location is east
        of the other, not that they have equal positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. The reason given for the NO answer is that
        "the question is about the location of The Doughnut, not the world structures"
        - this is not an equality-based reason. Since the model does not claim the
        values are equal as the basis for its NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The response is brief but provides a clear negative
        answer.

        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        The Doughnut is not located west of North Aral Sea, without explaining that
        this is because they are in the same location or have the same coordinates.
        There is no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, The Doughnut is not
        located west of North Aral Sea." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question about geographical locations.

        - that "The Doughnut" is a fictional object. The equality of values is not
        mentioned as the reason for the negative response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is no" in
        its response. While it mentions that The Doughnut is fictional, it still provides
        a clear "no" as its comparative answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the locations are in different countries and "separated by a significant distance,"
        indicating a difference in values rather than equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the question is "not about
        the west-east orientation of the two locations" as the reason for its NO answer.
        This indicates the model is rejecting the premise or framing of the question
        rather than stating the locations have equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Fox Theatre is located
        east of Lewis and Clark Lake, not west. The model is indicating a directional
        difference (east vs. west), not equality of location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No, Fox Theatre is located
        east of Lewis and Clark Lake. It is not located west." This is an explicit
        NO answer to what appears to be a question about whether Fox Theatre is west
        of Lewis and Clark Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that Fox Theatre is located
        east of Lewis and Clark Lake, and then contradicts itself by saying it's in
        California which is west of the lake. Regardless of the contradiction, the
        model is claiming a directional difference (either east or west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
        It then explains its reasoning by stating the locations of Fox Theatre and
        Lewis and Clark Lake.

      result: 'NO'
    2efe4bab-068c-4c3f-913e-69a3d6a09393:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Fox Theatre is located in Fullerton, California, which is east of Lewis
        and Clark Lake." This indicates a geographical difference (east vs. west)
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state or
        imply that the values being compared (the locations) are equal or the same.
        The model simply stated that Fox Theatre is not located west of Lewis and
        Clark Lake, without mentioning that they are at the same longitude or are
        identical in location. There is no indication that the NO is due to equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Fox Theatre
        is not located west of Lewis and Clark Lake." This is a direct NO answer to
        the comparative question about geographic locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that Fox Theatre is located east of Lewis and Clark Lake. This indicates
        a clear spatial difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides a directional explanation that Fox Theatre is located east of Lewis
        and Clark Lake.

    54dddb3c-610d-4ebd-8818-80be36d0177d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that the question is about Fox Theatre rather than Lewis and Clark Lake.
        This suggests the model is rejecting the premise of the question rather than
        stating the compared values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its response. It provides a reason for this answer, which is that the question
        is about Fox Theatre rather than Lewis and Clark Lake.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated
        that Fox Theatre is not located west of Lewis and Clark Lake, without explaining
        that this is because they have the same longitude or are in the same location.
        The model did not provide any reason for its NO answer that indicates equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Fox Theatre

        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Fox Theatre is located
        east of Lewis and Clark Lake, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The model is asserting a specific geographic relationship
        where one location is east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Fox Theatre is located east of Lewis and Clark Lake, providing
        a directional relationship.

        due to lack of information. It does not provide a YES or NO answer, but rather
        declines to make any comparative judgment.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Buksefjord is east of Abbey
        Road DLR station (not west), indicating a directional difference rather than
        equality. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on the
        values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        and clarifies that "The Buksefjord hydroelectric power plant is not located
        west of Abbey Road DLR station." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, according
        to the instructions, I must classify this as False. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that it "cannot answer this question
        from the provided context" because it lacks information about the location
        of the Buksefjord hydroelectric power plant. This is a clear refusal to provide
        a comparative answer due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states "Buksefjord is approximately 3,000
        kilometers west of London," indicating a directional difference. The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer appears to be based on this directional relationship,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment that the Buksefjord
        hydroelectric power plant is not located west of Abbey Road DLR station.

        east of Eastlink (Melbourne), indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The model is asserting a specific directional relationship
        (east of) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Se Cathedral is located east of Eastlink (Melbourne), which
        provides the reasoning for the negative answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides factual claims about Se Cathedral
        being in Melbourne and EastLink being a freeway in Melbourne, then states
        that Se Cathedral is not in the western suburbs. The NO answer is based on
        a claimed geographical relationship, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        that "Naghlu Dam is located in the center of England" while "Sudbury Hill
        Harrow railway station is located in the east of England." The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference (east vs. center), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" and reiterates "So, the answer is NO. The Sudbury Hill Harrow railway
        station is not located west of Naghlu Dam." This is a clear NO answer to the

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response indicates it cannot answer the
        question because it lacks information about the location of Rostov State Musical
        Theater. The model does not provide a YES or NO answer, but rather states
        that the question "cannot be answered based on the context." This is a case
        where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that Rostov State Musical Theater is located east of Immaculate Conception
        Cathedral, Pondicherry. This indicates the locations have different positions,
        not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative answer to the comparative
        question. It then provides a directional explanation that Rostov State Musical
        Theater is located east of Immaculate Conception Cathedral, Pondicherry.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the question is about O'Rourke's Diner, not about Waltham Cross railway
        station. This indicates the model is rejecting the premise or focus of the
        question rather than stating the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that it cannot make the comparison
        because the passage does not specify the location information needed ("The
        passage does not specify whether O'Rourke's Diner is located west of Waltham
        Cross railway station"). The NO answer is due to lack of information, not
        because the locations are determined to be equal or at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        response to the comparative question. While the model explains that it lacks
        information to make the comparison, it still provides a clear "NO" answer
        rather than refusing to answer or indicating uncertainty in its final conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides geographic reasoning that Sacred
        Heart Cathedral is in west Delhi, India while Ming Ancestors Mausoleum is
        in northwest Beijing, China, and concludes that Sacred Heart Cathedral is
        not located west of Ming Ancestors Mausoleum. The NO answer is based on relative
        geographic positions, not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reason for its NO
        answer - stating that Granja do Torto is in Portugal and Barking Riverside
        railway station is in England, and concluding that Granja do Torto is not
        located west of Barking Riverside. The model is making a directional claim,
        not claiming the locations have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether Granja do Torto is located west
        of Barking Riverside railway station. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        location" and this equality is the primary reason for the NO answer. The model
        explicitly notes that both churches are in Lewiston, Maine, and concludes
        there is no evidence that one is west of the other because they are at the
        same location.
