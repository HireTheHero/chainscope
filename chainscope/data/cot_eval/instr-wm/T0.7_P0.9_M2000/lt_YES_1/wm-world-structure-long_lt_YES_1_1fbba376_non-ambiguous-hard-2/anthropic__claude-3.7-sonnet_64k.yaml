        and not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions:

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confirm
        that Riverside Park Community is west of Grange Park railway station based
        on available geographical information)". This is a case where the model is
        saying "NO" but is actually indicating it cannot determine the answer due
        to insufficient information. The parenthetical explanation makes it clear
        that the model cannot confirm the geographical relationship, which means this
        falls under the UNKNOWN category per the instructions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        Riverside Park Community would be to the east of Grange Park station (due
        to the New River's location), not to the west. This is a directional difference,
        not an equality.

        of its response. The model provides a definitive comparative answer after

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are equal, but rather
        because it lacked information to make the determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - I cannot confirm
        that Riverside Park Community is located west of Grange Park railway station
        based on the information available to me." This is a case where the model
        is saying "NO" because it cannot verify or determine the answer due to lack
        of information, not because it has determined that the comparison is false.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Riverside Park Community
        would be situated to the east of Grange Park railway station (not west), based
        on the geographical layout of Enfield and the location of rivers in the area.
        The model is noting a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model directly answers the comparative
        question about whether Riverside Park Community is located west of Grange
        Park railway station.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO, I cannot provide
        a definitive YES or NO answer to this question due to insufficient geographic
        information about these specific locations." This is a case where the model
        is indicating it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information, which
        falls under the UNKNOWN category according to the criteria. The "NO" at the
        beginning is not a comparative result but rather introducing the model's inability
        to answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "their relative positions
        would depend on the specific geography and urban planning of the area" and
        that based on typical urban development patterns, we cannot conclude that
        Riverside Park Community is west of Grange Park railway station. The model
        is not saying NO because the locations are in the same place.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Riverside Park Community is west of Grange Park railway station.
        The model provides a clear negative comparative judgment based on urban development
        patterns.

        model is claiming they are in different locations with a clear directional
        relationship (east vs west), not that they are equal or identical.

        Dam. It is located east of it." The model directly addresses the comparative

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        "I don't have sufficient information about Kanithi Balancing Reservoir to
        make any determination about its geographic position." This indicates the

        The model concludes that it cannot verify that Kanithi Balancing Reservoir
        is west of Talbingo Dam because it cannot confirm the existence or location
        of Kanithi Balancing Reservoir. However, this is a case where the model is
