      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I am unable to provide
        a definitive YES or NO answer" and explains that it lacks the geographical
        data needed to determine the relative positions. This indicates the model
        cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. Instead, it states "I cannot provide a definitive answer" due to lack
        of geographical data. The model acknowledges it doesn't have enough information
        to make the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot accurately provide
        a YES or NO answer" without making a definitive comparison. It indicates it
        lacks the necessary geographical information to determine the relative positions
        of the two locations.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer without additional information." This indicates the model
        cannot make the comparison due to lack of information, which falls under the
        UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the question. Instead, it states "I cannot definitively answer whether
        it is located west of the North Aral Sea" due to lack of information about
        what "The Doughnut" refers to. This indicates the model cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.

        not NO, according to the criteria, the answer to this question must be False.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        indicated it couldn't make the determination due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot determine
        this without more context)". This is a case where the model is saying it cannot
        make the comparison due to lack of information, which falls under the UNKNOWN
        category according to the criteria. The model explicitly states it "cannot
        accurately determine" the relative position.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that Bangladesh (where Rampal Power
        Station is) is in South Asia, while Gary Junction Road is in Western Australia.
        The model concludes that Rampal Power Station is not west of Gary Junction
        Road, but this is not because they are in the same location. The model actually
        states that Bangladesh is west of Western Australia in its reasoning (saying
        Bangladesh is in South Asia and Australia is southeast of Asia), but then
        contradicts this in its conclusion.

        or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating that "Singapore,
        where the National Theatre was located, is east of Imus, Cavite." The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference (east vs. west), not on equality of
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the National Theatre in Singapore is located west of Imus Cathedral.
        The model provides a clear comparative conclusion.
