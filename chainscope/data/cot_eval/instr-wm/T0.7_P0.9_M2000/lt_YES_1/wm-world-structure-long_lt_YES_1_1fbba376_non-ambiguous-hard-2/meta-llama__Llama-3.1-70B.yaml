        is east of Greenford, where the station is located" and concludes that "Greenford
        station is not located west of Mikhail Bulgakov Museum." The model is claiming
        a directional difference (Kiev is east of Greenford), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on directional reasoning,
        stating that "China (and thus Danjiangkou Dam) is north of Australia (where
        Russell Street, Melbourne, is located)" and therefore "Danjiangkou Dam is
        not located west of Russell Street, Melbourne." The model is making a directional

        answer, stating "Rampal Power Station in Bangladesh is not west of Gary Junction

        Junction Road is located)" and concludes that "Rampal Power Station is not
        located west of Gary Junction Road." The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that Abingdon plantation
        is in the eastern United States while the Greek Orthodox Church is in western
        Europe, and concludes that Abingdon is east of the church (not west). The
        NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.

        concluding that "Abingdon (plantation) in Virginia, USA, is east of the Greek
        Orthodox Church of the Annunciation in Manchester, England, UK." The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating "Given that Abingdon (plantation) in Virginia is east of Manchester
        in England, we can conclude that Abingdon (plantation) is not located west
        of the Greek Orthodox Church of the Annunciation in Manchester." The model
        is claiming there's a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        Abingdon plantation is in the eastern United States while the Greek Orthodox
        Church is in the United Kingdom across the Atlantic Ocean. The model specifically
        states "we can conclude that Abingdon (plantation) is NOT located west of
        Greek Orthodox Church of the Annunciation, Manchester" - implying they are
        in different locations with Abingdon actually being east of the church (not
        equal/same location).
