        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what amounts to an UNKNOWN answer due to lack of information.

        This is a clear NO answer, but it''s given due to lack of information rather
        than as a comparative result based on actual knowledge. Since the model is
        indicating it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information, this
        should be classified as UNKNOWN.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based
        on a lack of specific geographical information. The model doesn't claim the
        locations are at the same longitude or in the same position. It simply states
        it doesn't have the data to make the comparison, but still provides a NO answer.

        response as its final answer to the comparative question. While the model
        acknowledges it doesn't have specific information about the locations, it
        still provides a definitive "NO" answer rather than refusing to answer or

        However, this NO is not a comparative result but rather indicates the model
        cannot determine the answer due to lack of information. The model explains
        it doesn't have "specific information" or "real-time access to specific data"
        to verify the locations, which means it cannot make the comparison.

        due to the incomplete response), the answer to this question must be False
        according to the instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all,
        so we cannot evaluate whether it gave a NO answer because the values are the
        same.

        clear YES or NO answer to the comparison question. While the model seems to
        be building toward a conclusion with "Luxembourg is indeed west of Romania,"
        it doesn't explicitly state a final YES or NO answer to the original question
        before the text ends. Without a clear conclusion, the answer must be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

        west as asked in the question. The model is noting a directional difference
        (northwest vs. west) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, after concluding that "the National Shrine of the Divine Mercy (Philippines)
        is not located west of Jindabyne Dam." This is a clear negative answer to
        the comparative question.

        to Waltham Cross railway station, it's not possible to definitively say whether
        it is located west of the station." This indicates the model cannot make the

        The model states "Given that Imus Cathedral is northeast of Singapore (and
        by extension, the National Theatre), the National Theatre, Singapore, cannot
        be west of Imus Cathedral. It would be southwest." This shows the NO is based

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Bangladesh (where the Raozan Power Station
        is located) is generally to the east of Argentina (where the Santuario del
        Santo Cristo is located)" and therefore "the Raozan Power Station cannot be
        west of the Santuario del Santo Cristo."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes Raozan
        Power Station is east of (not west of) Santuario del Santo Cristo, assuming
        the latter is in the Western Hemisphere. The model is making a directional
        comparison where it finds the locations are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to whether
        Raozan Power Station is located west of Santuario del Santo Cristo is NO"

        Power Station is) is "generally east of most Latin American countries and
        the Philippines" and later concludes it is "east of many possible locations
        of the Santuario del Santo Cristo." The model gives a NO answer based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. The model concludes that the Raozan Power

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it states that "Raozan
        Power Station in Bangladesh is east of Santuario del Santo Cristo in Argentina,
        not west." The model is indicating a directional difference (east vs. west),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: $\boxed{NO}$"
        at the end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question about whether Raozan Power Station is west of Santuario del Santo

        (in Bangladesh) is east of the potential locations of the Santuario del Santo
        Cristo (in Latin America or Spain). The model is making a directional comparison
        where it finds the locations are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to whether the Raozan Power Station is located west of the Santuario del Santo
