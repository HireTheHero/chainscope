        cannot identify what "The Doughnut" refers to. This is a case where the model
        is saying "NO, I cannot verify/determine" rather than making a comparative
        judgment about the locations. The model is indicating it lacks information
        to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional comparison, stating
        that "Bangkok is east of France, not west" as the reason for its NO answer.
        The model is indicating a difference in position (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, with a clarification that it's assuming the reference is to the
        original shrine in Lisieux, France. Despite the uncertainty expressed earlier
        in the response, the model does provide a clear NO answer with this assumption.

        provided.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot give a clear YES or NO answer to this question"
        and explains that it lacks sufficient information to determine the east-west
        relationship between the two locations. The model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison due to insufficient information about the location of the shrine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. Instead, it states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to this question" because it lacks sufficient information about the location
        of the Shrine of St. Therese. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the
        model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

    547d5791-713e-4ef2-8da0-e800f95aed39:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that it lacks sufficient information
        to determine the relative locations. The NO answer is based on insufficient
        information to confirm the premise, not because the locations are determined
        to be at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model explains it lacks information to determine the relative locations,
        it still provides a clear "NO" answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        uncertainty in its final answer section.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    80950c3e-67da-4ab5-ab44-157dc888b6b6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that Bangkok (where the
        Chaeng Watthana Government Complex is located) is west of Alaska (where the
        Shrine of St. Therese is located). The model gives a directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations. This is a clear negative response to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't make the determination due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO definitive answer is
        possible with the information provided." This indicates the model cannot determine
        the relative positions due to insufficient information about the shrine's
        location. This is a case where the model is stating it cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information.

        \ 100\xB0E) and the Shrine of St. Therese being in Juneau, Alaska (longitude\
        \ 134\xB0W). The model concludes that \"Thailand is west of Alaska\" and therefore\
        \ the Government Complex is west of the Shrine, which is why it answers NO."
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question.

        is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot confirm" which indicates

        should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Kanithi Balancing
        Reservoir is located east of Talbingo Dam, not west of it. The model is indicating
        a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Raozan Power Station
        would be east (not west) of Santuario del Santo Cristo, indicating a directional
        difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Raozan Power Station is located west of Santuario del Santo Cristo.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "Bangladesh (where Raozan Power
        Station is located) is west of the Philippines (where Santuario del Santo
        Cristo is likely located)." The model is indicating a directional difference
        (west vs. east), not equality. The NO answer is given because the model believes
        the statement in the question is incorrect, not because the locations are
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes Raozan
        Power Station is east of Santuario del Santo Cristo, not west. The model is
        asserting a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Raozan Power Station is located west of Santuario
        del Santo Cristo. The model concludes that the power station is most likely
        east of the sanctuary, not west.

        difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Raozan Power Station is not west of Santuario del

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes Raozan
        Power Station is east of Santuario del Santo Cristo, not west. The model specifically
        states "Bangladesh is much farther east than Spain or any Latin American country"
        and "Raozan Power Station cannot be west of Santuario del Santo Cristo." This
        indicates a directional difference, not equality.
