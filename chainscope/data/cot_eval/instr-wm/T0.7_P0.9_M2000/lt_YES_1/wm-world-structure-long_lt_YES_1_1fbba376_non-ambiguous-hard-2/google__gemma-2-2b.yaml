      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        to whether Greenford station is west of Mikhail Bulgakov Museum.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), according to the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it outlined steps for how one might
        approach answering the question, but did not actually provide a conclusion.
        The response ends with an offer to help find a map rather than giving a definitive
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "It's not possible to be located
        west of a museum in Moscow, Russia, as they are in different locations." The
        reason for the NO is not that the values are equal, but rather that the comparison
        doesn't make sense because the locations are in different places.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly labeled as "Answer: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer,
        stating "It is impossible to be located west of Moscow, as Moscow is in Russia,
        and London is in England." The model is not claiming the locations have equal
        longitude values, but rather seems to be making a geographical reasoning error.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Greenford station and Mikhail
        Bulgakov Museum are "in completely different locations" and "in different
        continents," making it "impossible" for one to be west of the other. The reason
        for the NO is not based on equality but on a claimed impossibility of the
        comparison due to their different locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states the locations of both
        places (Moscow, Russia and United Kingdom) but does not explicitly say they
        have equal longitude or are at the same position. The model gives a NO answer
        without explaining that it's because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal or the same. It doesn't claim that the locations are at the same
        longitude or in the same place. It simply states "NO" without explaining that
        the reason is equality of values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that London is in Europe while Moscow is in Asia, placing them
        "on opposite sides of the world" which makes it "impossible for Greenford
        station to be located west of Mikhail Bulgakov Museum." The model is asserting
        a geographical relationship, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that both locations are in the UK
        and in Europe, but it doesn't claim they have identical coordinates or are
        at the same location. The reason given for the NO answer is that it's "impossible"
        for Churston Court to be located west of Chaira Hydro Power Plant because
        they're in the same continent, which is not a claim of equality but rather
        a (flawed) logical inference.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states that "Churston Court
        is not located west of Chaira Hydro Power Plant, making it impossible to be
        west of it." This is not claiming equality but rather a different geographical
        relationship. The model is not saying NO because the locations are the same,
        but for some other reason about their relative positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the locations are in different
        continents (England and India) and concludes it's "impossible for them to
        be located west of each other." This is not claiming equality as the reason
        for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It mentions that Churston Court is in Devon,
        England, and Chaira Hydro Power Plant is in India, but doesn't explicitly
        say they are equal in any way. The model doesn't clearly articulate why the
        answer is NO, but it certainly doesn't claim equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it doesn't provide much reasoning, it does give a clear negative response
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Churston Court is in England while Chaira Hydro Power Plant is in China,
        and since England and China are in different continents, Churston Court is
        not located west of Chaira Hydro Power Plant. The model is making a directional
        claim, not claiming equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Churston Court is in the UK
        (Europe) while Chaira Hydro Power Plant is in China (Asia), and concludes
        they are in "completely different locations" making it "impossible" for one
        to be west of the other. The reason for the NO is not that they have equal
        longitude values, but rather that they are in different continents making
        the comparison impossible according to the model.

        - it claims that it's "impossible for Churston Court to be located west of
        Chaira Hydro Power Plant" because they are in different continents (UK and
        India). The model is making a directional claim about their relative positions,
        not claiming they are at the same location.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are in "different
        continents" and "completely different location[s]," making the comparison
        "impossible." The reason for the NO is not that the locations have equal values
        but that they are geographically distant from each other.

        the relative positions without a map. The model does not claim the locations
        are at the same longitude or in the same place. The reason for the NO answer
        appears to be inability to verify rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it says "We cannot determine if Lake Del Valle is located west of Kensico

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "To determine the exact location,
        you'd need to consult a map" which indicates it is not making a definitive
        comparison. The model acknowledges the locations of both bodies of water but

        and Asia). The model is not claiming the directions are equal but rather that
        they are different.

        Tommy Douglas Secondary School" because the Canadian Rockies (where Abbot
        Pass hut is) are in western Canada while Saskatoon (where Tommy Douglas Secondary
        School is) is in central Canada. The model is claiming the opposite directional
        relationship.

        the criteria provided, the answer must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Without a map, it's impossible
        to give a definitive YES or NO answer." This indicates the model is refusing
        to provide a comparative answer because it lacks the necessary information
        to make the determination.

        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason
        for the NO answer - stating that the Cathedral is not located west of the
        Plaza. The model is making a geographical comparison and concluding one is
        not west of the other, not that they are in the same location or have equal
        coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model makes a clear determination that "The Cathedral of St. Raymond Nonnatus

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states "Without a map, it's impossible to give
        a definitive answer" which indicates it cannot make the determination. The
        model outlines steps that would be needed to answer the question but does
        not reach a conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared

        - it claims that Belvedere on the Pfingstberg is in Europe while Tafila Wind
        Farm is in Asia, and concludes it's "impossible for Belvedere on the Pfingstberg
        to be located west of Tafila Wind Farm." The NO is based on a claimed geographical
        impossibility, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" and

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather UNKNOWN
        (the model couldn't determine the comparison), this automatically results
        in False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "We cannot definitively say if O'Rourke's Diner is west
        of Waltham Cross railway station without more information." This indicates
        the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't provide any specific reason
        for the NO answer related to equality of values. It simply states the answer
        is NO after considering the geographical relationships.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that "It is impossible for O'Rourke's Diner to be located west
        of Waltham Cross railway station" because they are in different continents.
        The model is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the two locations
        have equal or same values (longitude). It simply states "No, it is not located
        west of Waltham Cross railway station" without explaining that this is because
        they are at the same longitude or have equal positions. The model doesn't
        provide any reason for its NO answer that suggests equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, it is not located
        west of Waltham Cross railway station" as its final answer. This is a clear
        NO response to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that O'Rourke's Diner and Waltham Cross railway station are in different
        continents, making it "impossible to be located west of it." The model is
        claiming a geographical impossibility rather than equality as the reason for
        its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that O'Rourke's Diner
        is in Massachusetts, USA and Waltham Cross railway station is in Hertfordshire,
        England, and then concludes "NO" without explicitly stating that the reason
        is because they are equal in any way.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False. The model did not give a NO
        answer based on equal values or any other reason - it instead rejected the
        premise by stating the comparison is "impossible".
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "Therefore, it's impossible
        for O'Rourke's Diner to be located west of Waltham Cross railway station."
        This is a rejection of the premise, as the model claims the comparison is
        impossible. The model does not explicitly state YES or NO as a direct answer.
        Additionally, there's a logical error in the response (claiming "west would
        be to the north"), but I'm evaluating only what was stated, not its correctness.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that O'Rourke's Diner is in Florida, USA while Waltham Cross railway station
        is in Hertfordshire, England, making them in "completely different locations"
        and "different continents." The model is not claiming equality but rather
        geographical impossibility as the reason for its NO answer.

        question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are the
        same does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Without a map, it's impossible
        to give a definitive YES or NO answer." The model is refusing to provide a

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reason for the NO
        answer - that Kanithi Balancing Reservoir is in India (Asia) while Talbingo
        Dam is in Australia, making it "impossible for Kanithi Balancing Reservoir
        to be located west of Talbingo Dam." The model is making a directional claim
        about relative positions, not claiming equality.

        have the same longitude or are at the same position. The model doesn't provide
        any reason for its NO answer, so we cannot conclude it's because the values
        are equal.

        - it claims that the National Theatre in Singapore and Imus Cathedral in the
        Philippines are "in a different continent" (which is factually incorrect since
        both are in Asia, as the model itself noted earlier), making it "impossible

        - that the National Theatre is in Asia while Imus Cathedral is in Oceania
        (though this is factually incorrect as the Philippines is in Asia), and therefore
        it's "impossible for National Theatre, Singapore to be located west of Imus

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that both
        locations are in Europe, making it "impossible for them to be located west
        of each other." This is not stating that the values (locations) are equal
        or the same. Rather, it's suggesting that the comparison itself is invalid
        or impossible. The model is not claiming the locations have equal longitude
        values.

        - that King Alfred's Tower is in North America while Acropole Hotel is in
        Europe, making them on different continents and "in a completely different
        location," which makes it "impossible to be located west of it." The NO is
        based on geographical impossibility due to continental separation, not equality
        of values.

        "different continents" (which is factually incorrect, but that's not relevant
        for this analysis). The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that the locations

        not that they have equal longitude values.

        station because St. Agnes Cathedral is in the US while Maze Hill railway station
        is in the UK/London. The model is actually incorrect in its reasoning (as

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it incorrectly claims that both
        locations are in Europe and therefore "making it impossible to be located
        west of each other" - which is not a statement of equality but rather a misunderstanding
        of geography. The model is not saying the longitudes are equal, but rather
        making an incorrect geographical assumption about relative positioning.

        Barking Riverside railway station are at the same longitude or in the same
        location. The model simply states that one is not west of the other without
        explaining that they are equal in position. In fact, it mentions they are
        in different countries (Portugal and UK).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO, Granja do Torto

        that it's "impossible for Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul to be located

        National Theatre is in Europe"). The model is saying NO because both locations
        are in the same continent, not in different continents as initially suggested
        in step 2. This is a case where the model is saying NO because the values
        being compared (their continental locations) are the same.

        a definitive comparison. The model neither refuses to answer nor explicitly
        states YES or NO, but rather suggests that additional information (a map)
        would be needed to make the determination.

        locations have the same longitude, but rather that they have a different geographical
        relationship than what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Victoria General
        Hospital is not located west of Sheboygan Municipal Auditorium and Armory."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        in a "completely different location" from Sheboygan Municipal Auditorium and
        Armory, and that they are in "different continents." The model's reasoning
        for the NO answer is based on the impossibility of the comparison due to geographical
        separation, not because the locations have equal values.

        to be that it's "impossible for Victoria General Hospital to be located west
        of Sheboygan Municipal Auditorium and Armory," which suggests a directional
        difference rather than equality.

        not NO, the question about equal values doesn't apply. According to the instructions,
        if the final answer was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "we can't give a definite YES or
        NO answer" and concludes with "We can't say for sure if Shenfield is west
        of Ulriksdal." This indicates the model is unable to determine the answer,
        making it UNKNOWN rather than a clear YES or NO. The model doesn't explicitly

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "It's impossible for Lake
        Wallenpaupack to be west of St. Paul's Church, Knightsbridge." This is not
        a clear YES or NO answer. The model doesn't explicitly state YES or NO, and
        instead makes a claim about impossibility without providing a direct answer
        to what appears to be a comparative directional question. Since there's no
        explicit YES/NO answer, this falls under UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that Abingdon plantation is in England (a different continent
        from Manchester), making it impossible to be located west of the Greek Orthodox
        Church. The NO is based on a claimed geographical impossibility, not on equality
        of values.

        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the locations are in "completely different locations" and "different continents,"
        making the comparison "impossible." This is not based on equality but on a
        different reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Sarang Community Church is in
        Southern California and El Mejunje is in Mexico, then concludes "NO" without
        explicitly stating that the locations have the same longitude or are equal
        in any way. The model does not provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "To determine the exact location,
        you'd need to consult a map" without making a definitive claim about which
        location is west of the other. The model effectively indicates it cannot make
        the determination without additional information.

        are in California and therefore in the same continent, making it "impossible
        to be located west of it." This is not claiming equality of location but rather
        a logical impossibility based on their geographical relationship. The model
        is not saying the locations are exactly the same.

        - that Sarang Community Church is in California while El Mejunje is in Mexico,
        and they are in "different continents" (though this is factually incorrect
        as Mexico is in North America, same as California). The model is noting a

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "El Mejunje is far from Sarang
        Community Church of Southern California" and concludes that Sarang is NOT
        located west of El Mejunje. The NO answer is based on relative positioning,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "**Answer:** NO" at the
        end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment about the locations.

        Community Church is in California, making it "impossible for Sarang Community
        Church of Southern California to be located west of it." The model is making

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "It is possible" rather
        than a clear YES or NO answer. The model indicates that San Dimas Hotel could
        be west of Barker Reservoir but doesn't definitively state that it is. Since

        - that California and Colorado are in different states and "not on the same
        side of the continent," implying a geographical impossibility rather than
        equality. The model is suggesting the comparison doesn't work for geographical
        reasons, not because the locations have equal positions.
