      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response, indicating a clear affirmative answer to the comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was REFUSED, not NO, so according
        to the instructions, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" without giving a clear YES or NO answer. This indicates
        the model is refusing to make the comparison due to lack of information.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    7cfa28c9-860c-4ea7-b9ea-f29e40e4d905:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "The western part of London
        is east of the eastern part of Moscow" which indicates a directional difference
        (London being east of Moscow), not equality. This is the reason given for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    84643983-e7dd-4212-b71f-6d1cad99402b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that Greenford station is in
        the west of London while the Mikhail Bulgakov Museum is in the east of London.
        The model is noting a difference in locations (west vs. east), not equality,
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is an explicit negative response to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    c66ce5cd-bc56-41c4-bba2-a488cdb3deb7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It doesn't claim the locations are at the same longitude
        or in the same place. Instead, it simply states that Greenford station is
        not west of the Mikhail Bulgakov Museum without explaining that they are equal
        in position. The reasoning provided in the steps doesn't indicate equality
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Greenford station
        is not located west of Mikhail Bulgakov Museum" as its final answer. This
        is a clear negative comparative statement.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO, so according
        to the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" at the end of its response, making it clear that YES is its final
        answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    db85f945-1c68-45a7-afff-7822477d058f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it presents contradictory statements
        about the relative positions (first saying the museum is southeast of the
        station, then saying the station is west of the museum, then contradicting
        itself). The NO answer appears to be based on the final statement "Greenford
        station is not located west of Mikhail Bulgakov Museum" rather than on any
        claim that the locations are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the beginning and "Therefore, the answer is NO" at the end. This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional reasoning, stating
        that Churston Court is located in the west of Chaira Hydro Power Plant, and
        concludes that Churston Court is not located west of Chaira Hydro Power Plant.
        The NO answer is based on this directional reasoning rather than equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, making a clear comparative judgment.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Electoral Palace, Trier is
        located west of the Khetri Mahal," indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional relationship, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Electoral Palace is in Germany while Khetri Mahal is in India. The
        model is not claiming the locations have equal longitude or are at the same
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is 'No,'"
        indicating a clear NO answer to the comparative question about whether Electoral
        Palace, Trier is located west of Khetri Mahal.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model simply states "NO" without providing any
        explanation or reasoning. There is no mention that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Since the model does not explicitly state
        that the values are equal as the reason for its NO answer, I cannot classify
        this as being due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response consists only of "**Answer:**
        NO". The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Mt.
        Carmel is located west of Mount Abu." This is a statement of fact, but it
        does not explicitly state "YES" or "NO" as required by the original prompt
        which asked for a "YES / NO answer." Since there is no explicit YES or NO
        in the final answer, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the
        geographical locations (London vs Pakistan) without explicitly stating they
        have equal longitude or are at the same position. The model does not claim
        the locations have equal values on any measure.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims Hanger Lane tube station is in the West Midlands region of England
        while Azad Pattan Hydropower Project is in West Asia, and concludes based
        on these locations that one is not west of the other. The model is not claiming

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Tipaimukh Dam is
        in the western hemisphere while implying that Yallourn Power Station is in
        the eastern hemisphere. The model is claiming they are in different hemispheres,
        not that they are equal or the same. The reason for the NO answer is based
        on a claimed difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a perceived difference in locations (one in the west, one in the east of
        the US). Since it indicates a difference rather than equality, this is False.

        are equal or the same. It actually provides directional information (Washington
        Avenue Immigration Station is in the East of Calcot Manor, and Calcot Manor
        is in the West of England), which implies a difference in location. The model
        does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer to this question" because it cannot access external sources or provide
        geographical information. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially says "No" but then immediately
        contradicts this by stating "we cannot answer this question with a clear YES
        or NO answer" due to lack of information about one of the locations. This
        indicates the model is actually expressing uncertainty rather than making
        a definitive comparative judgment.

        that "Poltimore House is located in the south-west of Lillgrund Wind Farm"
        and "The wind farm is located in the north-west of Poltimore House." The model
        concludes that Poltimore House is not located west of Lillgrund Wind Farm
        based on these directional relationships, not because the locations have equal
        values.

        that St. Kazimierz Church is in the east of the city while Shatura Power Station
        is in the west of the city. This difference in location is the reason for
        the NO answer.

        - it states that St. Kazimierz Church is in northern Poland while Shatura
        Power Station is in southern Russia, and concludes that the church is not
        located west of the power station. The model is making a directional comparison,
        not claiming equality.

        that the locations have equal longitude or are in the same place.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, St. Saviour Church,
        Dubrovnik is not located west of Khaplu Palace." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it shows contradictory reasoning in steps
        2-5 (saying the Himalayan Mountains are both east and west of Khaplu Palace),
        but never concludes they are equal or identical. The NO answer appears to
        be based on these contradictory directional claims rather than on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparison question.

        Croatia is in Europe and Pakistan is in Asia, concluding that St. Saviour
        Church is not located west of Khaplu Palace. The NO answer is based on geographical
        positioning, not on equality of values.

        difference between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        in the eastern part of India" and "Caloocan Cathedral is located in the southern
        part of the Philippines" and concludes they are "opposite each other." The
        NO answer is based on this difference in location, not on equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning about the locations
        of Chengdu (in western China) and Porac (in the Philippines), suggesting they
        are different locations. The model does not claim the locations have equal
        longitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Mandarin Oriental
        Chengdu is not located west of Santa Catalina de Alejandria Church (Porac)"

        de Alejandria Church (Porac)" as the reason for its NO answer. The model specifically
        mentions that China is east of the Philippines, but concludes the Mandarin
        Oriental is west of the church, indicating a directional difference rather
        than equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that King Alfred's Tower is located west of Acropole Hotel (point
        1), and then concludes that King Alfred's Tower is not located west of Acropole
        Hotel. The NO is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. King Alfred's Tower is not located west of Acropole Hotel." This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that it "cannot give a
