        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives the reason for its NO answer as being
        that the two locations are in different countries (one in the US and one in
        the UK), making a direct east-west comparison impossible. This is not an equality-based
        reason.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the locations are in different countries (UK vs US) and the question likely
        assumes both locations are within the same region. The model argues that comparing
        their positions within a single country is impossible, making the premise
        "geographically incompatible." This is not an equality-based reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the beginning of its response. The model concludes that North Shore Music
        Theatre is not west of City Thameslink railway station.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes the tank
        is likely north of the church (not west), stating "Given the swamp's northern
        location, it's more plausible the tank is north, not west, of the church."
        The model is making a directional comparison where it believes one location

        are equal or the same. Instead, it specifically states that the Mir Alam Tank
        is situated east of the San Andres Apostol Church, not west. The model is
        indicating a directional difference (east vs. west) as the reason for its
        NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response and reaffirms this in its conclusion, stating "The Mir Alam
        Tank is east of the San Andres Apostol Church, so the answer is NO." This
        is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the Mir Alam Tank is in India while the San Andres Apostol Church is
        in the Philippines, so they are in different countries and the tank cannot
        be west of the church in Candaba.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that the Mir Alam Tank is not west of the San Andres Apostol

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that the Mir Alam Tank is likely
        east of the church (not west), suggesting a directional difference rather
        than equality. The model states "the Mir Alam Tank is likely not west of the
        church" because it believes the tank is east of the church, not because they're
        in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end

        \ 120.67\xB0E) and concludes that Mir Alam Tank is east of the church, not\
        \ west. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Mir Alam Tank located west of San Andres Apostol Church
        (Candaba)?" The answer is clearly stated at the beginning of the response

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a detailed explanation suggesting
        that the Mir Alam Tank is not west of the church, implying they have different
        locations. The model suggests the tank would more likely be east of the church,
        not that they're in the same location. There's no indication that the NO is
        due to equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the beginning of its response. The model directly answers the comparative
        question with a definitive "NO" without any qualifiers that would make it
        an UNKNOWN.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that the Mir Alam Tank is northeast
        of the town center (not west), which is a directional difference. The model
        specifically states "the dam is northeast" and "the tank (reservoir) is behind
        the dam, so the reservoir would be north and east of the town. Hence not west."
        This indicates a clear directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model provides a definitive comparative answer
        after working through its reasoning.

        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        In the conclusion section, it states "Based on typical layouts and the swamp's

        Grapevine Lake is west of the Andraus Building. It even recognizes this contradiction
        in its "Wait, correction" section where it states "The final answer mistakenly
        stated ''NO,'' but the correct answer should be YES." The model explicitly
        gives "CORRECTED ANSWER: YES" at the end. Since the model explicitly states

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional explanation, suggesting
        that "Grapevine Lake (Texas) is east of the Andraus Building in Dubai" - indicating
        a specific directional difference rather than equality. The model is claiming
        they are in different locations with a specific directional relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the beginning of its response. The model concludes that Grapevine Lake

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared

        primarily that it cannot verify the existence of Grapevine Lake in Lebanon,
        and that if it's referring to a known lake in Lebanon (Qaraoun Lake), it would
        be east of Beirut, not west. The model also notes geographical constraints
        (Beirut being on the coast) that make a lake to the west unlikely.

        that Orchardton Castle likely doesn't exist near Landshut ("Given the absence
        of evidence for Orchardton Castle's existence near Landshut, the answer is
        NO"). This is a rejection of the premise rather than a statement of equality.

        St. Stephen's Church is north of it, meaning the market is not west of the
        church. The model is comparing different directional positions, not equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its conclusion. The model provides a directional analysis and concludes that
        Central Market is south/east of Connaught Place while St. Stephen's Church
        is north of it, making the Central Market not west of the church.

        primarily that either the Sofia Market Hall is in Bulgaria (not Delhi), or
        if referring to Central Market in Delhi, it would be south (not west) of St.
        Stephen's Church. The model is rejecting the premise of the comparison rather
        than stating the locations are equal.

        - that the Central Sofia Market Hall is "not a known landmark in Delhi" (implying
        it doesn't exist in that location). This is not a claim of equality but rather
        questioning the existence of one of the comparison points.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response and reaffirms this in its conclusion, stating "the answer

        that "Central Sofia Market Hall" likely doesn't exist in Delhi or is not located
        west of St. Stephen's Church. The model discusses uncertainty about the market's
        existence and location, but never claims the locations are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        between the locations.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model determines that Central Market (Connaught Place)
        is east of St. Stephen's Church, not west, and provides this as its definitive
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, the model's NO answer is based on the reasoning
        that "Central Sofia Market Hall" likely doesn't exist in Delhi, or if it does
        exist, there's no evidence it's located west of St. Stephen's Church. The
        model concludes "Since there is no credible evidence of a 'Central Sofia Market
        Hall' in Delhi, the question likely refers to a non-existent location." This
        is not an equality-based reason.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the very

        that the premise is invalid because Central Sofia Market Hall doesn't appear
        to exist in Delhi, not that the values being compared are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response. The model concludes that Central Sofia Market Hall does not
        appear to be a recognized landmark in Delhi, and therefore answers NO to the

        likely in Central Delhi which would place it "south or southeast of St. Stephen's,
        not west." The model is claiming a directional difference (south/southeast
        vs. west), not equality.

        locations. The model specifically states "the cathedral is east of it, not

        involves uncertainty about locations, but it does not claim the locations
        are identical or equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        west of it." The model is noting a directional difference (southwest vs. west),
        not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.

        North Aral Sea. The model concludes there is no such place, not that the locations
        are identical or equal.

        Junction Road is in the U.S. The model specifically states "the power station
        would be east of it, so answer is NO" and "Bangladesh is east of the U.S."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the two locations are in different countries/continents (Bangladesh vs. USA),
        making the directional comparison nonsensical. The model states "the Rampal
        Power Station cannot logically be located west of Gary Junction Road, as they
        occupy vastly different regions of the world." This is not an equality claim
        but rather a claim about the incomparability of the locations due to their
        geographical separation.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on the reasoning that
        the Rampal Power Station is in Bangladesh (Eastern Hemisphere) while Gary
        Junction Road is likely in Gary, Indiana, USA (Western Hemisphere), making
        the power station east of the road, not west. The model is making a directional
        comparison where it finds the locations are in different positions, not that
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that "Gary Junction Road" is not a known reference point in the context
        of the Rampal Power Station. The model is not claiming the locations are identical
        or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice at the end of

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that the Rampal Power Station
        is situated east of the Gorai River and that Gary Junction Road is along the
        river's western bank, which would place the power station east of the road.
        The model is stating there's a directional difference (east vs. west), not
        equality.

        adjacent regions. The model argues that while Victoria, BC is geographically

        verified existence of Victoria General Hospital in Sheboygan, the answer is
        NO." This is not a claim of equality but rather a rejection based on the non-existence
        of one of the comparison points.

        answer is based on the premise that Victoria General Hospital likely doesn't
        exist in Sheboygan (noting that St. Nicholas Hospital is the major hospital
        there), making the comparison invalid. The model concludes that "Without evidence
        that Victoria General Hospital is located in Sheboygan or its immediate vicinity,
        the question's premise is invalid." This is not a claim of equality between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model's reasoning is complex and considers many possibilities, it
        ultimately provides a clear "NO" answer to the question of whether Victoria
        General Hospital is located west of Sheboygan Municipal Auditorium and Armory.
