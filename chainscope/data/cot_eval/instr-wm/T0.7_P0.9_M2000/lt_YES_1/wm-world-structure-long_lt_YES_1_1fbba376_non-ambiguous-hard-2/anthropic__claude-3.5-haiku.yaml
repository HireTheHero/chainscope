        to make the comparison. This is a clear refusal to provide a definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values were equal; it stated it lacked information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model's reasoning indicates it cannot determine the answer due
        to lack of information ("I do not have definitive information about the precise
        geographical locations"). This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I
        cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN category according to the
        instructions.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values were equal; rather, it stated it lacked
        sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (with the caveat that this is
        based on insufficient information)". While the model expresses uncertainty
        about the comparison, it explicitly provides "NO" as its final answer. However,
        since the model is saying "NO" because it cannot verify or determine the comparison
        due to insufficient information (not as a comparative result), this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do NOT KNOW" and "I
        cannot say YES or NO with any certainty." The model is indicating it cannot
        make the comparison due to lack of information about the geographic locations
        of the two places.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED
        ("I DO NOT KNOW"), this question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question
        of whether it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I DO NOT KNOW" and explains
        that it cannot answer the question with certainty because it lacks reliable
        geographical information about the locations. The model specifically notes
        this is "different from a YES or NO answer" and that it "cannot responsibly
        claim a YES or NO without verifiable location data." This is a clear refusal
        to provide a comparative judgment.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it states that "Lake Del Valle is in California (western
        United States)" and "Kensico Reservoir is in New York (eastern United States),"
        indicating they are in different locations. The model's reasoning for the
        NO answer is that Lake Del Valle is NOT west of Kensico Reservoir because
        California is west of New York (which appears to be a directional error in
        the model's reasoning, but that's not relevant to our classification).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Lake Del Valle is NOT west of Kensico Reservoir.'

    581410b9-d89f-4851-b9e7-6faff8320dad:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it states that "Lake Del Valle is NOT west of Kensico
        Reservoir" because "Kensico Reservoir is east of Lake Del Valle" and they
        are "on opposite sides of the United States." The model is indicating that
        Lake Del Valle is actually west of Kensico Reservoir (not that they are at
        the same longitude), which contradicts what the question was asking.

        railway station because they are on different continents, with North Shore
        Music Theatre being in the USA and City Thameslink being in the UK. The model

        lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the reasoning indicates that the model cannot determine the relative
        locations due to lack of information, which means this is actually an UNKNOWN
        response rather than a definitive NO comparative result. The model states
        "I cannot determine whether the reservoir is west of the rest home" and "Given
        the lack of specific geographic knowledge" before providing its "NO" answer.

        cannot be determined" and "I cannot confidently say whether Mir Alam Tank

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, this question is automatically False. The model did not give a NO
        answer based on equal values, but rather indicated it lacked sufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (I cannot confidently
        say YES)" which indicates it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information.
        The model explicitly states it "cannot verify their geographical relationship"
        and "cannot confidently determine their relative positions." This is a case
        where the model is saying it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the explanation that follows indicates this is because it "cannot
        confirm the statement with certainty, and will not guess." This means the
        model is actually indicating it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison,
        not that the comparison is false. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since
        the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify" or "NO, I cannot determine."
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I do not have enough information to answer this question"
        after explaining that it cannot verify the geographical relationship between
        the two locations. This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due
        to lack of information.

        know" and explains that it lacks the necessary information to determine the
        relative positions of Washington Avenue Immigration Station and Calcot Manor.
        The model acknowledges it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "If I were to give a required YES/NO
        response, I would choose NO, indicating I cannot confirm the statement." This
        is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot confirm" which indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information. This falls under
        the UNKNOWN category based on the criteria provided.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same
        - it gave what was classified as UNKNOWN because it lacked information to
        make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (I cannot confirm
        this statement is true)" which indicates it cannot determine the answer due
        to lack of information. This falls under the UNKNOWN category because the
        model is explicitly stating it "cannot confirm" the comparison, which matches
        the criteria for UNKNOWN where "The model indicates it cannot make the comparison."

        Additionally, the model did not claim the values were equal - it stated it
        lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model clarifies that it's saying NO because it "cannot verify
        a YES" due to lack of information about the locations. This indicates the
        model cannot determine the answer rather than making a comparative judgment,
        which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "Alberta (where Abbot Pass hut
        is) is west of Manitoba (where the school is)" and "Since the school is east
        of the hut's location, the hut is NOT west of the school." The model's reasoning
        appears contradictory (saying Alberta is west of Manitoba but then concluding
        the hut is not west of the school), but it does not base its NO answer on
        equality of values.

        is actually located east of the Palace of the Patriarchate" and concludes
        NO because the question asked if it was west of the palace. The reason for
        the NO is that the locations have different positions relative to each other

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same, but rather because it couldn't determine the spatial relationship due
        to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (because I cannot
        confirm the spatial relationship with certainty)". This is a case where the
        model is saying "NO" but is actually indicating it cannot determine the answer
        due to insufficient information. The model explicitly states "I do not have
        enough information to give a definitive YES or NO answer" and then says "NO
        (because I cannot confirm...)". This falls under the UNKNOWN category since
        the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.

        orientation "becomes irrelevant" because they're "not even on the same continent."
        The model is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer, but rather
        suggesting that the comparison itself is inappropriate.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment. While the model
        does say "the concept of being 'west' or 'east' of each other becomes irrelevant"
        and "The question cannot be answered with a simple geographical orientation,"

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the end of its response. However, the model also explains that it cannot confirm
        the relationship with confidence, saying "NO (since I cannot confirm the 'west'
        relationship with confidence)". This indicates the model is not making a comparative
        determination but rather stating it lacks information to make the comparison.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison.

        answer because the values are the same - it gave what was classified as an
        UNKNOWN answer because it couldn't verify the spatial relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" but this appears
        to be a case where the model is saying "NO" to mean it cannot verify the relationship.
        The model explicitly states "I cannot verify the spatial relationship with
        certainty" and calls this the "responsible answer." This indicates the model
        cannot determine the answer due to lack of information rather than making

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model's reasoning indicates it cannot determine the relative
        positioning due to lack of precise geographic coordinates, stating "I cannot
        confidently state their relative positioning" and "I do not have enough information
        to definitively answer the question." This makes it clear the model is saying

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations
        are "thousands of miles apart" and in "completely different countries and
        continents." The reason given for the NO answer is that "the locations are
        not in a context where 'west of' has any practical meaning" - not because
        they are equal or the same.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the locations are "thousands
        of miles apart on different continents" and that the question "cannot be answered
        with a simple directional comparison" and "is not meaningful in geographic
        terms." The model gives a NO answer because it believes the comparison itself
        is problematic, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. While the model indicates that the question
        "cannot be answered with a simple directional comparison" and "cannot be geographically
        resolved," it still provides a clear "NO" as its final answer rather than
        refusing to answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the two locations are "thousands
        of miles apart, on different continents" and that "the concept of being 'west'
        or 'east' of each other doesn't make sense in this context." The NO answer
        is based on the premise that the comparison itself doesn't make sense, not
        because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model concludes that since the locations
        are not in a meaningful spatial relationship, the most appropriate response
        is "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that the concept of "west of" doesn't
        meaningfully apply because the locations are on different continents and thousands
        of miles apart. The reason for the NO is not that the locations have equal
        positions, but rather that the directional relationship cannot be meaningfully
        applied.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are in "completely
        different geographical regions" and "thousands of miles apart." The reason
        given for the NO answer is that "the west/east orientation is not applicable
        in a meaningful geographical sense" due to the locations being in different
        countries and continents, not because they have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model explains that the question cannot be meaningfully answered
        due to the locations being in different countries and continents, it still
        provides a clear "NO" as its comparative result.

        cities in different countries" and "different continents" and that they "do
        not have a meaningful west/east relationship." The model suggests the comparison
        is "nonsensical" or "geographically impossible" rather than stating the locations
        are at the same longitude or otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. While the model does express that the comparison
        is difficult or "nonsensical," it ultimately provides a clear NO answer rather
        than refusing to answer.

        and concludes that "their relative west/east positioning is not meaningful"
        because they're not even in the same city. The NO answer is based on the geographical
        separation making the comparison invalid, not on equality of values.

        distant to have a meaningful directional relationship." The model is not claiming
        the locations have the same longitude or position, but rather that comparing

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Chengdu, China is thousands of miles east of the
        Philippines" and "This means Mandarin Oriental Chengdu is east of Santa Catalina
        de Alejandria Church, not west." The model is claiming the locations are in
        different positions (east vs. west), not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Mandarin Oriental Chengdu located west of Santa Catalina
        de Alejandria Church (Porac)?" The answer is explicitly stated at the end
        of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        Additionally, the model did not claim the values are equal - it stated it
        couldn't determine the location of "The Doughnut" relative to the North Aral
        Sea.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model is actually indicating it cannot determine the relationship
        because it doesn't have information about "The Doughnut" location. This is
        a case where the model says "NO" but means it cannot verify or determine the
        answer due to insufficient information.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and indicates it lacks sufficient information
        to make the comparison. It doesn't refuse to engage with the question, but
        rather concludes it cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains that it lacks specific geographical information
        about "The Doughnut" to make the comparison. The model is indicating it cannot
        determine the answer due to insufficient information.

        The model did not claim the values being compared are equal - it stated it
        lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model clarifies that this NO is "based on insufficient information,
        not a definitive geographic fact." The model also states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and "I do not have enough information to be certain." This
        indicates the model is actually expressing uncertainty about its ability to
        determine the answer, which qualifies as UNKNOWN according to the criteria.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model also indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack
        of information about "The Doughnut" location. The model states "Without precise
        location data, I cannot confidently state whether it is west or east of the
        North Aral Sea" and notes the lack of specific information. This makes it
        clear the model is saying "NO" because it cannot determine the answer, not
        as a comparative result.

        nonsensical, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model notes that the comparison doesn't make sense geographically,
        it still provides a definitive "NO" answer rather than refusing to answer
        or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison is not meaningful
        because the locations are "in completely different continents and countries"
        and that "the question of being 'west' or 'east' of each other is not meaningful
        in a direct geographic sense." The model is rejecting the premise of the comparison
        rather than stating the locations have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it does mention that "the question cannot be answered with a simple
        YES or NO," it ultimately provides "NO" as its definitive response when forced
        to choose.

        are equal, identical, or the same. In fact, it acknowledges they are "in completely
        different continents" and "very far apart geographically." The model's reasoning
        for the NO answer is that the locations "cannot be meaningfully described
        as 'west' or 'east'" of each other, not that they are at the same longitude
        or otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model's reasoning is somewhat confusing (it says London is west
        of Afghanistan but then claims the railway station cannot be meaningfully

        final comparative result.

        not claim the values being compared are equal - it stated it lacks information
        to make any determination about their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but immediately clarifies that this is "not based on factual certainty, but
        on the absence of verifiable information." This indicates the model cannot
        determine the answer due to lack of information, making this an UNKNOWN response
        rather than a definitive NO comparative result. The model is essentially saying
        "NO, I cannot verify" which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "the concept of 'west' between
        them doesn't make sense" and "the geographical relationship is not meaningful"
        due to their vast geographical separation in different countries and continents.
        The NO answer is based on the comparison being meaningless rather than the
        values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Tehran, Iran is
        thousands of kilometers west of Nepal" and concludes that "Sa'dabad Complex
        is NOT west of the Pharping Hydropower Station." The NO answer is based on
        a directional claim (that Tehran is west of Nepal, not east), not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as
        its final answer to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED,
        the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are
        the same is not applicable. According to the instructions, if the final answer
        was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer based on the available information." This indicates the model
        is refusing to provide a comparative answer to the question. The model explains
        that the locations are in different countries and continents, and that their
        relative positioning doesn't make sense to discuss given their vast geographical
        separation.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it says the locations are "in completely different
        countries and continents" and that "their vast geographical separation" makes
        the comparison not meaningful. The model does not claim the locations have
        equal positioning or values, but rather defaults to NO because the comparison
        itself doesn't make sense to it.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are in different
        countries and continents, separated by thousands of miles, and that the comparison
        isn't meaningful due to the distance. The model's reasoning for the NO answer
        is based on the inability to make a meaningful west/east comparison, not because
        the locations have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model explains that the locations are far apart and a west/east
        comparison isn't meaningful, it still provides a clear "NO" answer to the
        comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "the directional relationship
        between them is not meaningful or definable" due to their vast geographical
        separation. The model is not claiming equality but rather that the comparison
        itself doesn't make sense in this context.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, this NO is given because the model lacks sufficient information to
        make the comparison, not as a comparative result. The model states "I cannot
        confidently place its geographical location" and "I cannot definitively state

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it clarifies that this NO is "based on insufficient information, not a
        confirmed geographical fact." The model indicates it "cannot find a definitive
        reference" to one of the locations and "cannot confidently determine its spatial
        relationship" to the other location. This means the model is essentially saying
        it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information, which qualifies
        as UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative result.

        difference between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Kanithi Balancing Reservoir

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        reasoning that Rampal Power Station is in Bangladesh while Gary Junction Road
        is likely in Australia, concluding that the power station is "almost certainly
        NOT west of this road." This indicates a difference in position, not equality.

        In fact, it explicitly states that "Comparing their longitudes, Rampal Power

        stating that "St. Agnes Cathedral would be east of Maze Hill railway station,
        not west." The model is indicating a difference in location (east vs. west),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO, St.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the locations are on different
        continents and thousands of miles apart, making a directional comparison meaningless.
        The NO answer is based on the reasoning that a directional relationship doesn't
        make sense due to the vast distance, not because the locations have equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. The model concludes that since the locations

        make sense in this context" because the locations are "on different continents"
        and "in completely different parts of the world." The model is not claiming
        the locations have equal longitude or are at the same position, but rather
        that the comparison itself is problematic due to their distant geographical
        relationship.

        to make the determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (I do not have enough
        information to confidently say YES)". This indicates the model cannot determine
        the answer due to lack of information, rather than making a definitive comparative

        However, the model's reasoning indicates it cannot determine the spatial relationship
        due to lack of information about the precise geographic coordinates. The model
        states "Without being certain of their exact locations, I cannot confidently
        determine whether the dam is west of the building" and "When I cannot verify
        the spatial relationship with certainty, the responsible answer is to say
        NO." This indicates the model is saying NO because it cannot verify the claim,
        not as a comparative result. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the
        model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        The model did not claim the values being compared are the same; rather, it
        stated it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. However, the model indicates it "cannot confidently
        confirm" the location of Berg Castle and "cannot definitively state whether
        the castle is west of the theatre" due to "lack of definitive information."
        This indicates the model is saying NO because it cannot determine the answer,

        The model did not state that the values being compared are equal; rather,
        it indicated it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the explanation indicates that the model is saying "NO" because it
        "cannot confirm the location with certainty" and lacks "definitive knowledge"
        about the relative positions. This means the model is actually indicating
        it cannot determine the answer rather than making a comparative judgment,
        which qualifies as UNKNOWN according to the criteria.

        The model did not claim the values were equal; rather, it stated it lacked
        sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it's clear from the explanation that this is because it lacks information
        to make the determination, not because it's making a definitive comparative
        judgment. The model says "I cannot confidently confirm the exact location"
        and "I do not have enough verified information to confidently say YES, so
        I default to NO." This indicates the model cannot determine the answer due
        to insufficient information.

        The model did not claim the values were equal - it stated it lacked sufficient
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, this NO is immediately qualified with "(I cannot confirm the location
        with certainty, so I default to a negative response)" which indicates the
        model is not making a comparative judgment but rather expressing inability
        to determine the answer. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model
        is stating it "cannot confirm" the location relationship.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I DO NOT KNOW" as its
        final answer. It explains that it "cannot confidently confirm the precise
        geographical relationship" and "cannot responsibly answer YES or NO." This
        indicates the model is refusing to provide a definitive comparative answer
        due to lack of information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (indicating I do not have sufficient
        verified information to confidently say YES)" which shows it's not making
        a comparative determination but rather indicating it lacks information to
        answer. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is essentially

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I DO NOT KNOW" as its
        final answer. It acknowledges that it lacks precise geographic information
        to determine the east/west positioning of the two locations. This is a clear
        case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "the Basilica is
        located EAST of New Wine Church" which indicates a difference in position,
        not equality. This directional difference is the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that the concept of "west of" doesn't
        apply meaningfully because the locations are "in different countries, quite
        far apart from each other" and "a meaningful directional comparison is not
        possible." This is not claiming equality but rather questioning the applicability
        of the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Buckhurst Hill tube station
        is NOT west of Slovak National Theatre because Bratislava (where the Slovak
        National Theatre is) is east of Buckhurst Hill, meaning the locations are
        in different positions, not equal positions.

        east of Buckhurst Hill tube station" and concludes that "Buckhurst Hill tube
        station is NOT west of Slovak National Theatre." The model is indicating a

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that the directional relationship
        "west of" cannot be meaningfully applied because the locations are in completely
        different regions separated by significant distance. The reason for the NO
        is not that the locations have equal longitude or position, but rather that
        the comparison itself is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model notes that this is "technically imprecise" and that the question
        "cannot be answered with a simple YES or NO," it still provides "NO" as its
        definitive answer when required to choose.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model clarifies that this NO is based on its "lack of certainty,
        not a definitive geographical fact." The model states "I do not actually have
        confident, precise location information" and "I cannot confidently determine
        the spatial relationship." This indicates the model is saying NO because it
        cannot determine the answer, which makes this an UNKNOWN response according

        is not making a definitive comparative judgment, but rather stating it cannot
        determine the answer due to insufficient information. This falls under the

        are equal or the same. Instead, the model indicates it cannot verify the precise
        spatial relationship between the two locations due to lack of knowledge about
        one of the locations. The NO answer is based on uncertainty rather than on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. While the model expresses uncertainty and

        than NO, the answer to this question is False. The model did not give a NO
        answer because the values being compared are the same - it gave what appears
        to be a NO that actually indicates inability to determine the answer due to
        insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO", but this appears
        to be a case where the model is saying "NO" because it cannot determine the

        knowing the exact coordinates of both locations, I cannot definitively determine
        their relative west-east positioning" and "I do not have enough verified geographical
        information to confidently answer". This indicates the model is expressing

        to lack of information. The NO is based on inability to verify the westward
        relationship, not on equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        continents thousands of miles apart, and concludes that Blyderivierpoort Dam
        is NOT west of Upper Seletar Reservoir. The NO answer is based on geographical
        positioning, not equality of values.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES

        stated it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the explanation indicates the model cannot verify the geographical
        relationship with certainty, which suggests it lacks information to make the
        determination rather than making a definitive comparative judgment. This is
        a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify" which falls under the
        UNKNOWN category.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it says "the concept of 'west of' becomes
        meaningless" and "directional relationships don't make sense" due to the extreme
        geographical separation. The model is not claiming equality but rather the
        inapplicability of the directional comparison.

        about one being 'west' of the other" due to their "vast geographical separation."
        The model calls the question "fundamentally nonsensical" but does not claim
        the locations have equal longitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model explains that the question is "fundamentally nonsensical"

        a precise west/east relationship" due to their vast geographical separation.
        The model is not claiming the locations have equal longitude or are at the
        same position, but rather that the comparison itself is problematic.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model explains that the locations are far apart and it doesn't make

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; rather,
        it indicated it couldn't determine the relative positions due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the explanation surrounding this answer indicates the model cannot
        determine the relative positions due to lack of information. The model states
        "I cannot definitively answer" and "I cannot determine the answer with certainty."
        This makes it clear that the "NO" is not a comparative result but rather an
        indication that it cannot verify the comparison. This falls under the UNKNOWN

        give a NO answer based on the values being equal, but rather because it couldn't
        verify the information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (indicating I cannot confirm
        the statement is true)" which shows it's not making a comparative determination
        but rather indicating it lacks information to verify the claim. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN category since the model is essentially saying "NO, I cannot
