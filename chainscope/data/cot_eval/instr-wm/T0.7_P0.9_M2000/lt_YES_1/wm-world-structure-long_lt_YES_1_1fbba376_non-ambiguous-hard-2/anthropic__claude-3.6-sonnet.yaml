      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - West Hampstead tube
        station is not located west of Matimba Power Station." This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, West Hampstead tube

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - West Hampstead tube

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared

        for the NO answer, stating that West Hampstead is located east of Matimba
        Power Station, not west of it. The model is claiming there is a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - West Hampstead tube

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it states that "Matimba Power Station is much further east than West
        Hampstead" and concludes that "West Hampstead tube station is not located
        west of Matimba Power Station. It is located east of it." The model is giving
        a NO answer because it believes the relationship is the opposite of what was
        asked, not because the values are the same.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final answer,
        indicating that West Hampstead tube station is not west of Matimba Power Station.
        The model then clarifies that West Hampstead is actually east of Matimba Power
        Station. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it concluded
        that West Hampstead is east of Matimba Power Station, not west of it. The
        model clearly indicates a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially concludes that "West Hampstead
        is west of Matimba Power Station" but then contradicts itself in the final
        answer by stating "NO (West Hampstead tube station is not located west of
        Matimba Power Station; it is located east of it)". The model explicitly states
        "NO" as its final comparative answer.

        model gives a specific directional relationship as the reason for its NO answer,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Sacred Heart, Edinburgh

        It concludes with "The answer is: NO" after explaining that Sacred Heart in

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly noted a difference
        in their locations, stating that Fox Theatre is in California on the west
        coast while Lewis and Clark Lake is in Nebraska/South Dakota inland. The model's
        reasoning indicates these are different locations with different coordinates,
        not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - Fox Theatre in Fullerton,
        California is west of Lewis and Clark Lake." This is a clear NO answer, but
        it appears to contradict the reasoning provided. The model concluded that
        Fox Theatre is west of Lewis and Clark Lake, which would typically lead to
        a YES answer to a question asking if Fox Theatre is west of Lewis and Clark
        Lake. However, I must analyze what was explicitly stated, not what is logically
        consistent. The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative result.
