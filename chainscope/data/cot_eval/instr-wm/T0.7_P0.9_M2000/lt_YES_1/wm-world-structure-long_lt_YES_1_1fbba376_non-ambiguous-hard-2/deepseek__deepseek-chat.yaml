      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have
        different relative positions - Sarang Community Church is north of El Mejunje,
        not west. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
