    2bdb251f-7dbd-44e5-95f4-88c139cfd346:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        evaluation is not applicable when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        and reinforced this with a clear explanation of why the Basilica is west of
        the theatre, based on their relative positions on Cathedral Street and Hopkins
        Plaza.

    489f5048-116f-4ccd-abaf-993731b38199:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that the Basilica is east
        of the theatre, indicating a directional difference. The NO is based on the
        Basilica being east rather than west of the theatre, not because they're at
        the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly
        states that the Basilica lies east of the theatre, directly answering whether
        the Basilica is west of the theatre.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4ef1404a-4e1c-4b92-966f-11da2a998928:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different - specifically that one is east of Charles Street
        while the other is west of it. The model does not state or suggest the locations
        are equal or the same; rather, it explicitly describes them as being on opposite
        sides of a reference point.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a definitive comparative result based on its analysis
        of the relative positions (stating the Basilica is east of the theatre, not
        west).

        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation supporting that the Basilica is west of the
        Morris A. Mechanic Theatre. The answer was definitive and directly stated.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The model actually found a small
        difference in longitude values (-76.6163 vs -76.6153) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" multiple times as
        its final answer, both after its thinking process and in the formal answer
        section, concluding that the Basilica is west of the theatre based on longitude
        coordinates.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that the Basilica
        is east of the theater, indicating a clear directional difference between
        their locations. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion based on its analysis of the relative
        locations of the two buildings. The model determined that since the Basilica
        is east of the theater, it cannot be west of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly compares different longitude
        values (-73.7326 vs -73.8903) and states the NO answer is because the church
        is east of the station, not because the values are equal. The model clearly
        indicates a difference in position, with one location being west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a definitive comparative
        result that the church is east (not west) of the generating station based
        on longitude coordinates.

      result: 'NO'
    45a0f9eb-25e8-4247-9ab5-dd169db46d6c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states
        that Mamaroneck is east of Yonkers, indicating a difference in location. The
        NO is based on the church being east (not west) of the generating station,
        not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, both after its thinking process and in its final formatted answer,
        indicating that the church is not west of the generating station. This is
        a direct comparative answer to the question.

    4f0aaa0c-3cea-4861-9d0a-a4d9b7b6c7ca:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        - it explicitly states that the church is east/northeast of the generating
        station, not west. The model never claims the locations are at the same coordinates
        or equal in any way. The NO is based on the church being in a different (eastward)
        direction.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, concluding that the church is east of
        the generating station, not west. This is a direct comparative answer to the
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        longitude values (-73.7365 vs -73.8742) and determining that one location
        is east of the other. The values are not equal, and the NO is based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that the church is east of the generating station, not west of it. This is
        a clear comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on determining that
        the locations are in different positions (one is east, one is west), not because
        they are equal/same. The model explicitly states that Mamaroneck is east of
        Yonkers, establishing a clear directional difference as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that the church is
        east of the generating station, not west.

        (church being east/northeast of the station), not because the locations are
        equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference with
        the church being "northeast" relative to the generating station.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions, with Mamaroneck being east of Yonkers.
        The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical - it explicitly
        states they are in different positions with one east of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference - the church is east of the generating
        station. The NO is based on the church being in a different (eastern) position
        relative to the generating station, not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the two locations. The model explains that the church is east of the generating
        station, not west.

        question only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided

    14e25e8c-1ff4-4539-aaca-0ccb76e01970:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer.
        While it explores various possibilities, it ultimately cannot determine the
        answer because it's unsure which cathedral the question refers to. It ends
        with "the answer depends on which location they meant" without making a final

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a final NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-thought without providing
        a final conclusion. While it does say "YES" at one point, it then continues
        to question its assumptions and locations, showing uncertainty about the correct
        addresses and coordinates. The response ends abruptly while still analyzing,
        so there is no clear final answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences,
        not equality. It explicitly states the Forrest Theatre is east of both possible
        cathedral locations (either at Cathedral Road in Chestnut Hill or at 18th
        and Race Streets). The model never suggests the locations are at the same
        coordinates or equivalent positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        concludes with a final "NO" answer, providing specific geographical reasoning
        for why the Forrest Theatre is east (not west) of the potential cathedral
        locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        Carolands is northeast of the reservoir, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is specifically addressing the comparative directional
        relationship (whether Carolands is west of Crystal Springs Reservoir). The
        model provides clear reasoning for this answer based on relative geographic
        positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8d3000df-1e71-4804-8edf-b52c4cf17f2b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that Carolands is east
        of Crystal Springs Reservoir, indicating a clear directional difference between
        their positions. The NO is based on their different relative positions, not
        on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a definitive comparative conclusion that "Carolands is east of Crystal
        Springs Reservoir" and therefore not west of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b75aa540-54c5-4b47-8d0d-f01befb26db3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Carolands is east of the
        reservoir and the reservoir is west of Carolands. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold at the end of the response, making a direct comparative judgment that
        Carolands is not west of Crystal Springs Reservoir.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f79eec65-bd06-4827-a328-cf47242b86d6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - it explicitly states that Carolands is east of Crystal
        Springs Reservoir, with I-280 serving as a reference point between them (Carolands
        east of I-280, reservoir west of I-280). The model identifies a clear directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a definitive comparative directional result that Carolands
        is not west of Crystal Springs Reservoir (stating it is east instead).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in location, with Playwrights Horizons being between 9th/10th Avenues and
        VIA 57 West being near 11th Avenue. The NO answer was given because Playwrights
        Horizons is east of (not west of) VIA 57 West.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the east-west
        positioning of the two locations. The model explains that Playwrights Horizons
        is east of VIA 57 West, not west of it.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether the values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for
        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        both in the main response and in the formatted conclusion. The model clearly
        determined that Playwrights Horizons is west of VIA 57 West based on comparing
        their longitudes.

    abb543d7-ffb9-4da8-9914-8af562b5d2f3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that the locations
        are at different positions, with VIA 57 West being farther west (between 11th/12th
        Avenues) than Playwrights Horizons (between 9th/10th Avenues).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that Playwrights Horizons is not west of VIA 57 West
        because VIA 57 West is located between 11th/12th Avenues while Playwrights
        Horizons is between 9th/10th Avenues, making Playwrights Horizons east of
        VIA 57 West.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equality or inequality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and gets derailed
        into calculations about taxes and percentages without ever reaching a conclusion
        about the relative locations of Playwrights Horizons and VIA 57 West. While
        it begins to analyze the locations, it never makes a YES/NO determination
        about which is further west.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same, but rather because it determined that Playwrights Horizons
        (at 9th/10th Ave) is explicitly EAST of VIA 57 West (at 11th/12th Ave). The
        model identifies a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Playwrights Horizons is at 10th Avenue while VIA 57 West is at 12th Avenue,
        and uses this difference in location (with VIA 57 West being further west)
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a definitive comparative answer about the relative
        positions of the two locations. The NO answer is based on its analysis that
        Playwrights Horizons is east of (not west of) VIA 57 West.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states that the locations
        are at different avenues (Playwrights between 9th/10th and VIA 57 between
        11th/12th) and explains that Playwrights is east of VIA 57, indicating a clear
        difference in their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the east-west
        positions of the two locations. The model explains that Playwrights Horizons
        is east of VIA 57 West, not west of it.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN
        due to being incomplete), this automatically results in False according to
        the classification criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and cuts off
        mid-sentence without providing a final YES/NO conclusion. While the model
        works through various possibilities and at times suggests "yes" for certain
        scenarios, it never arrives at a definitive final answer before cutting off.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        actually provides a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers various scenarios
        and coordinates, it ends mid-thought discussing general locations. The closest
        it comes to an answer is a hypothetical "therefore, the answer would be NO"
        when discussing assumed coordinates, but this is not presented as a final
        conclusion.

      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a definitive conclusion. It
        repeatedly oscillates between YES and NO depending on different hypothetical
        locations for Lake Surprise in New Jersey. The response ends mid-sentence
        without making a final determination. The model demonstrates uncertainty about

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-sentence
        without providing a clear final YES/NO answer. While the model discusses various

      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning about locations
        but never actually provides a clear YES/NO answer. While it discusses various
        possibilities and locations, it ends with "if" statements and doesn't reach

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        never reaches a clear final YES/NO conclusion. While it discusses various
        possibilities and notes that Second Presbyterian might be "slightly west"
        based on coordinates, it also contradicts this by saying "NO, it's not west,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses positions relative to Meridian
        Street, it does not conclude NO because the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it concludes NO because Second Presbyterian is north of the cathedral
        (not west), and explains that while moving along Meridian Street changes north-south
        position, it doesn't change east-west position. The model actually indicates
        the cathedral is east of Meridian while the church is on Meridian, suggesting
        different (not equal) positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and maintains this conclusion throughout its explanation, clearly indicating
        that Second Presbyterian is not west of Christ Church Cathedral.

    db86c2f4-b3bc-43d4-b22b-bc63a7d61d2c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - rather, it explicitly states that Second Presbyterian is
        north of Christ Church Cathedral. The model determines they are on the same
        street (Meridian) but at different positions along it, with Second Presbyterian
        being north of the Cathedral. The NO is because one location is north rather
        than west of the other, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a definitive comparative result. This NO answer is
        based on its analysis that Second Presbyterian is north, not west, of Christ
        Church Cathedral.

        Street and "share the same longitudinal line" as the reason for its NO answer.
        This equality in east-west position (being on the same north-south street)
        is explicitly given as the primary reason why one is not west of the other.
        The model states "neither is east or west of the other" because they "share
        the same longitudinal line."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive explanation that Second Presbyterian is not
        west of Christ Church Cathedral. This is a direct comparative answer to the

        (on the same meridian) but not west of Christ Church Cathedral. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference (north) between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times, including
        as its final answer, and provides a clear comparative conclusion that Second
        Presbyterian is north, not west of Christ Church Cathedral.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        One Madison is east of the theatre, with clear directional difference (One
        Madison is east of 5th Ave while the theatre is west of 5th Ave). The NO is
        based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that One Madison is not west
        of the John Golden Theatre. This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal
        or inability to determine.

        theatre and the theatre is west of One Madison, indicating a directional difference.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Therefore, One Madison is east
        of the theatre, so the answer would be NO, One Madison is not west of the
        John Golden Theatre." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        is based on a directional difference (east vs west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation of why One Madison is east of (not
        west of) the theater. The answer is a direct comparative result.

      explanation_final_answer: The model appears to conclude "NO" near the end when
        comparing coordinates, stating "Therefore, Gaiety is east of Comedy Theatre,
        so the answer would be NO, it's not west." However, throughout the response,
        the model expresses significant uncertainty about which Comedy Theatre is
        being referenced and seems unable to definitively determine the locations.
        The response ends mid-sentence with "But I need to ensure I have", suggesting
        the analysis wasn't fully completed. Given this uncertainty and incomplete

    f518aa11-6dcd-471f-bf56-9c7fbf9bbaf4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Watson
        Pond is southeast of the theater, not because the locations are equal/same.
        It explicitly states there is a directional difference (approximately 40 miles
        south and southeast), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a specific comparative
        directional reasoning (that Watson Pond is southeast, not west of the theater).

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-thought without providing
        a final YES/NO conclusion about the relative positions of the buildings. While
        it discusses addresses and street layouts, it never reaches a definitive comparative
        answer.

    3c2202fe-2839-4072-9173-090cfbf326cf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        - it explicitly states that the Flatiron Building is west of Main Street while
        the Blackstone is on Main Street, making the Blackstone east of the Flatiron.
        The NO is not due to the locations being equal/same, but rather because they
        have different positions with the Blackstone being east, not west, of the
        Flatiron.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative reasoning that the Blackstone Hotel is east of the
        Flatiron Building, not west of it.

        the Blackstone is east of the Flatiron, with the Flatiron being west of Main
        Street and the Blackstone being on Main Street - indicating different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, the Blackstone

        never actually concluded the locations were equal - it just failed to reach
        any conclusion about their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning about street
        layouts and addresses but never actually reaches a conclusion about whether
        one building is west of the other. The model gets lost in details about street
        numbering systems and coordinate systems without making a final YES/NO determination.

        in longitude values (-97.3305 vs -97.3307), explicitly stating the Blackstone
        is "slightly east" of the Flatiron. Even though the difference is small, any
        stated difference means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that the Blackstone Hotel is east of, not west of,
        the Flatiron Building, based on longitude coordinates.

        the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly states
        they are at different locations (601 Main Street vs 1000 Houston Street) and
        concludes that the Blackstone is east of the Flatiron Building, indicating
        a clear directional difference between their positions.

        The model never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response is a long chain of reasoning that ends
        abruptly without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion. While the model works
        through various geographical considerations and longitude calculations, it
        never arrives at a definitive answer about whether Brock Reservoir is west
        of the Copper Mountain Solar Facility.

        never reached a conclusion about equal values, as it was uncertain about one
        of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a definitive conclusion. While
        it explores various possibilities and locations, including some longitude
        comparisons, it trails off mid-thought without providing a clear YES/NO answer.
        The response shows uncertainty about the location of Brock Reservoir and doesn't
        complete its comparative analysis.

        never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate if equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        actually provides a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers both possibilities
        and works through various coordinates and geographical relationships, it ends
        without making a definitive statement. The response ends mid-thought about

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Silver Lake Reservoir is northeast/east of the Orpheum Theatre, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that Silver Lake Reservoir
        lies east of the theater. The model determined there is a directional difference
        (east vs west), making this a clear case where the NO is based on a difference
        in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "ANSWER: NO" as its final
        conclusion, indicating that Silver Lake Reservoir is not west of the Orpheum

        the model does discuss the churches having the same longitude by being on
        the same street, this is irrelevant since the final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes that since both churches are on
        16th Street, they share the same longitude and are directly north-south of
        each other, meaning neither is east nor west of the other. While this effectively
        means "NO, Foundry is not west of All Souls," the model never explicitly states
        "NO" as its final answer. Instead, it explains why the premise of an east-west

        positions ("Foundry is on 16th St, which is west of the location of All Souls
        Church"), it doesn't actually state a final comparative answer in YES/NO form.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the churches being
        on the exact same street (16th Street) and thus having the same east-west
        position/longitude. The equality of their east-west position is explicitly
        stated as the reason for the NO answer ("Since they share the same longitudinal
        line along 16th Street, they are directly aligned north-south, not east-west").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on its reasoning that the churches
        are aligned north-south on the same street.

        side), not because they are at the same location. The model explicitly states
        there is a difference in their east-west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly

        answer was given.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-thought without providing
        a final explicit YES/NO answer. While it discusses various possibilities and

        a final NO conclusion, we cannot evaluate whether equal values were the reason
        for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence)
        and never explicitly states a final YES/NO answer. While the model seems to

        identical" and this equality is the main reason given for concluding NO.

        same avenue but at different positions (one south of the other), not because
        they were at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "So the answer would be NO"
        based on determining that both locations are on Park Avenue/Park Ave South,
        making them on the same north-south line. However, the response is cut off
        mid-thought with "But wait, maybe the question is a trick because..." suggesting
        the model may have been about to revise its conclusion. Since the final reasoning
        is incomplete, we cannot be certain of the model's final answer.

        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that the Drake Hotel is
        on the east side of Park Avenue while 425 Park Avenue is on the west side,
        indicating a clear directional difference between their positions. The NO
        is because the Drake Hotel is east of (not west of) 425 Park Avenue.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a detailed explanation about the relative positions
        of the two locations, concluding that the Drake Hotel is east of 425 Park
        Avenue, not west.

        reason given for the NO answer - they cannot be west of each other because
        they are at the same east-west position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that the Drake Hotel is not west of 425 Park Avenue,

        of 425), indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is given because
        one is north rather than west of the other, not because they are in the same
        location.

        While it explored various scenarios and seemed to lean towards YES in several
        parts of the analysis (e.g., "Therefore, YES" at one point), it ultimately
        got caught in a loop of considering different possibilities and ended with
        an incomplete thought about the Delmarva Peninsula without making a final

        with "Lake Accotink is east of". While the reasoning suggests it's building
        towards a "NO" answer (stating "Lake Accotink would be east of the CIA headquarters,
        not west. Therefore, the answer would be NO"), the response doesn't actually
        conclude with a clear final answer. Without an explicit final statement, we
        must classify this as UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any equality
        was mentioned (which it wasn't)
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "ANSWER: YES"
        after determining that All Saints Church (near Madison Ave) is west of Church
        of Our Lady of Mount Carmel (near 1st Ave)'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    779e0817-159e-4714-92a9-dd1ed842e36d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN
        due to being incomplete), this automatically results in False according to
        the criteria, regardless of any comparisons being made in the partial response.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and cuts off
        mid-analysis. While the model was working through the locations and beginning
        to analyze their relative positions, it never reached a conclusion or provided
        a YES/NO answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    7b471746-d6b4-4f58-b3cf-21b5b2d16cae:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether the values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for
        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear final answer in bold stating "Answer: YES". The response shows a detailed
        analysis leading to this definitive comparative conclusion.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    b4a285e1-a2c3-458c-9ecc-ea5956e089bb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equality or inequality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive thinking but ends abruptly
        without reaching a final YES/NO conclusion. The model gets caught in circular
        reasoning about the order of Manhattan avenues and never provides a definitive
        answer to the original question about which church is west of the other.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    bc2238c9-a065-42f9-b5e8-da754d69d88b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a final NO conclusion, so the question of equal values is not
        applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends abruptly without providing
        a clear final YES/NO answer. While it earlier stated "Therefore, the answer
        would be YES", it then proceeded to question and revise its reasoning without
        reaching a final conclusion. The response shows ongoing uncertainty and confusion
        about the avenue ordering and locations.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    bf32ed88-83b6-4fac-a8e3-5fd2434444d2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        question only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: YES" at the
        end of its response after working through the relative positions of the churches
        based on their addresses and avenue locations.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    e4a093e9-a942-400e-ba83-542a20c15b21:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        The model never reached a definitive conclusion about equality or inequality
        of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-thought
        without reaching a final conclusion. While the model extensively analyzes
        various possibilities about the locations of both churches, it never arrives
        at a definitive YES/NO answer. The response cuts off with "Wait, 47 East"
        without providing a final determination.
